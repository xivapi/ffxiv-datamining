Parties formed with the Raid Finder do not allow for more than one pure healer and one barrier healer.

　・Barrier Healers: Scholar, Sage
　※Emphasis on actions that negate damage via magicked barriers."
9,"Party Progress","A party's starting point in the duty is determined by the leader's past progress. As long as all other conditions are met, players who have not progressed as far as the leader may still participate in the duty.

If a party member's progress is beyond that of the leader, that member's progress will remain unaffected.
