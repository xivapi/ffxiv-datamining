The hosts may ring their eternity bells to proceed."

The hosts may ring their eternity bells to proceed."
1003,"The Reception
The hosts may ring their eternity bells to bring proceedings to a close."
1004,"The reception will conclude shortly."
1005,"Ladies and gentlemen—and any others who may not fall into said categories!"
1006,"I welcome you one and all to the Ceremony of Eternal Bonding, kupo!"
1007,"Let us watch in silent reverence as <Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A> and <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A> make their entrance into this most holy of halls."
1008,"Was that not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? It was the most beautiful thing <Emphasis>I've</Emphasis> ever seen—and I've seen a lot of these, kupo!"
1009,"If anything can top that entrance, it would probably be an emotional exchange of vows..."
1010,"If our lovely couple would be so kind as to approach the dais for the ring exchange..."
1011,"For what would a bonding ceremony be without a bond, er...band?"
1012,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> here has toiled day and night, night and day─give or take a few days and nights─to create a truly <Emphasis>unique</Emphasis> symbol of <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>his<Else/>her</If> devotion."
1013,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has called upon a trusted companion to craft the ring <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>he<Else/>she</If> brings today."
1014,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has traveled the realm in search of the perfect ring with which to express <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>his<Else/>her</If> devotion."
1015,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> brings with <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>him<Else/>her</If> a ring which is special in more ways than one."
1016,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1017,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1018,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1019,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1020,"Over hill and dale, across ocean and desert, through snowstorm and rain, over hill and...er..."
1021,"The point is, kupo: our couple journeyed many malms to earn the blessings of the Twelve, proving their resolve in so doing! "
1022,"And though the Sanctum somehow neglected to vest any official power in this humble choir moogle..."
1023,"I'll gladly pronounce the two of you bonded for all eternity, kupo!"
1024,"Come on, now─give them a nice round of applause! They've earned it, kupo!"
1025,"The remainder of your time in the chapel is yours to fill however you wish. Just be careful not to spill any beverages on the carpets because it'll be muggins here who has to scrub that out, kupo!"
1026,"I am pained to inform you that it is─as the jolly innkeepers put it─closing time."
1027,"You are, by no means, required to go home..."
1028,"Let us shower our good friends with joy, happiness, and inexpensive party goods─available from our own outfitters─as they step out of this blessed sanctuary and into their new lives!"
1029,"Welcome dear friends and loved ones."
1030,"We are gathered here today to join two kindred souls in holy union."
1031,"<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A> and <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>."
1032,"Here, in the presence of gods and men, they shall take a solemn oath to endure all future trials as one. Supporting the other, should they falter. Guiding the other, should they lose their way."
1033,"Therefore, this binding of two souls, which is commended to be honorable amongst all, must not be entered into lightly, but with sincerity and reverence."
1034,"While none may deny the spiritual bond 'twixt hearts intertwined, the gods do ask that a symbol be offered─a token to serve as a tangible reminder of the promise made."
1035,"Let us raise up these tokens of our couple's commitment, that the Twelve might pass judgment upon them."
1036,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─like the Builder Himself, you have embraced creation, and with thine own hands fashioned a ring the likes of which none have heretofore seen."
1037,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─Menphina teaches us that our worth is measured not only by the love we receive, but by the love we give. The ring you bring today serves as a testament to that love."
1038,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─as the Traders teach, our lives are an everlasting circle of exchange, not unlike the ring for which you have bartered."
1039,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─like the path of the Wanderer, some roads are more winding than first they appear. Such is the road your ring has taken."
1040,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─the Scholar provides us with such knowledge as would allow us to bend the world to our will. You have used this knowledge to create a ring most wondrous."
1041,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─the Warden embraces all truths, yet She values none more highly than the truth which two friends share. Verily, the ring you have brought today is a true symbol of friendship."
1042,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>. The Navigator guides us all unto that which we seek. Thus did you happen upon this ring."
1043,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>. As the Spinner weaves our fates, so too does She weave the fates of all creation. The ring you have brought for your partner was meant for this day from the first."
1044,"Though fraught with peril, the journey our couple embarked upon to see their rings blessed has brought them closer than they could e'er imagine."
1045,"Never will they forget the trials they overcame together. Never will they forget the bonds they forged."
1046,"By the power vested in me by the gods on high..."
1047,"I now pronounce you bonded for eternity!"
1048,"Now, dear friends, let us give the happy couple a warm round of applause!"
1049,"Please use your remaining time in the Ivory Chapel as you wish."
1050,"Plead as we might, the Keeper stalls the hands of time for no soul."
1051,"And so with this we must bring today's ceremony to a close."
1052,"A journey that will see <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> and <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> to places that they never imagined."
1053,"Greetings friends. Your presence at this joyous occasion is much appreciated."
1054,"Without further ado, let us see our couple to the dais."
1055,"Enter, <Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>."
1056,"Those gathered here today shall serve as witnesses to this sacred bond."
1057,"So that none may ever deny it."
1058,"And what tokens of loyalty and companionship do these two offer each other?"
1059,"What symbols of affection will they carry with them always in their hearts and on their hands?"
1060,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has toiled long to craft this flawless band."
1061,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> oversaw the creation of this flawless band."
1062,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has brought today this flawless band."
1063,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> presents this special ring and the untold history it carries."
1064,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has called upon <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> inner talents to forge <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> partner's ring."
1065,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has called upon a trusted companion to create <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> partner's ring."
1066,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has reached deep to procure <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> partner's ring."
1067,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has chosen this unique band for reasons known only to <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>he and his<Else/>she and her</If> partner alone."
1068,"The challenges our couple faced to prepare the rings for this day were not without peril."
1069,"Yet they overcame each and every obstacle hand in hand as one."
1070,"By the authority granted me by the Sanctum of the Twelve..."
1071,"I now pronounce you bonded for eternity."
1072,"Let us congratulate the newly bonded couple with a heartfelt round of applause."
1073,"The time remaining in the Ivory Chapel is your own. Feel free to celebrate this momentous occasion in any manner you see fit."
1074,"While I know none could wish the end of such a spectacular day..."
1075,"The Sanctum must ready its hallowed halls for another."
1076,"Now let us bid farewell to our friends as they set out not as two, but as one."
1077,"Have all preparations been completed?"
1078,"Yes"
1079,"No"
1080,"<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A> and <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>..."

1092,"Therefore, this bonding of two souls, which is commended to be honorable amongst all, must not be entered into lightly, but with sincerity and reverence."
1093,"So that none may ever deny it."
1094,"...which, as luck would have it, our couple has prepared for us all! You <Emphasis>have</Emphasis> prepared some...right?"
1095,"If there is any person here present who might show just cause as to why this couple should not be so joined, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. If there is none, then allow our couple to read aloud their prepared vows."
1096,"However, before we proceed to the exchanging of rings, I shall allow the couple a moment to read their vows."
1097,"...which I'm assuming you've prepared...right?"
1098,"As there are none here present who might show just cause as to why the two of you should not be bound unto one another, you may proceed to read aloud your prepared vows."
1099,"However, before we proceed to the exchanging of rings, I shall allow you a moment to read your vows."
1100,"If there is another like it in the entire realm, it is purely by coincidence!"
1101,"For <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s sake, let us hope <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>he<Else/>she</If> doesn't trust that companion <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> much, kupo!"
1102,"And by divine providence, they were not sold out, kupo!"
1103,"So special, in fact, that <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>he<Else/>she</If> wouldn't even tell me why, kupo!"
1104,"Crafted with <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> own two hands─each strike of the chaser hammer a declaration of everlasting faith, kupo!"
1105,"Crafted by a fellow adventurer under <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s strict supervision, kupo."
1106,"A dazzling specimen that could not have been easy to come by, kupo."
1107,"A ring whose deep personal significance is probably better explained by <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>him<Else/>her</If>self, kupo."
1108,"And of this token, the Twelve approve."

1124,"And so long as these symbols of your shared bond endure, none may deny the legitimacy of the rites performed here this day."
1125,"May they be reminded of that journey whenever they gaze upon these sacred bands. Or into each other's eyes. Or at a moogle, for that matter, kupo!"
1126,"And with that, all that remains now is to seal the pact..."
1127,"...with a kiss─amongst other things, kupo!"
1128,"With this exchange, these two souls shall pledge themselves to one another, and in the eyes of the Twelve be ever joined in one unbroken circle."
1129,"Now, <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> and <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>..."
1130,"Step forward and complete the rites of ring and cup."
1131,"You both made it through in one piece! And that's more than I can say for those bomb-happy goblins I presided over last week, kupo!"
1132,"You must feel a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders."
1133,"And allow me to be the first to offer my personal congratulations."
1134,"May they live happily ever after, kupo!"

2304,"Storm Castrum Lacus Litore."
2305,"Find a way to open the barricade."
2306,"Freed prisoners"
2307,"Clear the airship landing."
2308,"Clear Majesty's Auspice."
2309,"Combat functions compromised.
Abandoning warmachina."
2310,"The crack of lightning, the roar of flame,
The rumble of earth, the grip of ice,
The rush of water, the howl of wind.
At their center, I stand. Alone and omnipotent."
2311,"This is test subject VIII, Dabog.
Target sighted."
2312,"I need a good scrap to clear the cobwebs!"
2313,"Who will be next to fuel my flame?"
2314,"The tunnel armor is under attack!
Strike the enemy's core!"
2315,"Keep those helldivers away from the tunnel armor!"
2316,"It's beginning to crack!"
2317,"It's working! It's working!"
2318,"We're almost there! Just a little longer!"
2319,"I tire of your impudence. Now, I shall reduce you to ash, bones and all!"
2320,"What's that supposed to be!? A shameful display if ever I saw one."
2321,"Helldivers! We must guard the tunnel armor from them at all costs!"
2322,"More helldivers, coming in fast! Quickly, get rid of them!"
2323,"Operational time limit exceeded.
Firing all armaments."
2324,"Not another step closer! Time to show you what the IVth Legion's made of!"
2325,"Is there no end to them!?"
2326,"They've finally run out of soldiers to throw at us, it seems.
Forward!"
2327,"Careful now. Something's not right.
Be on your guard."
2328,"Our efforts will all be for naught if the tunnel armor fails now.
Do whatever it takes to defend it!"
2329,"Dawon! Are you enjoying this as much as I am?"

2408,"Extraordinary... To think such vast ruins could endure underground for all these years. I pray we can find Misija before it's too late."
2409,"Is that...!? Heavens forfend. Careful, everyone!"
2410,"I care not for this strange energy emanating from the floor..."
2411,"Have these creatures always lived down here, I wonder...? I wish we did not have to fight, but I fear they leave us little choice."
2412,"It would seem they are intent on blocking our path."
2413,"If they were placed here to protect Save the Queen, then Misija must be ahead. Quickly!"
2414,"Spirits!? Even in death they are denied solace... Let us lay them to rest!"
2415,"Have care where you step. I sense more foul magicks nearby."
2416,"Careful. There may yet be more traps here."
2417,"Another of the tempered Blades... Gods, what has Misija done?"
2418,"These ruins are endless. Where could she be?"
2419,"We are the Blades of the Verdant Path. Three who fight as one. All who trespass must be purged, in the name of the queen!"
2420,"The Verdant Path...? Then this amalgamation of aether I sense is... Oh no!"
2421,"Submit, that we might offer you a merciful end."
2422,"You would forego our mercy? Then suffer by our baleful blade!"
2423,"We shall break you with fists of iron!"
2424,"I... I recognize their─I mean, its aether. But how could this be?"
2425,"Before our blade, you are nothing."
2426,"It's too late for you!"
2427,"Hyah!"
2428,"A futile endeavor."
2429,"There is no need to fear the inevitable."
2430,"You have never seen a blade like <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>!"
2431,"Three...as one. Now and...forever...more..."
2432,"This is far worse than I feared. I have read of the prolonged effects of tempering, but a fusion of bodies and spirits...?"
2433,"Halt! By order of Queen Gunnhildr, the punishment for trespassing is death!"
2434,"Are they too under the influence of Save the Queen? I suppose we have no choice but to fight."
2435,"You shall perish long before our defenses are breached."
2436,"This does not bode well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We have to stop them!"
2437,"Fall back! Fall back! The queen cannot be left unguarded!"
2438,"Death to those who dare defy the queen. So it is decreed, and so it shall be!"
2439,"More souls made thrall to Misija and Queen Gunnhildr... Why did it come to this?"
2440,"A ruin of ice and fire upon thee!"
2441,"Its magicks have destabilized our thermoregulatory─ Ahem... We must return our body temperatures to normal."
2442,"You doubt our power!? Behold...!"
2443,"Perhaps these aetherial agglomerations can help us. If you feel overly hot or cold, seek one whose temperature is an opposing extremity."
2444,"Struggle if that is your wont, but our power shall not be denied!"
2445,"The queen's decree must needs be fulfilled! We will bathe this chamber in flames if we must!"
2446,"Bathed in flame!? Fall back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
2447,"I have you now!"
2448,"The aether of this chamber has grown erratic. Careful─those arrows are not what they seem."
2449,"Very well... Perhaps you would rather fall by our sword."
2450,"Its magicks have warped the blade somehow..."
2451,"No matter the cost, you must be dealt with."
2452,"Like animals to slaughter, we shall cut you down."
2453,"Surrender now and perhaps we will show mercy."
2454,"Let our magick become flesh, a redoubtable vessel to fulfill the queen's will!"
2455,"We...have failed... Our duty... Our queen..."
2456,"Hurry, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We must put an end to this. For their sakes..."
2457,"I am Gunnhildr... I am queen! Bozja is mine to rule, now and forevermore!"
2458,"She's become a vessel for the blades power... <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I'm afraid she must be slain. There is no other way."
2459,"Lady of blades, bring forth my betrayers. Purify their hearts, and return them to glory!"
2460,"Hearken now to the clarion call of war! The time for battle has come."
2461,"Prepare yourself, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. She compels them to march."
2462,"Lady of blades, I beseech you─grant me the strength to overcome our oppressors! To reclaim what is rightfully ours!"
2463,"As strange as this may sound, I suspect we must march as well if we mean to avoid coming to harm."
2464,"Come, my subjects. Protect your queen!"
2465,"エーテルを凝縮している……！？
障害となるテンパードたちを、排除しなければ……！"
2466,"Never again shall Bozja come to harm. I will not allow it!"
2467,"Mine is the just path. The <Emphasis>righteous</Emphasis> path! And I will not suffer a second betrayal!"
2468,"Are you all right, everyone?"
2469,"My word is law! My will is absolute!"
2470,"聖剣にエーテルが充填されています！
大技に警戒してください！"
2471,"To me, my subjects!"
2472,"Do not be fooled by his illusions! Look closely, and you will see the truth of their stratagems."
2473,"March, my subjects. Your queen commands it!"
2474,"Enough of this mummery."
2475,"Intruders! Get out! GET OUT!!!"
2476,"Die! Die! DIE!!!"
2477,"Why...won't...you..."
2478,"Who dares disturb our slumber?"
2479,"At last... Our souls...may rest..."
2480,"Intruders not welcome. Intruders leave. Or die!"
2481,"Graaagh! Not...welcome... Leave...or..."
2482,"Intruders suffer! Intruders despair!"
2483,"Curse intruders!"
