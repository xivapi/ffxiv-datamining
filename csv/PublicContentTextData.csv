The hosts may ring their eternity bells to bring proceedings to a close."
1004,"The reception will conclude shortly."
1005,"Ladies and gentlemen—and any others who may not fall into said categories!"
1006,"I welcome you one and all to the Ceremony of Eternal Bonding, kupo!"
1007,"Let us watch in silent reverence as <Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A> and <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A> make their entrance into this most holy of halls."
1008,"Was that not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? It was the most beautiful thing <Emphasis>I've</Emphasis> ever seen—and I've seen a lot of these, kupo!"
1009,"If anything can top that entrance, it would probably be an emotional exchange of vows..."
1010,"If our lovely couple would be so kind as to approach the dais for the ring exchange..."
1011,"For what would a bonding ceremony be without a bond, er...band?"
1012,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> here has toiled day and night, night and day─give or take a few days and nights─to create a truly <Emphasis>unique</Emphasis> symbol of <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>his<Else/>her</If> devotion."
1013,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has called upon a trusted companion to craft the ring <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>he<Else/>she</If> brings today."
1014,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has traveled the realm in search of the perfect ring with which to express <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>his<Else/>her</If> devotion."
1015,"Ahem! <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> brings with <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>him<Else/>her</If> a ring which is special in more ways than one."
1016,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1017,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1018,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1019,"And then we have <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s ring."
1020,"Over hill and dale, across ocean and desert, through snowstorm and rain, over hill and...er..."
1021,"The point is, kupo: our couple journeyed many malms to earn the blessings of the Twelve, proving their resolve in so doing! "
1022,"And though the Sanctum somehow neglected to vest any official power in this humble choir moogle..."
1023,"I'll gladly pronounce the two of you bonded for all eternity, kupo!"
1024,"Come on, now─give them a nice round of applause! They've earned it, kupo!"
1025,"The remainder of your time in the chapel is yours to fill however you wish. Just be careful not to spill any beverages on the carpets because it'll be muggins here who has to scrub that out, kupo!"
1026,"I am pained to inform you that it is─as the jolly innkeepers put it─closing time."
1027,"You are, by no means, required to go home..."
1028,"Let us shower our good friends with joy, happiness, and inexpensive party goods─available from our own outfitters─as they step out of this blessed sanctuary and into their new lives!"
1029,"Welcome dear friends and loved ones."
1030,"We are gathered here today to join two kindred souls in holy union."
1031,"<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A> and <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>."
1032,"Here, in the presence of gods and men, they shall take a solemn oath to endure all future trials as one. Supporting the other, should they falter. Guiding the other, should they lose their way."
1033,"Therefore, this binding of two souls, which is commended to be honorable amongst all, must not be entered into lightly, but with sincerity and reverence."
1034,"While none may deny the spiritual bond 'twixt hearts intertwined, the gods do ask that a symbol be offered─a token to serve as a tangible reminder of the promise made."
1035,"Let us raise up these tokens of our couple's commitment, that the Twelve might pass judgment upon them."
1036,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─like the Builder Himself, you have embraced creation, and with thine own hands fashioned a ring the likes of which none have heretofore seen."
1037,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─Menphina teaches us that our worth is measured not only by the love we receive, but by the love we give. The ring you bring today serves as a testament to that love."
1038,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─as the Traders teach, our lives are an everlasting circle of exchange, not unlike the ring for which you have bartered."
1039,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─like the path of the Wanderer, some roads are more winding than first they appear. Such is the road your ring has taken."
1040,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─the Scholar provides us with such knowledge as would allow us to bend the world to our will. You have used this knowledge to create a ring most wondrous."
1041,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>─the Warden embraces all truths, yet She values none more highly than the truth which two friends share. Verily, the ring you have brought today is a true symbol of friendship."
1042,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>. The Navigator guides us all unto that which we seek. Thus did you happen upon this ring."
1043,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>. As the Spinner weaves our fates, so too does She weave the fates of all creation. The ring you have brought for your partner was meant for this day from the first."
1044,"Though fraught with peril, the journey our couple embarked upon to see their rings blessed has brought them closer than they could e'er imagine."
1045,"Never will they forget the trials they overcame together. Never will they forget the bonds they forged."
1046,"By the power vested in me by the gods on high..."
1047,"I now pronounce you bonded for eternity!"
1048,"Now, dear friends, let us give the happy couple a warm round of applause!"
1049,"Please use your remaining time in the Ivory Chapel as you wish."
1050,"Plead as we might, the Keeper stalls the hands of time for no soul."
1051,"And so with this we must bring today's ceremony to a close."
1052,"A journey that will see <Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> and <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> to places that they never imagined."
1053,"Greetings friends. Your presence at this joyous occasion is much appreciated."
1054,"Without further ado, let us see our couple to the dais."
1055,"Enter, <Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>."
1056,"Those gathered here today shall serve as witnesses to this sacred bond."
1057,"So that none may ever deny it."
1058,"And what tokens of loyalty and companionship do these two offer each other?"
1059,"What symbols of affection will they carry with them always in their hearts and on their hands?"
1060,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has toiled long to craft this flawless band."
1061,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> oversaw the creation of this flawless band."
1062,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has brought today this flawless band."
1063,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> presents this special ring and the untold history it carries."
1064,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has called upon <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> inner talents to forge <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> partner's ring."
1065,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has called upon a trusted companion to create <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> partner's ring."
1066,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has reached deep to procure <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> partner's ring."
1067,"<Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> has chosen this unique band for reasons known only to <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>he and his<Else/>she and her</If> partner alone."
1068,"The challenges our couple faced to prepare the rings for this day were not without peril."
1069,"Yet they overcame each and every obstacle hand in hand as one."
1070,"By the authority granted me by the Sanctum of the Twelve..."
1071,"I now pronounce you bonded for eternity."
1072,"Let us congratulate the newly bonded couple with a heartfelt round of applause."
1073,"The time remaining in the Ivory Chapel is your own. Feel free to celebrate this momentous occasion in any manner you see fit."
1074,"While I know none could wish the end of such a spectacular day..."
1075,"The Sanctum must ready its hallowed halls for another."
1076,"Now let us bid farewell to our friends as they set out not as two, but as one."
1077,"Have all preparations been completed?"
1078,"Yes"
1079,"No"
1080,"<Unknown0A>E802</Unknown0A> and <Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>..."

1092,"Therefore, this bonding of two souls, which is commended to be honorable amongst all, must not be entered into lightly, but with sincerity and reverence."
1093,"So that none may ever deny it."
1094,"...which, as luck would have it, our couple has prepared for us all! You <Emphasis>have</Emphasis> prepared some...right?"
1095,"If there is any person here present who might show just cause as to why this couple should not be so joined, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. If there is none, then allow our couple to read aloud their prepared vows."
1096,"However, before we proceed to the exchanging of rings, I shall allow the couple a moment to read their vows."
1097,"...which I'm assuming you've prepared...right?"
1098,"As there are none here present who might show just cause as to why the two of you should not be bound unto one another, you may proceed to read aloud your prepared vows."

1102,"And by divine providence, they were not sold out, kupo!"
1103,"So special, in fact, that <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(3),0))>he<Else/>she</If> wouldn't even tell me why, kupo!"
1104,"Crafted with <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>his<Else/>her</If> own two hands─each strike of the chaser hammer a declaration of everlasting faith, kupo!"
1105,"Crafted by a fellow adventurer under <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/>'s strict supervision, kupo."
1106,"A dazzling specimen that could not have been easy to come by, kupo."
1107,"A ring whose deep personal significance is probably better explained by <Split(<Unknown0A>E803</Unknown0A>, ,1)/> <If(Equal(IntegerParameter(4),0))>him<Else/>her</If>self, kupo."
1108,"And of this token, the Twelve approve."

1123,"And with it pledges conviction unending."
1124,"And so long as these symbols of your shared bond endure, none may deny the legitimacy of the rites performed here this day."
1125,"May they be reminded of that journey whenever they gaze upon these sacred bands. Or into each other's eyes. Or at a moogle, for that matter, kupo!"
1126,"And with that, all that remains now is to seal the pact..."
1127,"...with a kiss─amongst other things, kupo!"
1128,"With this exchange, these two souls shall pledge themselves to one another, and in the eyes of the Twelve be ever joined in one unbroken circle."

1133,"And allow me to be the first to offer my personal congratulations."

1141,"I hope to see neither of you again...if you know what I mean, kupo!"

We'll need to get past that barricade."

They're likely being held somewhere in the castrum."

2296,"Someone's there! Wait, is that...?"
2297,"You fools...what have you done? Gabranth would see Bozja reborn, yet you would bare your steel against him!?"
2298,"By denying the path of righteousness, you have sealed your fate.
The heavens have spoken, and they are wroth indeed!"

Now know regret, a sinner's recompense."

Forward!"

Be on your guard."
