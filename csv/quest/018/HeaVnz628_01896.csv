1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ628_01896_SEQ_01","Luciae is waiting for supplies from Ishgard, but a nearby nest of archaeornis is waylaying any caravan that attempts the journey. Thin the brood's numbers by slaying at least three grand archaeornis so that the goods can be transported safely."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ628_01896_SEQ_02","You have slain three of the grandest archaeornis that you could find, hopefully reducing their numbers enough for any caravans to pass by unmolested. Report to Luciae with the good news."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ628_01896_SEQ_03","You inform Luciae of your success. Glad that the route is no longer at risk of attack, she sets about convincing the Ishgardian merchants of its safety."
