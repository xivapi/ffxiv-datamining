1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ502_01837_SEQ_01","It seems that Mogret is fretting over some flowers that are in danger of wilting before her very eyes, but she cannot water them due to the hropken that has moved into her favorite spring. Go to Eil Tohm and slay the inconsiderate hropken, then fill the empty ewer Mogret gave you with water for the flowers."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ502_01837_SEQ_02","The hropken will no longer be a problem for the moogles of Moghome, and the once-empty ewer is now filled with sparkling spring water. Bring it to Mogret before her flowers wilt away into nothing."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ502_01837_SEQ_03","Mogret is ecstatic that her flowers will be able to bloom even further. It seems the increase in dragons is a recent phenomena, and Mogret seems convinced that they have only come to give the moogles a hard time."
