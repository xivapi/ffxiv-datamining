1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_01","The thoroughness of Mogleo's search for those in need surprises you once again, for he has somehow found another distressed moogle quite far from any established settlement. Mogleo looks eager to help, and it falls once again upon you to strike up conversation and find out what troubles this particular moogle."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_02","The poor moogle at Zenith has perhaps the most heartbreaking story yet. It seems that dragons have overrun the flower bed he had been so dutifully caring over, and drove him away when he attempted to impart onto them the flowers' importance. Now, the moogle is trapped at Zenith with no way to return to Asah because the road is blocked by the selfsame dragons that invaded his flower bed. Mogleo, seeing an opportunity to help yet another desperate moogle, volunteers his protection while the heartbroken moogle makes his way home. Speak with Mogleo again, who wants to discuss the battle strategy of this next adventure with you."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_03","Mogleo seems determined to take on this task alone, but also states that in the case of an actual dragon attack, your assistance would be more than welcome. Follow Mogleo and the troubled moogle as they make their way to Asah so that you may see Mogleo's courageous display of moogle strength."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_04","Much to the surprise of no one at all, you find Mogleo and his charge cowering in fear before an enraged dragon. Save the moogles before they become the dragon's next meal."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_05","Mogleo and the worried moogle are grateful for your rescue, and promptly continue down the road to Asah. Follow them to make sure they do not fall prey to any more of the Churning Mists' hungry dragons."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_06","Once again, you arrive to find the two moogles in a difficult situation involving dragons. Intervene before their journey to Asah is cut prematurely short."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_07","After you rescue the two frightened moogles, Mogleo claims that he was close to felling the dragon himself before continuing on the path towards Asah. Whether or not his boasting is true, follow the moogles to guarantee their safe arrival."
8,"TEXT_HEAVNZ413_01831_SEQ_08","The two moogles have arrived safely at Asah, but Mogleo is ashamed that he was not able to dispatch the dragons himself. However, with the encouragement of the moogle he guided to Asah, he resolves to continue helping moogles until he finds the courage to overcome his fear himself."
