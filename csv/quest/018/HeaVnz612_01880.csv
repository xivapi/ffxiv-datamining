1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ612_01880_SEQ_01","Maenne informs you that she was attacked suddenly while investigating the lower layer of the Rookery by a type of dragon she has never seen before. She worries that leaving the beast be will only result in more injured dragoons, and bids you slay it before any more come to harm. She also asks that you bring something from that battle that might help identify the true nature of such a dragon. Make your way to the lower layer of the Rookery and slay the dragon if you find it."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ612_01880_SEQ_02","You encounter the enormous dragon and slay it after a violent struggle, recovering a piece of ancient and rusty armor from its corpse. Give the armor to Maenne to see if she can glean any knowledge from it."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ612_01880_SEQ_03","After examining the piece of armor you present to her, Maenne declares that it was forged in Ishgard, and most likely dates back to hundreds of years ago. It seems the dragon you slew was once a heretic, his monstrous form resulting from overindulging in dragon blood. Maenne cannot understand the heretic's motivations, and wonders why anyone would choose to be transformed in such a way."
