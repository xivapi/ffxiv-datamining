1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ601_01869_SEQ_01","Mathye received an order from Saint Endalim's Scholasticate, his most esteemed client, but has lost record of what they requested. All he can recall is they are missing a volume from the <Emphasis>Seventy-two Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis>. He asks that you go to the scholasticate and ask around to figure out which volume they require."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ601_01869_SEQ_02","You arrive at the scholasticate and have a look around. You find a shelf listing volumes one through nine, but volumes four and six seem to be missing. Looking on another shelf you find volume six. You also notice volume ten lying on one of the tables. A young seminarian named Theomocent tells you he is studying volumes twelve and thirteen, while Archombadin tells you of his work with volume fourteen in a condescending tone. The student standing outside, Leigh, tells you he borrowed a volume from the scholasticate, but he has forgotten which one. After speaking with Janchette, however, you learn that Leigh has borrowed volume four but is too busy to study its contents. Report to Mathye and tell him what you have learned."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ601_01869_SEQ_03","Your astute observations reveal that the scholasticate is lacking for volume eleven. Thanks to your keen eye, Mathye can go on to sell his wares another day. "

Well, your timing couldn't be better. It would seem I have misplaced the record of sales for my most esteemed client: Saint Endalim's Scholasticate."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ601_01869_MATHYE_000_002","Surely you can imagine how embarrassing it would be were I to ask them again myself, and they to learn the reason why. That's why I need you to go in my stead. No need for overt inquiries, mind. Just make small talk and surreptitiously examine the shelves to see what might be missing."

56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ601_01869_THEOMOCENT_000_031","The subject matter is quite dense─hardly something that could be handled in a single sitting. If you have need, I could bear to part with them for a short while."

65,"TEXT_HEAVNZ601_01869_JANCHETTE_000_031","In truth, these books are all rather dense, especially after the eleventh volume. You must memorize the teachings of the fourth to set a foundation for everything that follows."
66,"TEXT_HEAVNZ601_01869_JANCHETTE_000_032","Leigh was the last to borrow it as far as I know, but he's been so busy of late. Something about helping children being bullied. If he is truly so busy, I wish he would at least return the book to us."
