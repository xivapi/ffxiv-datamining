51,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_ALPHINAUD_000_012","...I would appreciate it, of course, if you could share any discoveries with me in turn. We should both learn as much as possible about our, ahem, “new place of residence.”"

55,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_000_032","He was escorting me on a shopping errand when I realized I'd dropped my handkerchief. And now I've been waiting here all alone while he's been off searching for it."

79,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_000_084","Oh, my attitude is naught unusual, I assure you. Without the efforts of our bonded residents, we free citizens would not enjoy the pleasures of our daily lives. They are deserving of our unending gratitude."

81,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_000_086","Mayhap in another society, our different standing would breed prejudice or resentment. But in Eulmore, a most glorious measure is in place to avert such unpleasantness."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_000_087","Part of that measure requires that the free surrender their fortunes. Upon registration, all of our property─financial, intellectual, or otherwise─is given over to the city."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_100_087","In exchange, we are provided with ample funds and commodities to live a life of pampered luxury."

85,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_000_089","Now, if you'll excuse us, I must see what the markets have to offer as a reward for the return of my handkerchief. Oh, and I've not forgotten you, of course, our courageous messenger-turned-rescuer!"
