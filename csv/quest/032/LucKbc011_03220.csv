1,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_01","No sooner do you set foot in the manufactory when Stephanivien makes a sudden request. It would seem that Joye is once again slipping away on mysterious outings and acting in a generally suspicious manner. Concerned for her well-being, Stephanivien sends you out to Saint Reinette's Forum to observe his right-hand woman's behavior. Discreetly, of course."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_02","After witnessing an obviously planned meeting between Joye and Hilda, you are approached by Ser Muscadain. According to the Temple Knight, the unlikely pair has been seen making trips together to Falcon's Nest. Stephanivien will wish to hear of this..."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_03","You make your report to Stephanivien, and the manufactory chief's surprise quickly turns to confused curiosity. Unable to make sense of the pairing or the destination, Stephanivien proposes a trip to Falcon's Nest for a spot of good old-fashioned reconnaissance."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_04","Within moments, Stephanivien has gathered enough information to point the two of you in the direction of the Black Iron Bridge. It seems Joye and Hilda's expeditions often take them out into the snow-covered wilds..."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_05","The sound of shots ringing in the air leads you right to where Joye and Hilda are attempting─albeit unsuccessfully─to develop new machinist techniques. Not wishing to disrespect their struggle for independent learning, Stephanivien elects to support their efforts indirectly. After some discussion, it is decided that you will inspire them with a <Emphasis>completely coincidental</Emphasis> demonstration of skill─a proposal which has you waiting at a spot nearby whilst Stephanivien herds towards you a suitably monstrous opponent."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_06","You have defeated the charging brute with the appropriate panache. Rendezvous with Stephanivien back near the Black Iron Bridge."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_07","You rejoin Stephanivien by the bridge, and he commends you on your masterful performance before urging a swift return to the manufactory. Your work here is done."
8,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_SEQ_08","Even as Stephanivien praises you again for a job well done, Joye and Hilda make their entrance. It soon becomes clear that your attempts to provide subtle assistance were not quite as subtle as you believed. Despite their exasperation, however, the two ladies are nonetheless grateful for the nudge in the right direction. Joye and Hilda give their thanks and take their leave, promising to carry on the evolution of the machinist profession. Once more have your remarkable deeds proven the unerring accuracy of Stephanivien's internal prospectometer."

49,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_001","'Tis our faithful Joye who concerns me. Her behavior has been awfully odd of late─frequent outings to parts unknown, acting secretive, that sort of thing."
50,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_002","It reminds me of the time her father was being held captive, and I worry that she once more finds herself the victim of nefarious circumstances."
51,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_003","That is, as they say, where you come in. An adventurer and machinist of your caliber should have little trouble discerning the severity of her situation. Discreetly, of course!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_004","I would make a few subtle inquiries myself, but I fear that Joye, her senses on edge as they are, would soon detect the attempt..."
53,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_005","Ahem. As fortune would have it, she only just left on one of her mysterious outings. You should be able to catch her in the vicinity of Saint Reinette's Forum if you leave immediately!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_010","Cast your eye over Saint Reinette's Forum, and see if you cannot locate Joye─or failing that, a hint as to the truth of her predicament."
55,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_HILDA_000_020","(-???-)Sorry, Joye, hope I didn't keep you waitin' too long."

77,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_HILDA_000_303","We've always had an instructor before, showin' us the way. Not surprisin' we'd stumble a bit tryin' to come up with stuff on our own."

79,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_HILDA_000_305","That'd defeat the purpose then, wouldn't it? If we're to stand on our own two feet, then we need to work this out ourselves."

82,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_JOYE_000_308","No time for questions, Hilda! Your breath'd be better spent searchin' for new things to shoot!"
83,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_310","'Twas I who dreamed up the machinists, and Rostnsthal who helped bring the idea into being. The machine we put together, well that was driven forward by the likes of you and Joye and Hilda."
84,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_311","Then as naturally as if I had planned it, you and those two ladies took charge of my designs..."
85,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_312","Heh, 'tis a strange feeling. How wildly the needle flicks 'twixt a mentor's pride and an inventor's longing."
86,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_313","'Twould seem, however, that our comrades are experiencing some difficulties with the particulars of developing new techniques. A problem to which we might offer a solution!"

91,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_320","A little creative push, you think? That could certainly help break them out of the slump they find themselves in... But how exactly to provide that inspiration?"
92,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_330","Give them an example of what is possible? A fine proposal. But what exactly shall we put on display?"
93,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_340","But of course! The answer stands right there in front of me! You stand at the peak of the profession─the living embodiment of all it means to be a machinist!"
94,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_341","All we need do is have you demonstrate the techniques you have acquired and refined over the course of your illustrious career. What could possibly be more inspiring!?"

100,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_STEPHANIVIEN_000_370","Nicely done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I am truly in awe of what you can accomplish with my contraptions! Tell me, where did you learn such control and power!?"
101,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
102,"TEXT_LUCKBC011_03220_A2_000_001","I journeyed through a land without night..."
