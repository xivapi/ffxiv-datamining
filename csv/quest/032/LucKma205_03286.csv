1,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_01","With Tristol's brush in hand, Alphinaud lays out his plan to gain entry to Eulmore: he will pose as a painter, and you will play the role of his faithful assistant. Thus resolved, you depart for Gatetown, hoping that the manic jesters will soon return in search of a replacement artist..."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_02","After a short wait, your patience is rewarded. As predicted, the jongleurs emerge to recruit a new artist, and Alphinaud's act proves sufficiently convincing to earn you both an invitation into Eulmore."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_03","As nonchalantly as you can, you pass through the gates, and take in the sights and sounds of the city. The red-garbed jester stands near the entrance, waiting to provide you with further instructions."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_04","You listen carefully as your smirking guide explains the process by which Eulmoran citizenship is obtained. It seems your first step is to present yourself to the clerk at the Bureau of Immigration."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_05","After describing the basics of Eulmoran society and your place within it, the immigration officer hands you a set of registration papers. You are to deliver them to the neighboring Bureau of Registration, where your status as citizens will be officially approved."
6,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_06","The registration officer soon approves your papers, but takes offense at your bodily odor. You are duly supplied with a bottle of perfume, and ushered next door to the Delousery, where you are expected to make thorough use of the bathing facilities."
7,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_07","You emerge from the shower, clean and refreshed. According to the clerk's instructions, you are now required to apply liberal quantities of the sweet-smelling perfume previously provided..."
8,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_08","You dutifully splash yourself with the liquid, and the delicate scent of roses fills your nostrils. Lovely. As for Alphinaud, it appears he has yet to enter the Delousery..."
9,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_09","After some encouragement, Alphinaud overcomes his bashfulness and plunges into the showers for a quick wash, emerging a short while later in a cloud of perfume. Now that you both smell as if you've wrestled in a flower bed instead of a drainage ditch, you are free to trouble Cornenne for directions to the Chai residence."
10,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_10","Cornenne gives you an overview of the city's layout and tells you where to find your new patrons. It seems your path leads up the steps to the Canopy, and thence into the Grand Dame's Parlor."
11,"TEXT_LUCKMA205_03286_SEQ_11","Despite some initial suspicion on Chai-Nuzz's part, you─and especially Alphinaud─appear to have made a favorable impression on the effusive Dulia-Chai, cementing your place in the city. At last, Eulmore's mysteries are yours to explore..."
