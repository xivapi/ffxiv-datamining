1,"TEXT_LUCKBC005_03214_SEQ_01","The rumors of your recent trials have had Jehantel worried for you, and apparently he isn't the only one. The old bard invites you to accompany him to New Gridania, there to meet your friend Captain Sanson Smyth and set his mind at ease."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBC005_03214_SEQ_02","After expressing his delight at seeing you again, Sanson informs you that he and his unit also took to battle at the Ghimlyt Dark. However, the relatively inexperienced bards struggled with their songs when they were hard-pressed. With Guydelot unwilling to instruct his juniors, Jehantel suggests that the two of you put on a performance for them, that they might experience a song brimming with heart. It is decided that Guydelot will also take part, and you set out to find him in Nine Ivies in the East Shroud."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBC005_03214_SEQ_03","According to Pukno Poki, Guydelot has ventured deep into the woods. Believing that the willful bard is most likely to respond to you, Jehantel bids you call out to him.

5,"TEXT_LUCKBC005_03214_SEQ_05","At last, Guydelot reveals himself, and you inform him of the performance. The bard agrees on account of the rare opportunity to perform with you, and the stage is set for the Sea of Clouds. Sanson instructs you to gather at the airship landing in Gridania while he seeks his superiors' permission to use a vessel."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBC005_03214_SEQ_06","With the airship secured, your party sets out for the Sea of Clouds, to the place where your journey for the Ballad of Oblivion reached its end. With the heavens as your backdrop, you give a heartfelt performance of a piece written by Jehantel and inspired by your own adventures. The song moves your small audience nigh to tears, helping the recruits to understand that which is most important to a bard. Its lesson also moves Sanson to try to better understand Guydelot, and he convinces his friend to guide his juniors in his own time."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBC005_03214_SEQ_07","Back at the airship landing, Sanson reiterates his desire to help his men become the best bards they can be, before running off in pursuit of the ever free-spirited Guydelot. This leaves you alone with Jehantel, who thanks you for the sublime experience of performing with you. The song, born of your collaboration, woke memories of the passion he had in his youth. And generations hence, your erstwhile mentor believes, it will still be sung, awakening passion in countless more souls."
