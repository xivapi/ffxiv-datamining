1,"TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_01","Gridania is the next stop on Troupe Falsiam's itinerary, yet Nashmeira has a suspicion that troubling events of the sort you bore witness to in Ul'dah might be plaguing your next destination as well. Upon your arrival in the Twelveswood, first make your way to the Adders' Nest, that you and Nashmeira might glean helpful information about any recent happenings."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_02","Mistress Nashmeira's portentous premonitions prove true, as Lieutenant Gavin of the Twin Adders gravely informs you that Duskwight malcontents have been openly planning violent uprisings just outside Gridania's borders. Convinced that she must see what is happening with her own eyes, Nashmeira succeeds─with your support─in convincing the officer to allow Troupe Falsiam to investigate the matter. Accompany your companions to the local watering hole and gather what information you can."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_03","Rumor has it Duskwight troublemakers have been sighted in the area performing odd dances. It is becoming increasingly clear that the similarity to the events in Ul'dah are more than a coincidence─and that Mistress Nashmeira knows more than she is letting on. Make for the Upper Paths and keep lookout for any suspicious personages."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_04","Upon being confronted by seemingly mad Duskwights, Mistress Nashmeira suddenly performs a curious dance, causing eerie clouds of dark aether to emerge from within their bodies. Defeat them and cast out the shadow!"
5,"TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_05","Wielding your dancing abilities and martial skills both, you succeed in freeing the stricken Duskwights from the darkness that plagued their hearts. Unfortunately, it would seem Nashmeira was wounded in battle. Ranaa quickly rushes to her teacher's side to examine her wounds, and you decide to join her."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_06","The battle won, you take a moment to reflect and recuperate with your fellow members of Troupe Falsiam. At Ranaa's request, you agree to return to the Adders' Nest to report your experiences while she tends to Mistress Nashmeira's wounds."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_07","Having at last confirmed matters with her own eyes, Mistress Nashmeira finally reveals to you the truth of the matter. What you have witnessed in Ul'dah and Gridania is none other than a phenomenon called the Totentanz, described ominously as the dance of the damned. As the Troupe Falsiam principal tells it, it is an aetheric manifestation that both arises from and feeds on the anger and fear in people's hearts, spreading across the land, taking over bodies and minds, and forcing unfortunate souls to perform a violent dance that often ends in their (and others') demise. She further explains that it is Troupe Falsiam's mission to wield the Kriegstanz to deliver the people of Eorzea from this menace, as her forebears have done time and again throughout history. Your calling as a dancer now crystal clear, you vow to redouble your training efforts, that you might be fully prepared for the confrontation that lies ahead.

※The next dancer quest will be available from Nashmeira upon reaching level 68."
