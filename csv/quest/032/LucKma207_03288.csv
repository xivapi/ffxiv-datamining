62,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_045","“High or Low” is a guessing game. You must decide whether the total of your three cards is higher or lower than the total of your opponent's cards."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_046","The deck holds nine cards, with the pictures printed thereon representing the numbers one through nine. Each number appears only once in the deck, so there are no repeats."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_047","If you guess correctly, then you win the match. If both totals are the same, then another hand is dealt."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_048","Oh? Well, you know where to find me if you want to play a hand or two."

90,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_077","In my humble estimation, the most wondrous thing about this town is how safe we are from the sin eaters."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_078","They say Lord Vauthry was born with the power to command them─which means no Eulmoran need ever raise a weapon in defense of the city."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_079","...Was that the kind of thing you wished to know? If your itch still needs scratching, you might get a few words out of Atharn over there. There's naught that merry sot likes more than the sound of his own voice."

94,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_081","Gahaha! Only just arrived and already you're looking to peel away the layers of mystery. Oh, I'm all for chatting, but you need to slow down and <Emphasis>enjoy</Emphasis> life, my friend!"

98,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_110","<whistle> Now <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> was a show! You're welcome to clamber up on stage any time you like!"
99,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_111","So...what was it you wanted to ask me? Ah, yes, something about our fair city. Well, I can tell you it wasn't always so peaceful as it is today."
100,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_112","The Eulmoran Army may be the very essence of military might, but even our forces saw grievous losses in the war against the sin eaters."
101,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_113","Things changed for us, oh, around twenty years ago now, when the old ruler's son came to power!"
102,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_114","He's got this way with the eaters, you see─turns them docile as house cats. I wouldn't be exaggerating to say they've become something of an ally to Eulmore. No longer an enemy to be feared."
103,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_115","And yet elsewhere, there are still fools who insist on fighting their losing battles... Pah! A toast to Lord Vauthry!"
104,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_SYSTEM_000_116","You've gained a preliminary sense of the city. The Chais─and Alphinaud─will be expecting your return."
105,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_120","Hm...? Ah, yes, the assistant. Was there something?"
106,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_130","Oh, you've returned from your jaunt around the city? So soon?"
107,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_131","You needn't have hurried back─young Alphinaud has yet to put brush to canvas."
108,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_132","One cannot rush good art, I'm told. Or good artists, apparently..."
109,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_133","...Ah, finally."
110,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ALPHINAUD_000_134","I've put together an ensemble out of the garments you chose. Is this satisfactory?"
111,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_135","Oh, goodness gracious me! That last outfit was precious, but this makes you look positively dashing!"
112,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_136","You truly are a handsome boy! However am I to decide!?"
113,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_Q3_000_137","What will you say?"
114,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_A3_000_138","What happened to painting?"
115,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_A3_000_139","I don't recall this part of the artistic process..."
116,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_140","Exactly! The lad is an artist, dearest, not a dress-up doll. It's about time we set him to work for the reason we called him here!"
117,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_141","...Must we? I do love a good painting, but I thought since we were enjoying ourselves so thoroughly..."
118,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_142","Well, I'd not─ That is to say, as long as you..."
119,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_143","Ugh. Just...make sure you give the lad time to prepare. We know who'll be upset if he's not ready to paint at a moment's notice."
120,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_144","Whatever you say, darling. So! Shall we pick out some jewelry, next!?"
