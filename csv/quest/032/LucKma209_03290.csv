1,"TEXT_LUCKMA209_03290_SEQ_01","Alphinaud's contemplation of your findings is interrupted by an angry Chai-Nuzz, whose admonishing words are cut short in turn by a sudden scream from above. The jongleurs duly appear to explain matters, declaring that a “villain” is to be sentenced by Lord Vauthry, and that everyone is invited to attend the event. Your patrons give you leave to witness the proceedings, directing you to a lift which should convey you to the Offer."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMA209_03290_SEQ_02","You ascend to the Offer, and are shocked to find Kai-Shirr lying bleeding in the middle of the floor. Aghast at the youth's barbaric punishment, Alphinaud confronts Lord Vauthry, sending him into a fit of rage. Your welcome thus outstayed, you take to your heels with Kai-Shirr in tow, and depart for the relative safety of the Derelicts."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMA209_03290_SEQ_03","Still fuming at Lord Vauthry's cruelty, Alphinaud says his farewells to Kai-Shirr and the Chais. He promises to return, but for now, it is time to find an amaro and leave Kholusia behind."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMA209_03290_SEQ_04","You reach the beach where the amaro have been patiently waiting to bear you back to the Crystarium. Alphinaud declares that it is time to speak with the Exarch, that you might chart a new course."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMA209_03290_SEQ_05","From what you have learned of Lord Vauthry and his subjects, it is plain that the city will not assist in your efforts to battle the sin eaters. In fact, any organized aggression towards the abominations is like to earn you Eulmore's enmity..."
