1,"TEXT_LUCKBA241_03271_SEQ_01","Reading between the lines, you understand that somehow, miraculously, Giott has regained access to the Cabinet of Curiosity─though the volumes within have been of little help in ascertaining the nature of the Ronkan magic Lamitt pursued. Dwarven records, on the other hand, have apparently yielded a useful hint as to the whereabouts of Lamitt's sister at the time of her travels. Your compatriot gives no further details, instead inviting you to visit the dwarven village of Tomra to see for yourself."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA241_03271_SEQ_02","You gain access to Tomra via the Ladder─which, judging by the dwarf's comportment upon your arrival, is as much a surprise to Giott as anyone. Before you can ask for more details as to the purpose of your visit, however, your overeager companion rushes off deeper into the village."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA241_03271_SEQ_03","Upon locating Giott once again, you find the dwarf poised over the still form of a defeated sin eater, which allegedly attacked when released from nearby tunnels. As Giott explains, said tunnels once served as a quarantine of sorts for those dwarves afflicted with stoneblight─a highly contagious illness that would turn flesh to stone and, at the time, had no cure. You then experience another vision, which confirms that Lamitt did, in fact, eventually succeed in curing her sister and others with the sickness─only to find herself met with scorn and banished from the village for having dared to break her people's taboos. Ever calm in the face of adversity, Lamitt accepted her punishment over Ardbert's protestations. Removing her dwarven helm once and for all, she─joined by her erstwhile patients─left her home, never to return."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA241_03271_SEQ_04","Though the helm obscures Giott's face, the dwarf's tone makes it clear that this latest revelation has come as something of a blow. Time to process the story you relayed may help─though you know all too well that the weight of some truths never quite leaves one's shoulders.

※The next role quest will be available from Giott upon reaching level 80 in any healer class."
