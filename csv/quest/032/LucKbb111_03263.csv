1,"TEXT_LUCKBB111_03263_SEQ_01","Sophie and Radovan's search for the next client has borne fruit, although they have yet to ascertain the nature of the assignment. A woman named Oriel has asked that you meet her near the Gate of Thal to discuss the details."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBB111_03263_SEQ_02","Oriel and her son, Timm, are in need of protection from her estranged husband, Gerrart, who persists in harassing the young mother. As he is in the habit of surprising her in locations where he is unlikely to be seen, Oriel suggests luring him outside of the city walls and catching him by surprise. You and Radovan accept the task of waiting for Gerrart to accost her before sending him scurrying with his tail between his legs."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBB111_03263_SEQ_03","Outside of the Gate of Thal, Gerrart appears from nowhere to bother Oriel, exactly as she had predicted. Radovan, deciding that he has seen enough, makes his presence known, and states in no uncertain terms that Gerrart should leave his wife and child in peace or face the consequences. The man is soon cowed and beats a hasty retreat, leaving Oriel to congratulate you all on a job well done before saying her farewells. Sophie, however, cannot escape the feeling that something is amiss, and urges you to go after Oriel."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBB111_03263_SEQ_04","Following Sophie's hunch, you find Oriel in conversation with two thoroughly suspicious characters, and it soon becomes clear she intends to sell her own child into slavery. It is at this very moment that Gerrart appears, although his attempt to rescue his son is swiftly thwarted. Just as Radovan prepares to burst forth and save him, he finds himself racked with pain and totally immobilized. The slavers have every intention of silencing the witness to their foul deeds, and only you and Sophie are in any position to stop them."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBB111_03263_SEQ_05","The two slave traders never stood a chance against your gunblade, and the immediate danger has been averted. Gerrart's reckless charge at two armed men ended with him being sent sprawling, and he is fortunate to have escaped with only minor injuries. Now that he has recovered somewhat, you decide to press him for an explanation on how this sorry incident came to pass."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBB111_03263_SEQ_06","Gerrart reveals that as a result of his gambling and ever-increasing debt, Oriel left him to seek a new life, taking their infant son with her. She quickly became entangled with members of Ul'dah's dark underbelly, and turned to somnus as a means of numbing herself to the misery that had consumed her. Meanwhile, Gerrart had made an earnest attempt to put his vices behind him and had secured a steady income. When he felt ready to face Oriel, he found that she had fallen into dire straits, placing the blame entirely upon himself. Gerrart intends to use the money he has saved to send Oriel to Frondale's Phrontistery for the treatment she needs, while he takes custody of Timm. Although there is no certainty that his wife will ever return to her former self, Gerrart is determined to salvage what he can from the wreckage of his broken family.

Radovan is not entirely satisfied with the outcome of the day's events, and offers an apology for once again making a burden of himself. He explains that he still suffers the aftereffects of the electric shocks administered by Garlean gaol wardens while he was incarcerated for insubordination. Radovan had spent ten years secretly digging a tunnel in an attempt to escape, only to find himself bursting through the wall of Sophie's cell. Making their way outside of the gates in the commotion that followed, they ran until they were beyond the reach of the Empire. Wishing to continue their journey through Eorzea, Sophie and Radovan suggest moving on to Limsa Lominsa in search of new prospects."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBB111_03263_SEQ_07","Once again, Radovan and Sophie have introduced themselves to the local Adventurers' Guild. While there are no jobs suitable for your group at present, it is only a matter of time before someone has need of a gunbreaker or two.

※The next gunbreaker quest will be available from Radovan upon reaching level 65."
