0,"TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_00","Nonotta is practically champing at the bit to see you dressed in your new Hatching–tide outfit.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_01","Nonotta and Riggy have prepared a complex conundrum for you and Jihli to solve as part of Hatching–tide. Nonotta also insists that you don the jacket she has designed especially for the event─which upon closer inspection you notice features an enormous hood complete with long, dangling attachments modeled after a spriggan's ears. It seems you will need to be attired to her satisfaction before she will allow you to begin the egg hunt.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_02","Clothed as Nonotta instructed, you submit yourself for her inspection. Though no explanation as to the supposed necessity of the garment is forthcoming, it at least serves the function of delighting her. She bids you go forth in search of three spriggans, who between them hold the key to unlocking the mystery she and Riggy have devised."
3,"TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_03","Scouring the various nooks and crannies of New Gridania, you eventually locate the three spriggans, who are quick to give up their clues. They eagerly offer brief statements relating to the numbers one, two, and three, the meaning of which is for the most part unclear at this point. Meanwhile, Jihli stares intently at the map that Nonotta has provided, in the hope that the information you have gathered will help solve the Hatching–tide puzzle."
4,"TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_04","Now that the necessary pieces are ostensibly in place, Nonotta divulges the password─Egg Hunt─which presumably will lead you to the gilded tourmaline egg when uttered in the correct location. Whether you and Jihli are able to find the place in question is another matter, as the small problem of unraveling the many-layered enigma yet remains."
5,"TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_05","You cleverly deduce that Mother Miounne is the one charged with safeguarding the gilded tourmaline egg, and she relinquishes your prize as per her agreement with Nonotta. The item in question is rather colorful, and a slight rustling sound comes from inside when it is shaken. You and Jihli decide that rather than quibbling over the object's true nature, you should return it to Nonotta and Riggy and put their puzzle to bed."
6,"TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_06","Nonotta praises you and Jihli for having overcome the challenge she had posed, or at least the first part of it. She wastes no time in revealing that this was merely a precursor, and the true conundrum is yet to come. The source of the rustling from inside the gilded tourmaline egg turns out to be another map, filling Jihli with a great sense of apprehension that her cognitive abilities will be pushed to their limits and beyond. Only time will tell if yours are up to the task."
