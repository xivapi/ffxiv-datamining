1,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_SEQ_01","Although Ryne was pushed to her limits as she struggled to seize control of Eden, it seems that she eventually succeeded. However, as she struggles to assert control over the mysterious entity, a warning sounds, and Ryne becomes acutely aware that Eden is being attacked from both within and without by unknown invaders. Thancred and Urianger race to repel the assailants that are approaching from the inner reaches, while you make your way to the exterior to confront an airborne foe as it swoops down from above.

※Eden's Gate: Descent can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_SEQ_02","Though you are hard-pressed by a relentless aerial assault, you eventually succeed in clipping the enemy's wings. With victory secured, you prepare to join your comrades to find out whether Urianger and Thancred were able to put down the intruders."
3,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_SEQ_03","Though you had assumed your vanquished foe to be unconscious, she struggles to her feet and threatens to finish what she had started. Before you, Thancred, and Urianger are drawn into another confrontation, Ryne steps forward to intervene, for reasons that perhaps she herself does not fully understand. After a brief and puzzling exchange of words, the girl collapses, leaving the rest of you to wonder what her true intentions might be. Thancred suggests taking her to the camp, in the hope that she may shed some light on the mysteries surrounding Eden once she has recovered."
4,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_SEQ_04","Now that the danger has been averted, Ryne is able to turn her attention to strengthening her link with the core. She explains that not only is Eden more receptive to her commands, she has also made something of a discovery."

68,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_RYNE_000_027","From what I can tell, Eden is able to form simple structures by redirecting aether, so I'll try to give you something to stand on. When you're ready, head for that portal over there."
69,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_RYNE_000_030","Come on, Eden! Show me what you can do!"

71,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_THANCRED_000_041","We came as soon as we took care of our unwanted guests. They were a stubborn bunch and quite unlike anything I've ever seen in the First."

78,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_THANCRED_000_048","She didn't seem too pleased with Ryne taking control of Eden, which may be what caused her to appear out of the blue. Beyond that, it's anyone's guess."
79,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_URIANGER_000_049","'Tis plain she is not a sin eater. Not even in part as Vauthry was."
80,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_URIANGER_000_050","Yet this knowledge does little to assuage my fears, for she is nonetheless possessed of a power most terrible."
81,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_THANCRED_000_051","On the other hand, if she's feeling cooperative, she might be able to tell us more about Eden."
82,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_THANCRED_000_052","I'll keep an eye on her until she wakes up. There's no telling what will happen when she does, but I'll make it clear that we mean her no harm. Well, no further harm, at the very least."
83,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_THANCRED_000_053","Obviously, it's not a good idea to bring her inside Eden. It's likely that reaching the core was her aim from the outset, so I'll take her to the camp."
84,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_RYNE_000_054","Now that things have settled down, I should get back inside and try strengthening my link to Eden."
85,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_THANCRED_000_060","The girl is in the tent, fast asleep. Or possibly in a coma. One or the other. Either way, we have little choice but to wait for her to wake up."
86,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_URIANGER_000_061","I have yet to discover the means by which the exterior was breached, though 'twould appear that the fiends that Thancred and I slew were of a similar nature to those led by thine own adversary. Voidsent, in other words."
87,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_RYNE_000_070","Although I had my hands full trying to control Eden, I caught a glimpse of your battle. That power... I've never seen anything like it."
88,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_URIANGER_100_070","What thou witnessed was the tearing of the very fabric of reality─the creation of a rift through which voidsent may enter. But pray tell, Ryne, didst thou make any other observations?"

93,"TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_URIANGER_000_071","Though I think it unlikely that she is an Ascian, she may yet be thrall to Zodiark."
