As you attempt to divine what could have happened, you witness Alisaie leaping off a nearby building in pursuit of a fleeing sin eater. You approach as she finishes off her prey, and your long-awaited reunion quickly becomes an eager exchange of news."

50,"TEXT_LUCKMA305_03295_TESLEEN_000_002","You could wait, I suppose─but why not go and surprise her!? She usually takes a look at things from the watchtower first, so you might be able to catch her there."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMA305_03295_TESLEEN_000_003","It's not far─head out the south side and you'll soon see it. I'll stay behind, in case she comes back while you're gone."
