Mogek seems to be fixated on your tool belt."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_01","The Mogmenders are restoring an abandoned crafting facility in the Rookery, and Mogek would enlist the aid of his favorite artisan. He bids you seek out his moogle workers to learn what work there is to be done.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_02","You speak with a moogle who tells you of how man and dragon once used the Rookery in the past, and how the Mogmenders are committed to restoring its crafting facilities. Unfortunately, he has no tasks befitting one of your skills. He suggests speaking with his partner, who has been taking note of what needs to be fixed or replaced in the Rookery."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_03","You find a moogle lamenting piles of rusted machinery once used for cutting fabric. He intends to salvage what he can from them, and asks you to craft components for their eventual replacements. Completed works should then be taken to his helpmeet.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the miffed moogle."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_04","The helpmeet moogle seems lost in thought when you approach, pleasantly surprised by your delivery of new components. All that remains is to inform Mogek that your work is complete."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_05","Mogek is glad to see you return so quickly. Grateful for your contributions to the Mogmenders' work, he is certain these crafting facilities will be of great use in the future."

49,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_MOGEK_000_001","There is much to be gained by having such a place to work, which is why I've set the Mogmenders to work scouring the area for salvageable equipment. I'm sure their work would go faster with your help."
50,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_MOGEK_000_002","As to specifically how you can assist, you'll have to speak with the Mogmenders to see what still needs fixing."
51,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_CRAFTSMOOGLE02304_000_010","You must be that master artisan I've heard so much about, kupo! Welcome, welcome!"
52,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_CRAFTSMOOGLE02304_000_011","Here on this very spot─or rather, down the stairs there near those dreadful wyverns─landlords astride skylords would descend from on high. Such transport was possible thanks to special equipment made here in the Rookery."
53,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_CRAFTSMOOGLE02304_000_012","The facilities that produced this equipment have fallen into disarray from centuries of neglect, but never fear. When we finish here they will be good as new, kupo!"
54,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_CRAFTSMOOGLE02304_000_013","Though, your talents would be wasted on the few tasks I have at present. Hmmm. Perhaps you should speak with my fellow Mogmender. He's conducted a rather thorough survey of the grounds and should know what is most in need of repair."
55,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_CRAFTSMOOGLE02304_000_014","I have no jobs worthy of your skill, but I'm certain my companion just over yonder will have a task or three for you, kupo."
56,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_WORKUNDERMOOGLE02304_000_015","So many parts, so little time. What are we to do, kupo?"
57,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_RECEIPTMOOGLE02304_000_016","The Rookery is truly a sight to behold. Or at least, it will be when we finish, kupo!"
58,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_WORKUNDERMOOGLE02304_000_020","Come for work, have you? Well you're in luck, kupo! I have checked every nook and cranny of the Rookery, and let me tell you, I would much rather build the whole thing from scratch than repair what the landlords left behind."
59,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_WORKUNDERMOOGLE02304_000_021","At present, I'm working on a few old fabric-shearing machines. Nothing but lumps of rust if you ask me. I can try to salvage pieces from them, but I need you to fashion a new set of blades."

66,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_RECEIPTMOOGLE02304_000_031","New parts! Kupopopo! We could do well to have a few more workers like you around. Many thanks, friend."
67,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_WORKUNDERMOOGLE02304_000_032","We've still a long way to go, but mark my words: the landlords of old would be jealous if they could see what we have planned, kupo!"

70,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_MOGEK_000_040","Back so soon? If only the others could work with such haste. Then again, recreating equipment from a thousand years ago is no small feat."
71,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_MOGEK_000_041","It will be worth it in the end, though. Those facilities will soon be of great use in our work. I can feel it in my pom, kupo!"
