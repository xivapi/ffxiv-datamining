Mogek has interesting news to share."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_SEQ_01","Mogek tells you of special statues once used to harness the magicks of dragons and a recent discovery of such devices in the Monsterie. In the hopes of discovering how they were used, he means to reawaken them with the help of Whei Ahf. Rather than go himself, of course, Mogek asks you to speak with Whei Ahf and convince him to help.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_SEQ_02","In your search for Whei Ahf you find a young dragonling. You speak to him of Mogek's plan and he summons Whei Ahf to assist you. Ride to the Monsterie and awaken the long-dormant statues.

※Speak with the dextrous dragonet in Bahrr Lehs to mount Whei Ahf."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_SEQ_03","You happen upon a statue with an unusual carving reminiscent of a dragon. It reacts to the bellowing cry of Whei Ahf and soon pulses with energy. The dragon then bids you continue searching for more strangely carved constructs."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_SEQ_04","You find another statue, much like the last, and with another cry from Whei Ahf it begins to glow. He senses the last one close by and carries you off to resume your search."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_SEQ_05","Whei Ahf lets out a terrible roar that stirs both the ancient statue and a moogle sentry asleep at his post. Assuring you he was focused and alert, he takes notice of the glowing statue and makes a note to inform the Mogmenders. This reminds you that Mogek will also want to hear of your success."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_SEQ_06","Mogek is relieved to hear you had no troubles on your journey with Whei Ahf. He explains that the magic of the dragon's roar overwhelms moogles, sometimes causing pain or discomfort. You can be certain the moogles will call upon you should they again have need of the dragon's power."

49,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_MOGEK_000_001","As luck would have it, we recently found three at the Monsterie still intact, kupo! What were they used for? That's what we mean to find out."
50,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_MOGEK_000_002","The quickest way to do so would be to reactivate them, and that will require the aid of our good friend Whei Ahf. I would go myself, but I'm much too busy. Yes, that's it. Busy! Now then, off you go."

63,"TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_NEARMOOGLE02306_000_043","You won't say anything about what you saw to Mogek, will you? He'll have my pom if he hears I was sleeping on duty again, kupo."
