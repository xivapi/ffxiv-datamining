Mogek has need of a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> with a silver tongue."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_SEQ_01","Unable to perform the heavy lifting required to proceed with construction, the Mogmenders now turn to the dragons for aid. Mogek, however, is concerned their representative may make promises they cannot keep. He implores you to meet with them at Zenith before any rash decisions are made.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_SEQ_02","You are greeted by a moogle who is all smiles, telling you a deal was made just moments before your arrival. If only the dragons had interest in what was offered. Rather than the cloud mallow or kupo nuts one would expect of moogles, they demanded a number of gratuitous items that only one of your expertise could hope to craft. Supplied with materials, the moogle representative implores you to fulfill the dragons' request.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mediating moogle."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_SEQ_03","You craft two masterpieces which are then offered up to appease the dragons. Satisfied with your work, they consent to lend their strength to the moogles. Return to Bahrr Lehs and inform Mogek the crisis he anticipated has been averted."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_SEQ_04","Mogek is relieved to know the dragons have agreed to help. With the Mogmenders now able to focus on the beauty of their work, he suspects the monument may turn out to be more magnificent than even your favorite moogle overseer."

50,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_MOGEK_000_002","That is, of course, if we can agree on proper payment. There is little we can offer at present, and the Mogmenders are like to be intimidated by the dragons' imposing presence. We need someone who can look them in the eye and strike a fair deal."
51,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_MOGEK_000_003","No doubt they're at Zenith discussing terms even as we speak. Please hurry, before we're up to our poms in debt, kupo!"

55,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_NEGOTIATEMOOGLEA02303_000_013","Instead, they ask for metal covers fitted for their claws, kupo! They say their claws are chipped, and must be kept safe until they regrow."
56,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_NEGOTIATEMOOGLEA02303_000_014","Instead, they ask for nests of sorts made of soft materials, that they may rest easy whenever they come to Zenith."

71,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_MOGEK_000_040","The Mogmenders tell me a certain someone's help was vital in negotiating with the dragons. Naturally, I assumed they meant yours truly. Imagine my embarrassment when I remembered I'd sent you on that errand! Well done, kupo!"
72,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_MOGEK_000_041","I really cannot thank you enough. Do you have any idea how many moogles it would take to carry even one of those boulders? Neither do I. Just trying to imagine it leaves me exhausted."
73,"TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_MOGEK_000_042","But with dragons handling the more strenuous labor, the Mogmenders can give more attention to detail. I daresay the monument may even turn out more marvelous than me, kupo!"
