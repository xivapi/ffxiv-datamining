0,"TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_00","The raven-haired registrar would make a special request of you.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_01","The raven-haired registrar has tasked you with delivering presents to the unfortunate younglings of the children's ward. Taking care to don your Starlight robe to properly assume the role of one of the saint's little helpers, go forth and spread merriment and good cheer, that the children might have reason to smile this day.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_02","The beaming smiles of the younglings fill your heart with joy. And yet, one undelivered present still remains. Might there be a child whose prayers to the Spinner remain unanswered? Doubtless the raven-haired registrar has the answer."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_03","Upon seeing the remaining present, the registrar explains there is indeed one child who remains unaccounted for: Reauverre, a young boy who presumably slipped out of the children's ward unattended. He further surmises that it is the selfsame Reauverre who stole away with the missing parcel that you recovered. Fearing for the boy's safety, he dashes out for the Ruby Road Exchange in search, and entreats you to join him."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_04","You find young Reauverre in the markets, yearningly gazing at a loving father and his son. Noticing your presence, he apologizes profusely for having caused you trouble, and promises to return to the children's ward, though with some clear reluctance. You stride off in search of the raven-haired registrar, who will doubtless be pleased to hear the boy is safe."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_05","The raven-haired registrar breathes a sigh of relief upon hearing that young Reauverre is safe and sound, though he remains troubled by the boy's behavior. He bids you join him back at the children's ward, where he is determined to ascertain the reason for Reauverre's sudden proclivity for mischief-making."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_06","You return to the children's ward to find a sullen Reauverre angrily dismissing the concerns of the compassionate registrar. The boy begins to run away, but suddenly collapses. As Reauverre rests in his bed, the registrar reveals that while the boy's illness is not immediately life-threatening, the rarity of a herb required in its treatment has resulted in extending his stay at the ward moons longer than originally anticipated. Notwithstanding this, the boy has always shown admirable courage in facing his sickness, which makes his recent behavior all the more troubling. As the raven-haired registrar laments his inability to help the suffering boy, you cannot help but sympathize with his plight..."
