1,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_SEQ_01","According to Unukalhai, aetheric readings taken by Y'shtola in the aftermath of the VIth Legion's recent intrusion indicate that the eikon Sophia is close to awakening. Make haste to Azys Lla and rendezvous with the masked youth on the Flagship, in readiness to put the ancient goddess down."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_SEQ_02","Barely have you joined Unukalhai when the ground begins to rumble to the sound of nearby battle. In the next moment, a breathless Krile appears and announces that Y'shtola and Urianger have engaged an unknown band of assailants. You hurry to the scene of the conflict to find a trio of strangers whom you determine to be thralls of the eikon Sophia. Though they do not linger long, they leave you with the words of an ominous prophecy, and the fear that their mistress may have already awoken in possession of all her terrible might. Time is of the essence. Summon your faithful comrades to your side and cast down the dread Goddess lest all be judged upon her scales!

※Containment Bay P1T6 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_SEQ_03","You have banished Sophia into the aether. Make your way back to the Flagship."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_SEQ_04","Following your victory over the Goddess, Y'shtola muses on the reason for her rapid awakening─a question to which Unukalhai and Krile soon provide an answer. According to their investigation, the eikon enslaved the will of a careless Garlean soldier and commanded him to release her thralls. Allagan records also speak of a failed plot to exploit a flaw introduced into the machinery of Sophia's prison─a scheme that came dangerously close to being enacted millennia later. Even as you make your way back to the Rising Stones and Unukalhai, you are haunted by the thought of what might have come to pass had the Goddess been suffered to escape her fetters."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_SEQ_05","You rejoin Unukalhai in Revenant's Toll, where you witness Y'shtola berating the masked youth for seeming to place you on a pedestal. Their differing views on what can and cannot be expected of you apart, all seem to agree that the last pillar of the Warring Triad must fall, and that only with its destruction will the world finally be free of the existential threat posed by Azys Lla."

70,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_117","Mistress Krile─do you perchance recall the words of the prophecy in its entirety?"
71,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_KRILE_000_118","Ah, let me see... I believe it was, “With scales in hand, the Goddess shall arise,

Might judge and thence bring balance unto all.”"
72,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_120","""Bring balance unto all...“
One suspects their notion of bringing balance has little to do with fostering harmony."
73,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_YSHTOLA_000_130","I see the Goddess is no more. Well done. Once Krile and Unukalhai have rejoined us, we may safely depart."
74,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_YSHTOLA_000_131","...One thing yet puzzles me, however. How did Sophia's servants come to wake from their slumber?"
75,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_KRILE_000_132","I believe we have the answer to that!"
76,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_133","We discovered the remains of a Garlean soldier in an adjacent sector of the containment facility. 'Tis like that the fool ventured too close to Sophia during the Empire's previous incursion, and was enthralled for his troubles."
77,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_134","Another reminder, if any were needed, as to the incalculable threat posed by these beings. The Goddess would not even have been conscious when she claimed the man's will. And yet his mistake granted her the means to release her servants, and would have resulted in her own liberation had we not been on hand to intervene."
78,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_URIANGER_000_135","I do much wonder that the eikon's pawn was capable of so effectively manipulating the facility's containment systems. How came he by such rarefied knowledge?"
79,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_136","That too is easily explained. During our investigation, Krile discovered a subtle flaw in one of the mechanisms which held the Goddess in check. A flaw which had plainly been added intentionally. Upon examining the facility's records of the period, we were able to piece together the story."
80,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_137","It was a time towards the end of the Third Astral Era, when the peoples of Meracydia faced extinction at the hands of the Allagan Empire. Sophia, a being of incomparable cunning, was said to have communicated certain plans to her servants through the medium of a trusted oracle."
81,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_138","Following the oracle's instructions, they duly conspired with a rebel faction within Allag who, we believe, agreed to tamper with the prison intended for Sophia. And then the Goddess and her thralls chanced to be captured─though we suspect that this had always been their plan."
82,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_KRILE_000_139","Indeed. The prison was situated at the heart of Allag, and we think they intended to attack the city from within. They would merely have had to wait for the rebels to exploit the weakness in their confines."
83,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_140","But the conspirators' dealings with the Meracydians were exposed before they could enact their plot, and all were summarily executed. It seems that the flaw itself remained undiscovered, however, and might have remained so until the end of days had it not been for the actions of the archbishop, and subsequently the Garleans."
84,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_KRILE_000_141","I cannot help but wonder what might have come to pass had their scheme been successful. Mayhap the answer lies in the prophecy."
85,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_URIANGER_000_142","Krile hath the right of it. Its words may be deciphered thus: the “cursèd pall” speaketh of Sophia's prison, from which she was supposed to emerge at the agreed hour. The “Wyrmking,” meanwhile, can be none other than great Bahamut himself, then yet a prisoner, whom the Goddess did intend to unleash upon Allag to set right the scales of justice."
86,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_YSHTOLA_000_143","A foolhardy plan. Had it come to fruition, the two of them would surely have razed the realm. Naught would have been spared the devastation, the Meracydians' homeland included."
87,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_144","Their home already stood on the brink of oblivion. Mayhap they wished for naught else but to purge the poison of Allag with primal fire."
88,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_URIANGER_000_145","The tale teacheth us that even the greatest of man's creations may yet be brought low by a single act of treachery. The Allagans were fools to place their trust in technological bondage. To shackle such beings is but to delay the inevitable. Naught save their total destruction shall free us from their menace. Let us return now to the Rising Stones, and there consider the final step of this most needful task."
89,"TEXT_HEAVNY231_02332_UNUKALHAI_000_146","The threat posed by this facility is far greater than you imagine, Urianger...and one not limited to the eikons themselves. Sophia's remaining servants must be put down."
