1,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_01","As Drydox tells it, the Vath deftarm recently paid a visit to Idyllshire in hopes of beseeching your aid with a task of great import. What ambition burns within your ever-earnest pupil this time? The answer awaits you in Loth ast Vath."
2,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_02","The deftarm rejoices at your arrival. He eagerly explains that he is seeking new clients to further expand the Adventurers' Guild in Loth ast Vath, and has reason to believe that establishing relations with the moogles might prove mutually beneficial. Make for the Moghome, that you might serve as a liaison between your enterprising apprentice and the Mogmenders."
3,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_03","You rendezvous with the deftarm at the Churning Mists, where he marvels at both the sights and the moogles themselves before proceeding on to the plaza of Bahrr Lehs. How will Master Mogzin respond to your pupil's offer of aid? Venture forth to preside over this momentous first encounter between moogle and Vath."
4,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_04","Mogzin happily accepts the deftarm's proposal, promptly tasking him with such stimulating tasks as rounding up rubbish and cracking kupo nuts. The Vath is understandably chagrined but undeterred, and trudges forth to complete his duties. In the meantime, Master Mogzin encourages you to pay a visit to Tarresson, who was looking to ask a small favor of you. Return to the plaza and see what the venerable stonemason has in mind."
5,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_05","Heartened by your presence, Tarresson asks for your assistance in buoying the spirits of your mutual friend Ohl Deeh. As he tells it, the dragonet is feeling uncharacteristically disheartened of late, his attempts to muster a majestic roar going for naught despite the tutelage of the mighty Gullinbursti. Mayhap your words of encouragement can reach the young dragon where others' have fallen on deaf ears."
6,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_06","You find Ohl Deeh flagellating himself over his perceived failure in living up to his ideal of what a great dragon should be. It would seem the situation is even more dire than Master Tarresson believed. Is there aught you might do or say to restore him to his confident and cocksure self?"
7,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_07","Your rousing words of exhortation an unqualified success, Ohl Deeh flaps off with a renewed sense of confidence and resolve. Master Tarresson will doubtless be delighted to know that he need no longer fret for the emotional state of his high-strung dragon friend."
8,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_08","Master Tarresson is heartened to hear that Ohl Deeh is back to his usual self, and thanks you for your efforts. Meanwhile, it would seem the deftarm has yet to complete the mindless busywork assigned to him by Master Mogzin. Tarresson encourages you to take a well-deserved respite while you wait for your loyal apprentice to return to Bahrr Lehs."
9,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_09","The deftarm returns from a hard day's work, only to be rewarded for his labors with an explosive prank and a few perfunctory words of gratitude. Unfamiliar with the quirks of moogle culture and communication, the deftarm is incensed, and hurls a few choice invectives at Master Mogzin and the Mogmenders. Just as it seems the two may come to fisticuffs, Ohl Deeh arrives on the scene bearing grave news: the once-kindly Gullinbursti has suddenly flown into a bout of rage, and a Temple Knight now lies wounded or worse. All parties agree to put aside their squabble and investigate this dire situation."
10,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_10","You arrive on the scene to find Gullinbursti staring down your friends with savage fury in his eyes. Heartfelt pleas fall on deaf ears, and the mighty dragon lets out a mighty roar and soars into the heavens, his sudden and inexplicable furor entirely unplacated. Questioning the fallen Temple Knight─whose wounds, most fortunately, were not fatal─reveals that Gullinbursti's terrifying transformation came about after he was shot in a skirmish with a masked man wielding a curious firearm. All agree that the situation must be addressed swiftly before great and lasting damage can be done. At Master Tarresson's suggestion, you set off for Bahrr Lehs, that you and your friends might put your minds together and formulate a plan of attack."
11,"TEXT_BANALL110_02382_SEQ_11","Upon returning to Bahrr Lehs, you confer with your friends, who have resolved to put their differences aside to address the far more pressing matter at hand. Mogzin and Ohl Deeh offer to set out in search of Gullinbursti, while Master Tarresson wisely observes that you will also need to investigate precisely what has befallen the dragon─and how the madness might be reversed─lest future encounters have disastrous consequences. This will involve tracking down the mysterious attacker to glean more information, but who might be best suited for this treacherous task? The plot thickens..."
