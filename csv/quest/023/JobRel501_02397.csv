1,"TEXT_JOBREL501_02397_SEQ_01","Ardashir offers a brief explanation of how the anima's new soulstone will be created, entrusting you with the task of obtaining pneumite─an obscure catalyst essential to the process. Though he is reluctant to admit it, he knows not where they can be purchased or crafted. Ardashir bids you pool all your resources to track down this elusive component."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL501_02397_SEQ_02","You acquire the pneumite through means perhaps better left unspoken. After loading it into the node along with Ardashir's crystals, and completing an unexpected-but-necessary system update, you are the proud owner of a sparkling new soulstone. Once Gerolt is finished forging your weapon, it will not be long before the anima resides in its permanent new home."

50,"TEXT_JOBREL501_02397_ARDASHIR_000_003","Now, it bears mentioning that mine is a new method of soulstone creation. Rather than taking an existing stone and enchanting it, we will fashion a composite of high-purity crystals."
