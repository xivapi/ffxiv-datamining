59,"TEXT_JOBREL399_02334_ULAN_000_001","Assuming we do not attempt to push beyond its current limitations, this should be a trivial matter."
60,"TEXT_JOBREL399_02334_ULAN_000_002","Mind you, this process requires crystal sand. If you have none, I will gladly furnish you with more per our original arrangement."
61,"TEXT_JOBREL399_02334_ULAN_000_003","But you need not worry about umbrite. For this we require elementally aspected sand to ever so slightly alter the anima's aetherial composition."

70,"TEXT_JOBREL399_02334_ULAN_000_031","Nevertheless, it still requires a fair amount of crystal sand. If you require more, you must supply me with materials in exchange. A deal is a deal, after all."
