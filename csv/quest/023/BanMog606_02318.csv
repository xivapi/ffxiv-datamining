Mogek appears to be pondering something."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_01","Mogek is concerned about Mogwon, the manager of the restoration of Asah who is on the verge of pulling out his fur in frustration. He requests that you travel to the area and inquire as to what is troubling the poor moogle.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_02","Mogwon tells you that the restoration is not proceeding nearly as fast as expected, and an exceptionally lazy moogle is to blame for the delay. This particular moogle uses all manner of excuses to put off the work he has been allocated, and Mogwon pleads with you to go and speak with him, mender to mender."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_03","You try to engage the moogle, who is performing stretches in what he calls his “preparatory routine.” He chastises you for disrupting his peace and quiet before flying off to hide behind another building. Find the moogle and try to /psych him up to encourage him to get back to work."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_04","You try your best to encourage the moogle to return to his tasks, but he will have none of it. Threatening that no work will be done if he is disturbed again, he flies away to hide behind another building. Encouragement having been proven ineffective, take a firmer hand and give the moogle a /slap."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_05","Tired of the moogle's excuses, you find him once more and try to slap some sense into him. Initially at a loss for words, he quickly recovers and accuses Mogwon of hypocrisy and refuses to follow his orders. Return to Mogwon and tell him you may have unintentionally exacerbated the situation."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_06","Mogwon decides to follow Master Tarresson's advice and bribe the moogle with a splendid inducement, in the hopes that it might mollify and convince him to return to work. He asks you to craft such a piece and deliver it to the moogle saying it's from Mogwon himself.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mogwon."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_07","The moogle is overwhelmed with joy at the sight of your crafted gift. He soon reflects on his bad behavior and promises he will put more effort into his duties. Report to Mogek that you have solved Mogwon's problem."
8,"TEXT_BANMOG606_02318_SEQ_08","Mogek seems somewhat surprised that a managerial moogle like Mogwon sought out advice on motivation from Tarresson. Knowing Tarresson is a bit of a trickster himself, Mogek shudders to think about what would happen if Mogwon asked him for such advice."
