Master Mogzin is motioning you over."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_01","The Mogmenders are hard at work, but it seems the Mogmenders face a new problem in the restoration of Bahrr Lehs. Tarresson awaits to apprise you and Mogzin of the situation.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_02","The moogles have proven to be apt pupils, quick to learn and eager to work. However, their numbers are few, and the plaza of Bahrr Lehs is littered with large piles of rubble that must be cleared. Tarresson has asked the moogles at Asah for help, but suspects they are withholding aid on purpose, and he tasks Mogzin with bamboozling his kin into fulfilling their obligations. Although Mogzin has never managed to trick another moogle, he is heartened by Tarresson's rousing speech, and is eager to set forth to Asah at once and speak with Mogupp, leader of the moogles there. Tarresson asks you to accompany Mogzin, in case his will flags or his pom droops."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_03","Mogupp claims to have already dispatched the moogles, albeit possibly to the wrong location. He puts on an overly dramatic show of concern before asking you to help find his lost subordinates. Mogzin seemingly goes along with this transparent farce, but something tells you there is more to his kindly smile than meets the eye. The moogle instructs you to meet him at the base of the tower so you might discuss your rescue plan."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_04","With a devilish glint in his eyes, Mogzin declares that he knows precisely what Mogupp is planning, owing to the fact that he fell victim to the same trick multiple times. Emboldened by this stroke of luck, he sets to work outlining his own scheme, but his enthusiasm wanes when he is unable to come up with something immediately. In an effort to lift Mogzin's spirits you remind him of Tarresson's wise words. Your speech serves its purpose, and Mogzin is struck with inspiration. He then departs for Moghome to seek the help of the alchemist Moghan."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_05","It seems Mogzin requires a certain medicine from Moghome's apothecary, but he is hesitant to part with it until Mogzin hands him a sack full of kupo nuts. After the two moogles confer in whispers for a brief moment, Moghan hands over the medicine, ostensibly in an effort to provide the Mogmenders with proper emergency provisions. Mogzin seems satisfied by this arrangement, and says he will meet you at Asah after he completes some final preparations."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_06","Mogupp is fresh-faced and energetic, although he claims to have looked everywhere for his lost moogles. Mogzin declares that he has been tricked, putting on a show of humility that would make Tarresson proud. The haughty Mogupp gladly accepts Mogzin's gift of kupo nut milk and rushes off to celebrate victory with his companions. With the final step of his trick close at hand, Mogzin follows close behind, and bids you accompany him."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_07","From a cliff overlooking the Landlord Colony, you and Mogzin spy Mogupp and the others frolicking around the kupo nut milk. After a short victory speech, they raise their bottles in unison. Before they can celebrate further, however, they become befuddled, and shortly thereafter fall unconscious. It is then that Mogzin reveals the secret ingredient: crushed cloud mallow, which in large quantities has a hypnotic effect. Mogzin flits down to the dozing moogles and whispers words praising the value of labor and hard work, and soon after they perk up and march off towards Bahrr Lehs. Mogzin, eager to see the fruits of his labor, follows them to see what motivated moogles can accomplish."
8,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_08","Bahrr Lehs is alive with the sound of moogles hard at work. Unfortunately, Mogupp and the others are not among them. Mogzin explains that while his special mixture had its desired effect, the moogles collapsed from exhaustion shortly after getting started. Although they have just consumed a heavy dosage of cloud mallow, Mogzin insists that the best way to get them working again is sprinkle even more of the plant over their heads. He bids you mount a cloud mallow and make it rain puffs over the weary moogles."
9,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_09","The moogle watching over the cloud mallow lets you ride it without resistance. He gazes with curious eyes as you soar into the sky.

※Speak with the moofy moogle in Bahrr Lehs to mount a cloud mallow."
10,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_10","You sprinkle mallow on the moogles, and as the puffs settle upon their pom-poms, they spring to life as if reborn. They set to work immediately. Mogzin will surely be eager to hear of this success."
11,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_SEQ_11","Mogzin is overjoyed at your news, and at last he seems to have grasped the importance of hard work and persistence. He reaffirms his conviction to follow Tarresson's words and seems as keen as ever to continue his work on Bahrr Lehs."

50,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_000_010","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, there you are! I must say, the attitude of the Mogmenders is much improved. They have mastered the basics of stonemasonry more quickly than I had anticipated, and remain ever eager to learn. Once the rubble has been cleared, we can begin rebuilding."
51,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_000_011","Therein lies our problem, however. I am afraid we lack the numbers to remove the debris on our own. I requested aid from the moogles of Asah, but have yet to receive a response. Doubtless they are trying to avoid any kind of hard work."
52,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_000_012","And so I would task you, my dear Mogzin, with bringing them here. I give you leave to use whatever trick you can conceive of to get those malingering moogles to Bahrr Lehs."
53,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_MOGZIN_000_013","You want me to fool <Emphasis>moogles</Emphasis>? I've never done that, kupo. Not successfully anyways..."
54,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_000_014","Do not be so quick to lose heart! You fail only because your ideas are half-formed, marred by compromise and poor planning. You must persevere in your efforts if you wish to succeed. It is as the words of my house state: “By the hundredth blow.”"
55,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_100_014","For a single strike of the chisel merely scratches a stone's surface. It is only with constant effort that stones give rise to bricks, to walls, and at last an impregnable fortress. Such is the power of will. Of perseverance. Of determination!"
56,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_MOGZIN_000_015","Will, perseverance, determination... I...I will remember, kupo! Yes, I'll craft a trick so cunning they'll sing songs of it throughout Moghome!"
57,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_000_016","Aye, that's the spirit! You are a leader, and it is past time you took charge. Show the others that the Mogmenders are not to be trifled with!"
58,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_000_017","However, while I have great faith in Mogzin, he still has yet to meet his full potential. Which is why I must ask you to accompany him, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Ensure he does not slip back into his old ways. Give that pom-pom of his a firm shake if you sense his will is wavering."
59,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_MOGZIN_000_018","I'm sure there will be no need for that, kupo! Nevertheless, I would certainly appreciate the company! Well then, shall we be off? We should begin by speaking with Mogupp, the moogle in charge over at Asah."
60,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_MOGZIN_000_019","There he is, kupo! He doesn't look to be up to any mischief. Perhaps there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for why help hasn't arrived after all."
61,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_TARRESSON_000_020","I know our Mogzin has grown, but I fear he still needs guidance. And I believe you are exactly the one to give it to him. For my part, I shall begin preparations to greet our new hands."
62,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_MOGUPP_000_030","Oh, if it isn't Master Mogzin! And the adventurer I've heard so much about! Hmmm, I seem to recall a request of some manner from the Mogmenders... Oh yes, you required extra paws to help move the rubble?"
63,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_MOGZIN_000_031","That's correct, kupo. The request was made some time ago, and still not a single moogle has arrived at Bahrr Lehs. We can't hope to make any progress without them!"
64,"TEXT_BANMOG002_02321_MOGUPP_000_032","Ah yes, who could forget such an unusual name? Of course I dispatched several moogles the moment the missive came, but I'm afraid I may have sent them to the wrong location. Awfully hard to pronounce that name, you see. Why, I suppose they could be anywhere now. And without the provisions for a long journey..."
