1,"TEXT_HEAVNY242_02395_SEQ_01","Unukalhai presents you with an Allagan tomestone that contains detailed information on generating an enhanced simulacrum of the eikon Zurvan. He explains that only the most exceptional of Allag's warriors were expected to triumph against this artificial entity, and suggests that, as the Warrior of Light, you might benefit from the experience. Take the tomestone to the Flagship, and present the recording device to the verification node."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY242_02395_SEQ_02","Upon receiving the tomestone, the verification node initiates what it refers to as an “elimination trial,” presumably intended to further cull the unworthy from the Allagan warrior elite. Assemble a band of courageous companions, and face the Demon in all of his unrestrained might!
