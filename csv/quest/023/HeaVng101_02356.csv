0,"TEXT_HEAVNG101_02356_SEQ_00","The interminable wait for news from Gridania seems to be taking its toll on Alisaie."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNG101_02356_SEQ_01","After receiving a timely message via linkpearl, Alisaie informs you that the Alliance council will soon be reconvening in Gridania. Make your way to Nophica's Altar, and announce your arrival to the silent conjurer."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNG101_02356_SEQ_02","As the council debates how best to combat the incalculable threat contained within the cocoon of light, an unexpected figure seizes his moment to take the stage: Nero tol Scaeva. The disgraced imperial engineer proceeds to proffer what might kindly be termed a “bold” solution to the problem, and is duly ridiculed by Cid. The Alliance leaders, however, are not so quick to dismiss the man's proposal, anything being preferable to another Calamity, and they grudgingly agree to send a contingent to awaken the infamous Allagan weapon known as “Omega.” Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on this surprising turn of events."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNG101_02356_SEQ_03","It is plain that Alphinaud harbors grave misgivings about the timing of Nero's reappearance. Press him on how best to proceed."

Riol's report needs to be filed, Alianne has requested additional supplies, and then there's─ Oh! Don't mind me! Everything's under control!"

59,"TEXT_HEAVNG101_02356_ALPHINAUD_000_011","Well, that was a rather unexpected development, and one which raises a number of questions...not least among them how Nero chanced to learn of the council meeting in the first place."
