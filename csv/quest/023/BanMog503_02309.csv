Mogek is awaiting you with bated breath."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_01","Mogek apprises you of a discovery by the Mogmenders of a series of dragon statues on the perimeters of the Rookery, which appear have other uses given that unlike other statues, they glow with a faint light. He asks you to enlist the help of Whei Ahf, and travel to the Rookery to see if the statues respond to dragon magicks.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_02","The little dragonling gladly calls Whei Ahf for you, whose back you climb upon. Make your way to the Rookery and have Whei Ahf use his roar on one of the statues.

※Speak with the dextrous dragonet in Bahrr Lehs to mount Whei Ahf."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_03","When Whei Ahf breathes his magicks upon the first statue, its faint purple hue gleams brightly, sending a beam of light to the heavens. The wiry wyvern comments that it is strange that a man-made statue would react in such a way in the present. Curious, he suggests you make your way along the perimeter until all are awoken."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_04","As you move on to the next statue, Whei Ahf recalls the stories of his elders and how wyverns would bear men upon their backs, just as you are doing now. Continue to make your way around the perimeter towards the next statue."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_05","Upon awakening the third statue, Whei Ahf mulls whether the statues can only be awakened in the presence of both man and dragon, which is why they had long been left dormant. Make your way to the final statue."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_06","In awakening the last statue, you hear the curious sound of stone scraping in the distance as if a door has been opened, and a nearby moogle wonders what could have been unlocked through the activating the statues. The investigation will need to be left to the moogles as Whei Ahf wishes to return to the plaza. Report your success to Mogek."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_07","Mogek is pleased with the cooperative efforts between you and Whei Ahf in testing the statues' magicks. He reflects that if the men and dragons of yore are watching in the heavens, they would be proud that you both once again stand in solidarity as they once had."

49,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_MOGEK_000_001","Well, one of our moogles was investigating the stone dragons around the perimeters and found they were no mere ornaments. Unlike other statues, these ones faintly glow. We think they served a more useful purpose."
50,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_MOGEK_000_002","We want to see if they react in the presence of dragon magicks, and for that we need Whei Ahf! Could you summon him to roar upon the statues?"

53,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_WYVERNRECEPTION02309_000_012","He said there are many mysterious stone sculptures that seem to respond to dragon magicks under certain conditions, although we are unsure why or how."
54,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_WYVERNRECEPTION02309_000_013","Perhaps Whei Ahf knows better how to awaken them. Wait here and I shall call him for you."

56,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SYSTEM_000_015","The dragon statue pulses faintly with a mysterious light. Have Whei Ahf use his Roar to see if it reacts."

64,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SYSTEM_000_050","The magicks in the stone statue stir as if awakened by Whei Ahf's roar.
You hear a sound of heavy stone scraping in the distance."

66,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_WYVERN02309_000_052","(-Whei Ahf-)Perhaps the true functions of these statues have been lost to time. The men and dragons of the peaceful age had been known to make instruments that were mutually useful to both."

70,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_MOGEK_000_061","The men and dragons before the time of the great war must have had a truly unique bond to create such devices. If they are watching from the heavens, I am certain they would be happy you and Whei Ahf are bearing the torch, so to speak, kupo."
