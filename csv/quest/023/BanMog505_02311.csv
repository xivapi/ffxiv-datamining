Mogek looks around as if he is waiting for someone."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SEQ_01","Mogek explains to you that the Temple Knight sappers had arranged for an airship to deliver sundries that the moogles could not provide for their work. However, there have been no signs or news of the airship which was to deliver the cargo bells ago. Mogek requests that you travel to the Rookery to see if there have been any mishaps.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SEQ_02","It appears that the airship made it safely to the Rookery, but the wary knight in charge of the delivery tells you that dragonets have surrounded the airship. Unwilling to draw his spear for fear of provoking, he asks that you ask the dragonlings what they want with the ship."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SEQ_03","You approach one of the curious dragonlings who asks you about the airship. Upon explaining its function, the dragonling grows excited and begins clamoring for an airship of his own. Apprise the Temple Knight of the dragons' request."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SEQ_04","The Temple Knight is less than enthused with the dragons' demand for airships, saying that he has no time for games. He entrusts the task to you as someone better suited to craft the pieces. Make a set of toy airships for the dragonets using the materials that the Temple Knight has provided.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the tense Temple Knight."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SEQ_05","Using the scraps that the Temple Knight gave you, you cobble together three toy airships on the spot and give them to the excited dragonets. The dragons playfully toss their new trinkets off the side of the isle and pursue them in flight, disappearing into the clouds below. Tell the Temple Knight he is free to return to unloading the cargo from his airship."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SEQ_06","The Temple Knight shows some relief at the departure of the dragonets and muses on their curiosity and desires similar to children. Return to Mogek and tell him that the shipment should arrive shortly."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SEQ_07","You explain the reason behind the delay to Mogek, who comments that it was good you were there in case the situation escalated. He also quips that since the dragonets will remain their same curious selves for decades to come, if the Temple Knight's son came to the Churning Mists someday, he would probably see the same inquisitive pups that his father saw."

49,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_MOGEK_000_001","The sappers said that they would send for sundries that we cannot provide ourselves. The shipment should have arrived at the Rookery by now, but we have not received any word for a while. Where could they be?"
50,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_MOGEK_000_002","Oh, I hope that their airship did not run aground─or worse, run afoul of Nidhogg's brood. Could you go and take a look for me, kupo?"
51,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_ISHGARDSOLDIER02311_000_010","Ho there, adventurer! I am in need of your assistance. We were in the midst of unloading our cargo when these dragons showed up and surrounded the airship! We quickly carried off what cargo we could. I have my spear, yet I would rather not provoke the ire of a dragon mother, wherever she may be."
52,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_ISHGARDSOLDIER02311_000_011","Needless to say, this had led to a considerable delay... You have dealt with your fair share of dragons, I am sure. Will you go and ask them what they want with our ship?"

61,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_ISHGARDSOLDIER02311_000_032","I have no time for this nonsense. You look as though you are good with your hands. Here, take these scraps of metal and hammer them together yourself."

70,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_SYSTEM_000_041","The dragonets toss their airships off the edge of the isle. As gravity overtakes their maiden voyages, the laughing pups swoop down after them and disappear into the clouds below."
71,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_ISHGARDSOLDIER02311_000_050","Well, they seem to be satisfied with your handiwork."
72,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_ISHGARDSOLDIER02311_000_051","Though I must say their demands were most unexpected. To think that we might have bared steel against beings with desires no different than children. Anyhow, I thank you for your assistance, adventurer."
73,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_ISHGARDSOLDIER02311_000_052","That's that, then. You can relay to our sappers that they should have their deliveries made once we get the rest of the cargo off the airship."
74,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_MOGEK_000_060","A group of dragonets surrounded the airship? Sounds like it could have been a recipe for disaster, kupo. You and I already know that dragonlings mean no harm, but I suppose ordinary men may still see them as a threat. It was good that you were there to prevent any further escalation."
75,"TEXT_BANMOG505_02311_MOGEK_000_061","I hear dragonets remain their same inquisitive selves for decades before they become fully grown dragons. If you think about it, when that Temple Knight's son becomes a man, he will likely see the same exact bright-eyed pups his father had, kupo!"
