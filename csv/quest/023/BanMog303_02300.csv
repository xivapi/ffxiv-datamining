Mogek the Marvelous is staring at two unevenly sized blocks of stone."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG303_02300_SEQ_01","Rocks of every shape and size have been arriving at the restoration site, and the Mogmenders overseeing the monument's reconstruction have not been at all shy about voicing their complaints to Mogek. Claiming that the melange of rocks has rendered all the shipments they received from the stonemasons next to worthless from a builder's standpoint, a flustered Mogek turns to you for help. Travel to Zenith and speak with the masonry moogle.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG303_02300_SEQ_02","The lead stonemason is taken aback to learn the construction moogles had been receiving such an incongruous variety of rocks with each shipment. Deciding the best way to ensure the standardization of their product is to cut down the larger blocks to match the size of the smaller ones, he asks that you produce an item with which the masons will be able to do so. Synthesize stonemasonry supplies and see that they are delivered to the apprentice stonemasons.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the masonry moogle."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG303_02300_SEQ_03","The newest stonemasons gather around as you work and are impressed when you reveal your final product to them. Instilled with a renewed sense of motivation, they return to Asah to take another attempt at carving rocks."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG303_02300_SEQ_04","The novice stonemasons present you with their latest attempt at producing a uniform set of stone blocks. Confident that they have improved, they ask that you deliver them to Mogek to receive his seal of approval."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG303_02300_SEQ_05","Mogek is pleased to see the set of stones appear to be the exact same shape and size. He is certain even the construction moogles who had previously expressed their discontent will be appeased."
