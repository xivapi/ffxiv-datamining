1,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_01","Anogg and Konogg have apparently gone long enough without annoying the dig site chief that he has become concerned─concerned that they are plotting something behind his back. Given certain recent developments for which they were present, you cannot deny this possibility, nor should you have much trouble guessing where they might be found..."
2,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_02","You find Anogg and Konogg before the now-unguarded entrance to the machine graveyard. They lament that the door remains locked, but fortunately, you have a remedy for their woes: the key dropped by the disgraced watchman. Once you have handed it over to Anogg, there is little question as to whether or not the three of you will be heading inside to explore."
3,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_03","You proceed down the excavation tunnel and make a rather explosive entrance into a reasonably large underground chamber, where you find several odd-looking and apparently territorial machina. Anogg and Konogg make short work of them with their bombs, and rush to the side of a strangely garbed woman lying prone─completely ignoring the indignant site chief, presumably drawn by the thunderous report of multiple unauthorized explosions, in so doing. The mysterious woman in white identifies herself as “2P,” but gives no further details, instead insisting that you delve deeper into the ruins to stop the “machine lifeforms”─which you gather must be the machina from earlier─without further ado. "
4,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_04","Though 2P finds her ingress further into the ruins stymied by a technologically secured door, Anogg and Konogg are not above using the same trick thrice, and blow the entire locking mechanism to smithereens before anyone can so much as make an alternative proposal. The way thus cleared, you are free at last to seek the truth of the machine graveyard─with Anogg and Konogg at your side whether you like it or not.

5,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_05","Through the metal doors, you find not broken remains scattered across the floor of a darkened cave, but rather rusted metal structures growing out of a verdant valley, reaching skyward and stretching into the distance as far as the eye can see. 2P tells you that this place was used in the manufacture of the so-called machine lifeforms, and indeed, no small number of them remain within. You fight your way past mechanical monsters great and greater until at last you come upon an adversary of an altogether different nature. Though you sense that this 9S and 2P have a complex relationship, you have no opportunity to press for details, as a heated battle ensues almost immediately. Though you are ultimately victorious, there is no telling what might emerge next, and 2P suggests that you withdraw for a time. Reading the exhaustion writ on her face, you agree."
6,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_06","Emerging from the factory, you see 2P lying on a nearby bed that has been hastily assembled from crates and sleeping mats. Perhaps the battle took more out of her than you had been led to believe."
7,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_07","You speak with Konogg, who tells you that 2P collapsed as they emerged from the ruins, and─sort of─compliments you for not having done the same. Just then, 2P reawakens. She remains conscious long enough to tell you that both she and 9S are mechanical constructs made to resemble men, that more such “androids” may be on their way to attack Komra as you speak, and that a “key” to understanding─and perhaps defeating─them lies somewhere within the factory. She then ceases to function entirely, coming to a stop all of a sudden like a wind-up automaton."
8,"TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_08","Though there was a thoroughly overwhelming amount to consider in what 2P told you, Anogg appears rather fixated on the “powerful item inside the ruins” bit, insisting that you seek it out posthaste. She also provides you with a new tool of her own design─the portable archive─which you may use to record interesting observations in the course of your investigation. With so much of the unfamiliar landscape that has been so well hidden within Kholusia as yet unexplored, it will doubtless see plenty of use.
