1,"TEXT_LUCKMH101_03761_SEQ_01","You return to the Rising Stones to speak with Krile, who informs you that the Scions' bodies remain stable for the interim. Before she has time to inquire after your efforts in the First, however, an unexpected visitor arrives─Maxima. Unforeseen threats may soon arise from within Garlemald, and Commander Aldynn would discuss strategy with you. Not wanting to leave the realm's woes solely on your shoulders, Krile accompanies you to offer what insight she can."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMH101_03761_SEQ_02","As you step into the conference room, you are taken aback to see Commander Aldynn in talks with Gaius Baelsar. He recounts his battle in the imperial palace with a Zenos now whole of body and spirit, followed by an equally startling revelation─the Empire is developing a new Ultima Weapon, and one of its prototypes may soon find its way to Eorzea."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMH101_03761_SEQ_03","Once more the realm is faced with great peril, as are the Scions whose link to the Source grows woefully thin. To which plight will you turn your attention first?"

59,"TEXT_LUCKMH101_03761_MAXIMA_000_011","Indeed. As you may have heard, the imperial capital is in turmoil, and a sizable portion of the Garlean forces have been recalled from the Ghimlyt Dark."
