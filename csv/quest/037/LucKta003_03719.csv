1,"TEXT_LUCKTA003_03719_SEQ_01","You speak with Anogg, who rushes off to chase the “key” that 2P bade you recover before you can get so much as a word in edgeways. At this point, there is little for you or Konogg to do but follow."
2,"TEXT_LUCKTA003_03719_SEQ_02","Catching up to Anogg deeper within the ruins, Konogg attempts to dissuade her from rushing headlong into danger at 2P's behest, making the rather astute observation that you hardly know her and you definitely do <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> know her true intentions. Anogg, however, refuses to consider that he may have a point, and insists upon cooperation with the android, believing it to be the most expedient means of making even greater discoveries. It seems that you have no choice but to pick a side."

52,"TEXT_LUCKTA003_03719_ANOGG_000_052","Oh, so you'd have us sit on our hands instead of pursuing the untold power that sleeps in these ruins? Twiddle our thumbs while others race ahead and claim the prize?"
