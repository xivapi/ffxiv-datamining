49,"TEXT_LUCKMH103_03763_YSHTOLA_000_001","To think we will not only have Zenos to contend with once we return, but a new Ultima Weapon as well. <sigh> Why must all of our enemies insist on returning from their graves?"

54,"TEXT_LUCKMH103_03763_ALPHINAUD_000_015","I suggest we hurry. Lyna does not strike me as one who enjoys being made to wait."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMH103_03763_LYNA_000_020","We have little time, so I will be brief. A sin eater has been sighted in Lakeland, and I ask for your assistance in slaying it."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMH103_03763_ALPHINAUD_000_021","A sin eater? I had heard some few yet remained after the night had returned, but...perhaps we should call the others."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMH103_03763_LYNA_000_022","That will not be necessary. It is only a single sin eater. A simple task for our guard, I should think."

70,"TEXT_LUCKMH103_03763_INJUREDB03607_000_033","I was at death's door that day after the sin eaters attacked. If you and yours hadn't come along, I'd have likely stepped through. And I wouldn't have been alone."
