0,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_SEQ_00","Gaia is lost in thought as she gazes towards the silent giant on the horizon."
1,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_SEQ_01","Gaia's request to be taken to Eden has been fulfilled, yet the faerie she claims inhabits her mind is refusing to react in any way whatsoever. As it was only when Eden first began to move that the faerie drove her to attack, she suggests proceeding with the plan to restore the Empty as originally intended. Though the possibility that Gaia will lose control and attempt to destroy Eden cannot be ignored, the party agrees to cooperate with her wishes, and proceeds towards the core."
2,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_SEQ_02","Urianger suggests that as the water and earth elements remain in a state of passivity, lightning should be used as a catalyst to invigorate the Empty and allow for greater changes to occur. As Ryne has learned about the primals of the Source from Thancred, she nominates Ramuh as the representative of this particular element, while Urianger selects the Gandof Thunder Plains as the location for the summoning. Being the third such occasion, you and Ryne have grown accustomed to the process for drawing forth the aether and melding it into a deiform entity, although the results themselves are somewhat difficult to predict. You grit your teeth and prepare to face the unknown foe, with Ryne standing by to provide support.

※Eden's Verse: Fulmination can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_SEQ_03","While the Ramuh you faced is a far cry from the benevolent protector of the Black Shroud, you nevertheless triumph over the embodiment of lightning. Your task complete, you return to Eden's core where your companions await."
4,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_SEQ_04","Despite Eden traveling a considerable distance across the Empty and drawing forth enormous amounts of lightning-aspected aether, Gaia's faerie remains silent. Upon arriving back at the camp, Ryne is similarly dejected when she notices a distinct lack of visible change in the environment, though Thancred and Urianger claim that the defeat of Ramuh affected the ambient aether of the air above, rather than the ground below. With three of the six elements now restored, Urianger expresses the need for yet more dynamic energy to establish the natural cycle of rainfall and evaporation. Meanwhile, Gaia returns to silent introspection, pondering on the faerie's true intentions."

89,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_THANCRED_000_046","And as central to our lives as names are, I believe that it isn't the name itself, but the bonds it symbolizes that matter most."

91,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_048","My mother and father would constantly blather on about how the Flood of Light could return to end the world when we least expect it, and that we should live each day as though it were our last."

93,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_050","That was until they were selected for ascension by Lord Vauthry and were never to be seen again. Since I had no other relatives, or even any close friends to speak of, I was left alone in the world."
94,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_051","<sigh> A past like that hardly seems worth remembering, does it?"
95,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_060","Following the initial changes wrought by the release of water and earth, the Empty hath displayed no further signs of alteration."
96,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_061","Stability, some may call this and be satisfied, but in truth it is passivity. A passivity stemming from Light's ever-pervasive presence."

99,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_RYNE_000_064","So the primal would be...Ramuh, yes? From what I've heard, he's a guardian of the forest and not particularly keen on conflict. But you've actually fought him, haven't you?"

103,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_RYNE_000_065","Ah, yes. Thancred mentioned that he more closely resembles a person than a beast, unlike most other primals. And apparently he tends not to move about much."
104,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_RYNE_000_066","I wonder if the sylphs had anything to do with that? I hear they can be quite mischievous, much like the pixies of Il Mheg."

106,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_RYNE_000_068","Well, it's like you say. If we want to call forth an accurate representation of the primal, I should picture it in my mind as clearly as possible.

107,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_069","In order for this to work, we need to actually fly somewhere, yes? So rather than sitting in one spot while you exchange anecdotes, why don't you get this blasted thing moving first?"
108,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_070","One must admit, the suggestion is not without merit. Ryne, might I suggest the Gandof Thunder Plains as our next location?"
109,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_071","These plains, it is writ, were perpetually blanketed in storm clouds, the only source of illumination the ceaseless barrage of lightning. The ambient aether that lingereth there shall provide ideal conditions for the summoning."
110,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_RYNE_000_072","Then that's where we're heading. Come on, Eden, we've got a job to do!"

114,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_RYNE_000_080","All the lightning that's fallen here over the years has left the ground covered in craters. But don't worry, Eden will give you something more even to stand on."
115,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_THANCRED_000_081","Even if Ryne has done a good job of memorizing my description of Ramuh, it will likely make little difference to how he manifests. After all, it's your memories that shape the summoning, not hers."
116,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_082","The area is saturated with lightning-aspected aether, this I am able to confirm. In addition to the primal, be thou wary of stray bolts that may occur as a result of our activity."
117,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_083","I don't think I've ever been anywhere like this before. And I'm not sure I'd want to come back. Too dreary for my liking."
118,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_084","Would be nice if our next destination is a little cheerier, but I suppose I can't exactly choose if I want answers."
119,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_THANCRED_000_090","I had my eye on Gaia the entire time you were fighting Ramuh, and besides the sort of reaction you might expect from someone watching you take on a half-man, half-flying-horse thunder god, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary."
120,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_THANCRED_000_091","The fact that Eden itself also showed no signs of being affected by her presence can only be a good thing. But I'd understand if Gaia herself were more than a little disappointed that she's no closer to the answers she seeks."
121,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_092","Once again, 'twas a most superlative display of thy puissance. Now, I could not fail but notice─that body did belong to Ixion, fabled equine embodiment of lightning. Hast thou perchance encountered the beast?"
122,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_093","So that...thing was created based on your memories? Maybe there's a way we can use Eden to summon the faerie like that..."

128,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_112","I have to say, I'm not exactly prepared for wet weather. If Eden can control elements and so on, can't you tell it to send those clouds somewhere else?"
129,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_GAIA_000_113","Speaking of which, I'm not very impressed with its so-called powers. If changing yellow crystals to purple is the extent of its abilities, it's no surprise the faerie didn't bother showing up. I hope that whatever's next is more worthwhile."
130,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_114","Rather than influencing the ground beneath our feet, Eden hath brought change to the firmament above."
131,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_URIANGER_000_115","And yet 'tis clear that a more dynamic element is required for the natural cycle of precipitation and evaporation to be complete."

134,"TEXT_LUCKRA202_03788_THANCRED_000_118","It seems we have a plan. Let's not dwell too much on the effects of each individual element, and instead focus on seeing them all restored."
