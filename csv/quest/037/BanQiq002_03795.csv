※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_SEQ_01","Thanks in no small part to your aid in gathering resources for the excavation effort, Qitarl Natl and his Stewards are at last prepared to delve deeper into the tunnels of Hopl's Stopple. Alas, there is one small complication: the presence of an arcane ward preventing access to the inner chambers that is passable only by servants of Ox'Dalan, protector of the underworld. As all present ponder a suitable course of action, the Great Serpent of Ronka lets forth a great scree, no doubt seeking to impart wisdom to your band. Sadly, no one present is able to comprehend the meaning of the divine protector's words, leaving you no choice but to accompany Chaqurl Qhotl to Slitherbough to seek the aid of the one man who can.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

Valan gives cursory consideration to the Keeper of Whispers's wisdom before offering up a more practical solution to the problem at hand: to construct a talisman enchanted with the incantations that keep Slitherbough safe from the selfsame beasts that would make the Qitari explorers their next meal."

Now able to probe the depths of Hopl's Stopple without fear of being devoured by creatures of the darkness, the Stewards' excavation team begins their dig, but will they succeed in finding the stone tablets they seek? Chaqurl Qhotl can scarce contain his anticipation to learn what secrets might be unearthed."
4,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_SEQ_04","The Qitari rejoice as their excavation effort succeeds in exhuming the first Qitari stela: one of many great stone tablets on which is writ the sum total of the knowledge and history of their ancient race. The stone, however, has been weathered over the ages, obscuring key passages necessary to comprehend the writings in full. At the exhortation of the great serpent, the Qitari resolve to restore the tablets to the best of their ability. However, the missing text leaves many passages open for interpretation, and Qitarl Natl and his son Chaqurl Qhotl have differing views about the intended message. Seeking the wisdom of an impartial arbitrator, they turn to you..."

137,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_100_108","At the very least, this is the only one we encountered on our expedition. And yet, if it traveled here from somewhere to guide us in our efforts, it would not be unreasonable to assume that there are others where this one came from."
138,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_108","In truth, it appeared and spoke to us just as we stood before the shattered stone. I cannot help but believe it was conveying to us a message, just as its brethren guided us to these ancient tunnels."
139,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_109","Chaqurl and I pondered the matter, and we believe that we understand. The great serpent bids us to unearth what remains of the scattered and weathered stelae, and piece together our people's history anew with our own hands and minds."

141,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QUINFORT_000_111","Yet surely you must have been able to make out something from what remained of the stone! What chronicles of eld were writ there!?"
142,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_112","...Ahem. What we were able to make of the markings could be described thus: a mighty Ronso wearing a crown─no doubt meant to represent the first emperor of Ronka, stood tall with a blade raised high over his head."
143,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_113","Before him, cowered a Qitari─one of our forefathers, no doubt. The carving would seem to depict the momentous occasion that was the first encounter between our people and the empire."
144,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_114","And the implications could not be more clear. Doubtless our ancestors, ill-suited for battle, were conquered and subjugated by the might of Ronka, under whose yoke they would find new purpose as the stewards of history."
145,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_CHAQURLQHOTL_000_115","A most fascinating interpretation, Father. But if I might be so bold, I saw the drawings quite differently."
146,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_CHAQURLQHOTL_000_116","I do not believe the Ronkan emperor would be so cruel as to threaten the poor, weak Qitari. No, I believe that he found us vulnerable and at the mercy of the fearsome beasts of the forest. He slew the beasts by his own hand, and befriended our ancestors, giving us new purpose as his subjects."
147,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_117","Your optimism is admirable, my boy, but I fear that such a bright and cheery interpretation of events is unlikely at best. History is full of harsh truths from which we must not avert our eyes."
148,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_CHAQURLQHOTL_000_118","But tales are still sung of the first emperor's might and majesty to this day, are they not? I simply cannot fathom that he would be so cruel as to enslave our people!"
149,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_VALAN_000_119","If you ask me, both theories seem reasonable. But if you intend to keep a record of history to pass down to posterity, you're going to have to choose one."
