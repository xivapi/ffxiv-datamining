49,"TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_001","Luckily for them, I've come up with another one of my ingenious plans! We're going to fill Lyhe Mheg with water!"
50,"TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_002","That way, the children have the time of their lives, and we pixies will be able to splish and splash to our hearts' content without being pestered by those pesky Fuath."
51,"TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_003","All we need is an icewater undine heart. Once I've worked my magic on it, we'll have rivers and waterfalls galore! Naturally, you'll be the one collecting the heart, though I doubt its owner will be too happy to part with it. Don't worry, you <Emphasis>probably</Emphasis> won't be horribly killed!"
52,"TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_010","Did you manage to steal an icewater undine's heart? Literally, I mean."
53,"TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_011","Ooh, a fine specimen! With this, we can create all the water we need!"
54,"TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_012","Soon, Lyhe Mheg will be filled with the sounds of children's laughter as they splash and swim and drag each other into the depths, just like the Fuath! It's only a dream, so it's all perfectly safe, unless the rumor about “if you die in your dreams, you die in real life” is true...
I might have to check that at some point, actually."
