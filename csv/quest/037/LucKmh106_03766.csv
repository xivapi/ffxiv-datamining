61,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_026","I say “work,” but it is rather more a chore. I must clean my chambers here in Slitherbough from top to bottom. If you would be so kind as to go and fetch a broom from Asgeir, we might finish before Runar is done cooking."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_029","I require a broom if I'm to make any meaningful progress here. I'm sure you can find one if you speak with Asgeir."

64,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ASGEIR_000_031","I cannot imagine why she would have need of such a thing, but here you are. It is old but sturdy and sure to suffice."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ASGEIR_000_032","You don't suppose she might be cleaning, do you? ...Should we be concerned?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_040","I trust Asgeir was able to find a broom for us?"
67,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_041","Well worn. Good. This would prove difficult otherwise."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_042","Though I must say, I think I did rather well for not having a broom thus far."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_100_042","...Yes, well, you weren't buried beneath a veritable avalanche of books when you entered, were you? Right. Anyway, it is time I finished cleaning with the help of that broom."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_050","You didn't honestly think I'd do it the old-fashioned way? That broom is more than capable of sweeping by itself. Or rather, it will be... Ahem."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_051","Time to rise, to swish and sweep,
A tidy chamber you must keep.
To this task you shall be bound,
Until no dust is to be found."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_052","In this one particular respect, I've no objections to following in Master Matoya's footsteps."

75,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RUNAR_000_055","(-Runar-)M-Master Matoya! Pardon the interruption, but the stew is ready."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_056","Is something troubling you? You've been rather quiet."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RUNAR_000_057","N-No! Everything is fine, I assure you. It has been a long day, is all."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_058","I see..."

81,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_061","I was, though I'm sad to say I lost track of him shortly after entering these woods."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_062","He seems determined to traverse every ilm of Norvrandt in his quest to spread the truth of the Warriors of Light and the Flood."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_063","And it seems news of your address at the Crystarium precedes him at every destination, making his task all the more simple."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_064","It remains to be seen to what end he encourages the people to become Warriors of Light themselves..."
85,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_100_064","...But there is no denying that his words have struck a chord with many."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALISAIE_000_065","Well, we're all agreed that this is just another Ascian ploy, yes?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALISAIE_000_066","They've commandeered corpses before, and to no good end. I see no reason to think this time is any different─especially when it's that of a fallen Warrior of Light."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_067","I doubt we'll learn more if we remain a step behind."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_URIANGER_000_068","His next destination is, in all likelihood, Slitherbough..."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_069","Alisaie, are you certain you should be here?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALISAIE_000_070","If you're concerned about Halric and the others, you needn't be. Their treatment is going well, but progress is slow and exhausting─for all of us. The best thing I can do now is let them rest. So─I believe we were about to discuss how to arrange a meeting with our would-be Warrior of Light?"
92,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_071","Before visiting any towns or villages, Ardbert would hunt down and slay a nearby sin eater to earn the locals' trust."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_072","Our best chance of getting ahead of him is to find one before he does."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_URIANGER_000_073","Thankfully, Thancred and Ryne are returned from the Empty and have taken up the search."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_URIANGER_000_074","Ryne believeth one may lurk beneath the boughs of Woven Oath."
96,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_075","Then that is where we will start our search."
97,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RUNAR_000_076","Master Matoya!"
98,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RUNAR_000_077","I...er... A warm bowl of stew will be awaiting your return."
99,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_078","I look forward to it."
100,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RUNAR_000_080","Please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I beg of you... Keep her safe..."
101,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RYNE_000_081","I can sense no other sin eaters in the area. I hope this means Ardbert will be coming this way soon."
