49,"TEXT_BANPIX127_03715_UINNEE_000_001","Yet you...you have to tie a piece of wood to a tree branch and hope that it doesn't snap, dropping you to the ground and killing you instantly! All for the chance to go higher, and higher, and feel like you're about to take flight. But you won't! It's depressing, is what it is."

54,"TEXT_BANPIX127_03715_UINNEE_000_011","Oh, yes! This should be more than strong enough. I'll have to trick some mature mortals into testing it first, of course. Wouldn't want to risk the children! Once it's properly spun into the dream, maybe I'll even give it a try myself!"
