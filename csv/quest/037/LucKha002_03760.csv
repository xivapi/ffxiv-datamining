48,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_000","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, ever a sight for sore eyes! What brings you here this day? Are you come to see our progress, or perhaps to contribute to it?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_001","In any case, I owe you a debt of gratitude. Thanks to able and willing helpers such as your good self, the reconstruction effort proceeds apace. This court has fairly been reborn, I believe you will agree."
50,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_AUGEBERT_000_002","Oi, Francel. I've finished my checks, and everything looks to be order. That's that for the court, I reckon."
51,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_003","Glad am I to hear it. This is a momentous step in our project─one we could not have taken without the aid of Ishgardians and outsiders alike."
52,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_AUGEBERT_000_004","Aye. At last, we've got a flow of materials comin' in, along with the hands to put it all to use. It begins in earnest."
53,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_005","That it does, my friend. That it does."
54,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_006","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, Augebert. There is something I would ask of you."
55,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_007","I bid you commit to your mind's eye the Firmament as it is now."
56,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_008","When the last paving stone is laid, I would have you fully appreciate how much has been accomplished by the sweat of innumerable brows."
57,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_009","For though Ishgard may arrive at a brighter future, we must never forget the path we walked to get there, fraught with sorrow and sacrifice as it was."
58,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_010","If we do so, I fear we will lose our way again."
59,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_AUGEBERT_000_011","Heh, same old Francel, though, eh? Try to unclench that jaw of yours a little, lad, else you're liable to give yourself a fever and collapse like you used to."
60,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_012","Those days are long past, thank you very much!"
61,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_013","<sigh> Just...remember what I asked. And pray keep it private. 'Tis a personal request to the two of you."
62,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_AUGEBERT_000_014","Don't worry, you know I ain't no gossipmonger. Now then, if there's nothing else, I'll get back to it."
63,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_015","All right, my friend. Take care you do not overwork yourself, and tell the others the same."
64,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_016","Well, there you have it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. There will be a brief hiatus while we prepare for the next phase of construction. When all is in readiness, I shall make another announcement."
65,"TEXT_LUCKHA002_03760_FRANCEL_000_017","In the meantime, do rest and recover your strength. 'Twas good to see you again."
