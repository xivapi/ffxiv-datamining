※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS501_03722_SEQ_01","The celebrant Amh Garanjy wishes you a happy Starlight amidst a cheerful scene of families rejoicing amidst delightful decorations. There is, however, one child who is not feeling particularly festive: a boy by the name of Nalipponcque, who finds himself alone this eve despite a promise from his father─a bowman of the Gods' Quiver─that they would celebrate the holiday together. After the boy dejectedly wanders away, the celebrant muses that perhaps there is a way to return the smile to his face. To that end, she would have you visit one Piers at Quiver's Hold, that you might inquire as to the whereabouts of his colleague, the boy's father."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS501_03722_SEQ_02","You arrive at Quiver's Hold and explain the situation to Bowman Piers, who relates to you the circumstances by which his fellow quivermen have been recruited to perform in this year's Starlight concert. He explains that Lartonphe, in particular, is an accomplished vocalist who will be one of the stars of the show. The bowman surmises that his colleague has been sneaking off in secret from his son to rehearse for his performance, and encourages you to seek him out and share with him his son's concerns. At Piers's suggestion, you decide to make for Bentbranch Meadows, where the crooning quiverman means to reunite with his loyal chocobo."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS501_03722_SEQ_03","You arrive at Bentbranch Meadows, where Eylgar the stablehand informs you that Lartonphe departed just a few bells ago. He also mentions that he suggested that the quiverman take his chocobo companion for a walk by the gentle waters of the Jadeite Flood, in hopes of calming the bird's troubled heart. You resolve to venture that way yourself, and survey the surroundings to see if you cannot spot your quarry."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS501_03722_SEQ_04","At the Jadeite Flood, you are greeted by the sound of singing and chirping in the distance. Following your ear, you come upon Lartonphe and his feathered friend, who are practicing their singing on the shores of the Flood. As the quiverman tells it, the bird was not suffering from an ailment as he feared, but simply was stimulated by his voice, and anxious to join him in song and dance. He laments his own failures in causing his son grief during Starlight season, and resolves to make amends somehow. Man and chocobo then depart to prepare for the performance, but not before Lartonphe beseeches you to return to Amh Garanjy, and ask the celebrant to see to it that his son attends the concert."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS501_03722_SEQ_05","You return to Amh Garanjy and relate the details of your encounter with Lartonphe. She initially struggles to come up with a way to convince Nalipponcque to attend the festivities, until you volunteer the story of a certain singing and dancing chocobo. Convinced that nothing would make for a better Starlight gift to the boy than seeing his favorite bird take the stage with his father, the celebrant encourages you to return to Quiver's Hold and earnestly entreat the quiverman, while she sees to it that the boy does not wander off before the main event."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS501_03722_SEQ_06","You arrive at Quiver's Hold to find the ever-serious Lartonphe in the throes of a dilemma most dire. Though he wants nothing more than to give his boy a joyous memory for Starlight, he fears that by his deception he has already alienated the poor child beyond repair. Just when the poor man seems to have lost all hope, the two of you are joined by a most illustrious trio: Miah Molkot of the White Rams, Guildmaster Luciane, and Bowlord Lewin himself. They remind the querulous quiverman of his sworn duty to keep the Twelveswood at peace, and gently point out that going forward with his Starlight performance as promised is a vital part of this. The three illustrious archers offer to cooperate in whatever way they can, after which you provide the final spark of motivation he needs with your inspired proposal that he bring his chocobo companion on stage─a suggestion to which both man and bird eagerly agree. The matter settled to everyone's satisfaction, you set off for Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to report the triumphant news to Amh Garanjy."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS501_03722_SEQ_07","You return to town and speak with Amh Garanjy, who is delighted to hear that your efforts on her behalf have been a resounding success. Assuring you that all the preparations to begin the Starlight concert have been completed, she invites you to speak with her again whenever you are ready to raise the curtain on what is certain to be a performance to remember."
