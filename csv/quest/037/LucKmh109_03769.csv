0,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_SEQ_00","Thus reminded of the urgency of your investigation, Urianger would press on."
1,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_SEQ_01","Urianger suggests that you cut short your rest that the investigation into the undersea ruins might commence without further delay. This proposal meets with no resistance from Thancred or yourself, so the three of you depart forthwith for the Split Hull, where the remainder of your party awaits."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_SEQ_02","You join your companions at the Split Hull, and it is thankfully only a short while before your ancient guide appears overhead. All that remains now is to leap from the cliffs to Bismarck's back, and allow him to take you deep into the illuminated land, where secrets of the past yet slumber.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_SEQ_03","Fighting your way past a horde of hostile benthos, you cannot help but notice the astonishing number of forms stored within Anamnesis Anyder. Perhaps still more secrets of the ancients lie within the central chamber of Noesis─and with Rukshs Dheem vanquished, they are yours for the taking."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_SEQ_04","As you explore Noesis with your fellow Scions, an odd device activates of its own accord, conjuring the lifelike echoes of several ancient beings. This marvelous record of long-forgotten affairs shows them deep in conversation regarding the summoning of Hydaelyn, of all things, which was apparently spearheaded by a personage named “Venat.” Further prodding causes the device to divulge a single additional memory that reveals this Venat became Hydaelyn's heart─and Elidibus, Zodiark's."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_SEQ_05","An astonished Y'shtola attempts to reactivate the device that you might view further records, but unfortunately meets with no success. For want of further revelations, you are left confounded as to the true identity of Elidibus, who by rights should have long since ceased to be. The group trusts to Y'shtola to remain in Anamnesis Anyder and coax out more from the facility, while the rest of you return to keeping an eye on the wider world─or worlds, in your case."

49,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_URIANGER_000_000","Though our respite was cut short, I daresay we are all eager to avail ourselves of such knowledge as the ruins may hold."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_THANCRED_000_001","Aye, and I doubt further contemplation of Elidibus's machinations will be conducive to relaxation. We may as well make for the Split Hull now."

70,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_THANCRED_000_052","And there I was thinking “immortal” was bad. Would someone explain to me how we're meant to kill a being who doesn't technically exist?"

72,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_URIANGER_000_054","That this facility shared intimate ties with the Akadaemia Anyder may readily be discerned from the common element in their names.

73,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_URIANGER_000_055","Yet...such procedural minutiae are of largely academic interest, I concede. 'Tis unto the parties which did frequent these institutions that our thoughts should rightly turn. Specifically, the followers of Venat, and the Convocation of Fourteen..."

78,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_YSHTOLA_000_061","No response. Confound it."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_URIANGER_000_062","If I may, milady─the panel did formerly emit a soft-yet-perceptible glow. That it doth so no longer may betoken the depletion of some essential energy within."

83,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_URIANGER_000_066","This calleth to mind a truth that Emet-Selch did once reveal in passing─that the names by which we know our foes are not those given to Ascians at birth. Rather, they are titles of office, afforded to individuals of merit at such time as the role becometh vacant."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_URIANGER_000_067","Perchance the Elidibus at Zodiark's heart and the emissary with whom we are acquainted be not one and the same, but predecessor and successor."

88,"TEXT_LUCKMH109_03769_YSHTOLA_000_071","I will remain for a time. I would not abandon my attempts to revive the device so soon. There is more to learn here─I can feel it."
