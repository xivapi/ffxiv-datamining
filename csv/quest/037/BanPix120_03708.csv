55,"TEXT_BANPIX120_03708_UINNEE_000_023","And when she could fight no more, we pixies turned her into a tree! So that she could live on, form as grand and beautiful as her spirit. I'm sure she appreciated it. Otherwise, why would she bloom so brightly?"
56,"TEXT_BANPIX120_03708_UINNEE_000_024","Never you mind all of that, though. We have flowers to plant and dreams to spin!"
