1,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_01","Following a brief bout of contemplation and postulation, Urianger arrives at the conclusion that in order to complete the cycle of rainfall and evaporation in the Empty, the elements of wind and fire must be restored simultaneously. Naturally, this means that the burden on Ryne and yourself will in effect be doubled, as you attempt to draw forth and meld the two contrasting types of aether. Not to be deterred, you both accept the challenge, though as Thancred points out, the increased strain will require you to be well rested before embarking on your next voyage. Gaia, impatient as always, storms off, while Ryne ponders over what might be troubling her."
2,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_02","Despite your best efforts to engage Ryne in conversation, she is reluctant to respond. Perhaps all she needs is someone to /rally her spirits."
3,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_03","Ryne explains that she has been worried about Gaia's well-being since before she awakened from her long slumber. Having been raised in isolation, Ryne has precious little experience in speaking with people of a similar age, and she is unsure as to how to approach Gaia. Given what the pair have in common, it seems reasonable to expect that they would be well matched as friends, although Gaia's sullen demeanor makes even approaching her somewhat daunting. Thancred encourages Ryne to take the first step and initiate conversation, while the rest of you silently observe the exchange from just within earshot."
4,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_04","Ryne overcomes her initial anxiousness and engages Gaia in some light small talk. Unfortunately, this is met with a less-than-favorable response, with Gaia expressing her distaste for Ryne's positive outlook before turning on her heels and making her way to Eden's core. Taking this as a cue, Urianger suggests that now would be the opportune moment to commence the next phase of the plan."
5,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_05","Urianger has selected Ashfall as the next location, once known for its searing heat and relentless winds. You conjure the images of Ifrit and Garuda while Ryne calls forth the necessary aether to give form to your memories, although some doubt lingers over Ryne's ability to focus on the task at hand. Putting such fears to one side, all that remains is for you to vanquish two raging primals at the same time. What could be simpler?

6,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_06","Having survived the combined assault of the reimagined deities of fire and wind, you return triumphant to Eden's core. Ryne is already preparing to pilot Eden back to the camp in order to properly assess the effect that your victory has had on the ambient aether of the Empty."
7,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_07","Torrential rain pours down on the vicinity of your camp, though you and your companions are content to stand in the open as it leaves you all drenched through. While Ryne is clearly delighted by the results, Gaia's mood darkens and she launches into a tirade aimed at Eden itself, before clutching her head and making nonsensical utterances. She eventually returns to her senses, but it seems that her inner turmoil has only temporarily subsided."

155,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_THANCRED_000_132","Ryne's looking a bit down in the doldrums, but you let me worry about that. We can't allow anything to interfere with whatever goes on in your mind when summoning those primals."
156,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_GAIA_000_133","Not you as well? Look, I've had enough small talk to last me a lifetime, so don't even bother. I believe you have a job to do, yes? Then be quick about it."
157,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_URIANGER_000_140","To defeat the deiform manifestations of both wind and fire shall require every last mote of thy strength. That thou hast triumphed over such beings in previous encounters should be at the forefront of thy mind as we commence the summoning."
158,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_141","Where are we going this time, Urianger?"
159,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_URIANGER_000_142","The place called Ashfall doth satisfy our requirements, I believe. The fables speak of travelers sweltering beneath the blazing heat of the midday sun, while after nightfall, slicing winds did tear at their cloaks."
160,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_143","Hmm... I see. Hopefully it won't be quite that bad when I draw out the elements."
161,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_URIANGER_000_144","Ryne, my dear. May I remind thee that to focus is not the same as to deny other thoughts. Whatsoever it is that troubleth thee, thou wouldst be better for acknowledging it."
162,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_145","Yes, you're right, of course... It's Gaia that I'm worried about."
163,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_URIANGER_000_146","That is well. May thy concern for her lend thee yet more strength."
164,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_147","It's time. I'll begin drawing out wind and fire in equal measure."
165,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_148","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, we'll only get one chance at this, so let's make it count!"

167,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_150","If we summon two primals at once, maybe they'll fight each other? That way, you'll only need to beat the one left standing. But I suppose it defeats the purpose of it if you don't take them both down at the same time."

169,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_URIANGER_000_152","My studies indicate that no equivalent of Garuda's servants, the Ixal, are present here on the First. My hypothesis as to the reason why can perhaps wait till another time."
170,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_GAIA_000_153","I wonder what sort of hellish beasts you've conjured up this time?"
171,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_THANCRED_000_160","Combining the contrasting powers of different primals... That seems an awful lot like the Ultima Weapon. In any case, I'm pleased to see that you were as successful here as you were at the Praetorium."
172,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_URIANGER_000_161","That two such ferocious beings should meld into a single entity is frightful indeed. Further research must needs be performed to fully comprehend this unexpected phenomenon."
173,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_GAIA_000_162","For a moment, I thought Ryne had lost control of the aether. Luckily, we managed to avoid any major disasters, from what I can tell."
174,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_170","That was incredible! I never imagined they would fuse together like that, but you took them down all the same."
175,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_171","I suppose the main thing is that we're now two elements closer to restoring the aether of the Empty. Let's go and see what difference it's made!"
176,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_RYNE_000_180","It actually worked! Just like Urianger said it would!"
