1,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_SEQ_01","With Northerlies now part of your collection of spells, Martyn is eager to have you demonstrate the proper form and technique of a blue mage to P'yandih and Nutiba Buntiba. The two apprentices eagerly await your arrival in Hammerlea, where the lesson is to be held, though exactly what skills you are expected to impart has yet to be explained."
2,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_SEQ_02","Shortly after reaching Hammerlea, Martyn reveals that you will be engaging a mammet borrowed from the Celestium in combat, in order to show the students the practical applications of blue magic. Your self-proclaimed mentor gives you a moment to collect your thoughts before he activates the adorable-yet-deadly axe-wielding automaton."
3,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_SEQ_03","The arena viking's slow, deliberate swings prove no match for your swift and precise blue magic spells, and before long, the mammet lies motionless at your feet. Martyn, however, is visibly distraught by the sight of the expensive machine being rendered inoperable, since he will no doubt have to find the coin to pay for its repairs."
4,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_SEQ_04","Nutiba Buntiba and P'yandih observe that your nimble footwork and relentless barrage of attacks were the deciding factors in your victory, and it seems that a valuable lesson has been learned. With the demonstration having reached its conclusion, Martyn leads the way back to Ul'dah."
5,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_SEQ_05","At the Blue Mages' Guild, you learn that not only is Martyn charging his apprentices for his tuition, but that the demonstration that you provided actually set them back more than the usual amount. He claims that this is a means to an end, as their contributions are required for the day-to-day running of the guild. Perhaps in a somewhat hurried attempt to change the subject, he approaches the topic of the various roles that adventurers fulfill when forming groups to go exploring. Normally, the members divide their duties between offense, defense, and healing, whereas in the blue mage's case, it is possible for them to perform all of these duties simultaneously. In fact, there have been several reports of parties comprised entirely of blue mages meeting with considerable success on such quests. Martyn is keen to investigate this further, in the hopes he will be able to prove the effectiveness of his guild's members in real combat situations. In the meantime, he requests that you prepare for the next lesson with Nutiba Buntiba and P'yandih by mastering Whistle, a spell which he presumably already possesses himself.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 55 and learning Whistle."

51,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_001","And like I mentioned before, I want you to help me train a couple of fledglin' blue mages. Remember the pair who were practically beggin' you to teach them? It looks like they'll finally get their wish. I'll meet you over in Hammerlea."
52,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_LATOOLJA_000_005","Latool Ja thinks Martyn is letting power go to his head. Soon, it will be too big for his little blue hat!"

55,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_010","Normally, gettin' these two to do any serious trainin' is a bloody uphill struggle, but as soon as I mentioned you'd be comin' along, they couldn't get here fast enough."
56,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_011","I thought they should see some practical blue magic, away from all the showmanship of the Masked Carnivale, so I borrowed this arena viking for you to demonstrate a few spells. Go easy on it, though, eh? I've got to give it back, you see."

79,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_047","More importantly, somethin' else has come to my attention."
80,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_048","My apprentices ain't the only ones who go off lookin' for enemies to test their skills on. As everyone knows, adventurers often band together and go delvin' into abandoned catacombs, haunted mansions and the like. They'll normally decide beforehand who does what, accordin' to their areas of expertise."
81,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_049","One to lead the way and draw out the beasties, a couple more for general stabbin', burnin', and so on, and maybe someone to see to any mangled limbs and gapin' wounds. In other words, they all have a certain role to fill."
82,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_050","But when I heard that groups of blue mages had been doin' just as well without specializin' in any particular role, I was thrilled to bits! Why? Because this can only mean one thing:"

85,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_053","'Course, we knew that already, but I'd never thought about usin' blue magic outside of one-to-one combat. I've asked the guild members to write a report each time they go explorin' as a group, so I can formulate new strategies for workin' alongside others."
86,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_054","Even P'yandih and Nutiba Buntiba might have somethin' interestin' to tell me next time we meet. Mind you, those two have taken to blue magic like cats...and popotoes to water. Not very well, in other words. That's why I'll be takin' them for more trainin', and I'd like you to join us."
87,"TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_000_055","Until then, I want you to learn to Whistle! Not the “put your lips together and blow” sort, I mean the blue magic spell. Now go, my annoyingly capable apprentice!"
