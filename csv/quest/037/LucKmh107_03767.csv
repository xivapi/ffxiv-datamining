91,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_SYSTEM_000_050","On cursory sniff, you detect the faint aroma of fresh oranges, a far cry from the rather memorable scent of mnyiri liver."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_SYSTEM_000_051","Thrusting your hand into each sack in turn, you find that all are filled with wheat down to the bottom. You also find that raw wheat is unpleasantly pointy."

96,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_THANCRED_000_054","Perhaps you've deduced this already, but it seems the benthos have been raiding Kholusian storehouses as well as those of the Ondo."

103,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_URIANGER_000_064","To venture ashore and steal from the Kholusians entaileth unconscionable risk. Yet there is no denying the truth of our eyes."

107,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_THANCRED_000_072","We also found all manner of foodstuffs from Kholusia in the Flounders' Floor. Tell me, Tolshs Aath, does that seem odd to you?"
108,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_073","It is brazen, to be sure..."
109,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_ALPHINAUD_000_074","I'm reminded of rumors I've heard recently concerning a rash of thefts from Kholusian warehouses. The perpetrators enter in the dead of night and are gone before anyone has realized what has happened."

111,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_ALPHINAUD_000_076","Perhaps the reason they have struggled so is that their quarry is of the sea..."
112,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_YSHTOLA_000_077","The true question, then, is what we mean to do about it. Much as I would like to proceed to the ruins without further delay, we cannot allow the benthos to carry on as they are."
113,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_078","If I may─I believe that the ruins are, in fact, key to the benthos' plans."

115,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_080","These ruins, which lie deep within the illuminated land, are a recent discovery."
116,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_081","We have seen signs that the benthos are preparing to claim them with all haste. We could not fathom why, but in light of the knowledge that they have been stockpiling resources..."
117,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_082","It is clear that their queen will sssoon give birth."
118,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_083","They require space to raise their young, and food for both queen and hatchlings to thrive."
119,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_YSHTOLA_000_084","Well, we can hardly fault them for that."
120,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_085","Under normal circumstances, perhapsss. But conditions in the Tempest are far from suitable for spawning, its resources barely able to sustain our current population. There is only one reason they would disregard this."
121,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_086","They seek to build an army, and with it take revenge upon the finless."
122,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_087","It is not a surprise. They came to us not long ago, seeking allies for the cause. We rebuffed them, of course─the suffering of others will not serve as balm to their own. Their queen, however, desires only bloodshed, and will gladly send her children to die in our stead."

125,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_YSHTOLA_100_089","I doubt that this can be resolved without violence, but perhaps with a show of force we can convince them to see reason before the die is cast."
126,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_YSHTOLA_000_090","I would rather not risk your people in the attempt. If we travel to the illuminated land, is there a way we might identify the ruins ourselves?"

128,"TEXT_LUCKMH107_03767_TOLSHSAATH_000_092","That you have come to us now is the will of the ancient ones. They have guided you here that you may drive out the usurpers─those who seek to use their magnificent creations with vile purpose."
