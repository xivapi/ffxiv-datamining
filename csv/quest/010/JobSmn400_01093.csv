1,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_SEQ_01","As a member of the Sons of Saint Coinach, Y'mhitra has access to records that allowed her to narrow down her search for the mystery assailant. Though she uncovered little more than an outdated military registration and a name─Tristan─the researcher was also able to track down one of the man's old war comrades. Travel to Little Ala Mhigo, and speak with the former Immortal Flame."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_SEQ_02","You have survived the ambush sprung upon you by the former soldier in Little Ala Mhigo. Return to Apkallu Falls and speak with Y'mhitra."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_SEQ_03","Though your inquiries in Little Ala Mhigo were met with nothing but misguided hostility, you nevertheless learn that Tristan is aware of your efforts to track him. Y'mhitra apologizes for her mistaken evaluation of the dangerous summoner, and bids you continue to improve in the art of summoning.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon reaching level 45."

49,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_001","We knew that our assailant was capable of summoning Ifrit-Egi, so I perused the records of past expeditions for those who claimed to have triumphed against the Lord of the Inferno."
50,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_002","Of these victorious primal hunters, there were eight names listed as “present whereabouts unknown.” After eliminating unlikely candidates based on race and gender, I was left with but a single name: Tristan."
51,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_003","Assuming the records are accurate, this Hyur was once registered as a soldier in the Immortal Flames. As to how the man came by his skills as a summoner, or why he sought to kill us, however, I remain woefully ignorant."
52,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_004","Nevertheless, I have witnessed him use the art of summoning for casual brutality, and that I cannot countenance. This power should never be employed for the sake of tyranny or personal gain; it was meant to oppose such evils."
53,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_005","It is our responsibility to bring this Tristan to justice. Should we stand idle, his reprehensible actions could very well stain the good name of future summoners who have yet to answer their calling. The art itself could be outlawed: the very mention of it, taboo."
54,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_006","Now, through my inquiries I was able to determine that a war comrade from Tristan's days in the military resides in Little Ala Mhigo. I ask that you pay a visit to this former soldier, and learn what he knows of our callous villain."
55,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_SENYOU_000_010","Well, well, seems like Tristan wasn't telling tall tales, after all. He said I could expect some primal-addled sod to show up and start asking questions."
56,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_SENYOU_000_011","Why don't you stay here and “play” with some friends of mine─I've a message to deliver. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She's<Else/>He's</If> all yours, ladies!"
57,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_020","You were set upon!? The fiend is one step ahead of us..."
58,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_021","I'd wager ten years of dig site findings that Tristan “warned” his old allies long before you set foot in that settlement. They thought you one of the tempered─a mortal in thrall to a primal's will."
59,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_022","In addition to being ruthless, it appears that our opponent is highly intelligent...and not quite as deranged as I first assumed."
60,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_023","Such a level of planning hints at the existence of some greater scheme. But that is still all we know. For the moment, we must be content with the knowledge that he perceives us as a threat and is aware of our efforts to track him."
61,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_024","Speaking of which, you did exceedingly well to survive the trap into which I blithely sent you."
62,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_025","I must apologize for my carelessness─I will not underestimate this man again. On a happier note, however, my efforts to decipher the Allagan texts proceed apace. Here, you must read this."
63,"TEXT_JOBSMN400_01093_YMHITRA_000_026","With your skills already tried and tested against the egi, you should have little difficulty in mastering a secondary summoning technique such as this. Let us put this day's disaster behind us, and focus on the wonders that lie ahead!"
