0,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_SEQ_00","Jenlyns wishes to bid you farewell."
1,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_SEQ_01","Although his captaincy is a sham, Jenlyns has decided that he will use what power he has to strike back at the cabal. For the showdown, he has chosen Snowcloak in Coerthas─but before you can offer your assistance, he commands you to stay away and find a safe haven. Jenlyns also mentions that Solkzagyl wishes to speak with you, and the captain directs you to a tunnel in central Thanalan where Solkzagyl will be waiting."
2,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_SEQ_02","Solkzagyl states plainly that Jenlyns will die if he faces the Monetarists' assassins alone, and he all but declares his intention to follow Jenlyns to Snowcloak before departing. What you do next is up to you and your conscience."
3,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_SEQ_03","When you arrive at the battleground that Jenlyns has chosen to launch his campaign against the cabal, you find him and Solkzagyl facing off against the minions of the Monetarists. Together, the three of you manage to defeat the assassins and deal the Monetarists a crushing blow. Afterwards, despite the captain's objections, Solkzagyl leaves the Sultansworn in Jenlyns's hands and returns to his paladin's journey. Return to Ul'dah, find Jenlyns at his station near the Royal Promenade in the Hustings Strip, and talk to him once more."
4,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_SEQ_04","As Solkzagyl continues to search for the fabled Oathkeeper, Jenlyns will continue to serve Ul'dah as one of the Sultansworn. In recognition of your deeds, he bestows upon you the gallant surcoat, sacred armor normally reserved for the most courageous of the Sultansworn. Although this is a violation of long-standing tradition, he believes there is no paladin more deserving of the honor. Wear your new armor with pride, free paladin, and continue to defend the people of Eorzea.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Jenlyns once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"

49,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_JENLYNS_000_001","After our encounter in the hills, I spent some time in the care of Solkzagyl, recovering from my wounds. As I convalesced, he gave me the true account of what happened these last few years in his solitary war against the Monetarists."

51,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_JENLYNS_000_003","They planted the lie that Solkzagyl was a traitor, and tricked me into tracking him down. I was their puppet, twitching obediently at the end of the strings they pulled."

53,"TEXT_JOBPLD500_01060_JENLYNS_000_005","Solkzagyl was no traitor, as I should well have known. But I allowed myself to be deceived by the whispers of mummers and flatterers, and...
