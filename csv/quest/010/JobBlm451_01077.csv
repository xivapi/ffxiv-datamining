1,"TEXT_JOBBLM451_01077_SEQ_01","Da Za tells you that he set out from his kobold homeland of O'Ghomoro to pursue the same legend recounted by Kazagg Chah and Dozol Meloc. He holds a stone tablet passed down to him from his ancestor Da Gu. Upon showing it to you, the light from your Gem of Shatotto reveals writing carved into its surface indicating that closing the voidgate requires certain <Emphasis>garb</Emphasis>. To locate three of the pieces, pour the blood of Kazagg Chah into the planar fissure at the Zanr'ak encampment in southern Thanalan, the blood of Dozol Meloc into the planar fissure at the Ixali logging grounds in the North Shroud, and the blood of Da Za into the planar fissure at O'Ghomoro in outer La Noscea."

Travel to Thal's Respite in eastern Thanalan, investigate the planar fissure that has opened there, and procure the blood of any fiends that emerge from it."

5,"TEXT_JOBBLM451_01077_SEQ_05","You have obtained the fourth piece of wizard's garb. Take word of your accomplishment to Kazagg Chah at Burgundy Falls in eastern Thanalan."
6,"TEXT_JOBBLM451_01077_SEQ_06","You learn from Kazagg Chah that a fifth piece of wizard's garb yet remains, and that its location is a mystery. The only clue the ancient tablet gives is that the body armor rests in the <Emphasis>Solace of the Gods</Emphasis>. The Amalj'aa black mage tells you he will continue researching the matter. In the meantime, carry on with your studies, and make preparations to seal the voidgate once and for all.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Kazagg Chah upon reaching level 50."

53,"TEXT_JOBBLM451_01077_DAZA_000_005","It was one hundred years ago that a kobold first deciphered the legend─decrypted, decoded, deciphered. The great mage who did it was my own ancestor, 1st Order Patriarch Da Gu. Yes, yes, my very own."
54,"TEXT_JOBBLM451_01077_DAZA_000_006","But he broke kobold law. The first patriarch must never leave O'Ghomoro. No, no, never. But leave he did. He set out from La Noscea to pursue this legend. And for that he was named traitor─betrayer, turncloak, traitor."
55,"TEXT_JOBBLM451_01077_DAZA_000_007","None were drawn to the words of Da Gu. No, no, not a single kobold soul. They ignored his words. But when first I heard them, I felt strange─peculiar, odd, strange."
