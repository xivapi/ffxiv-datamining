1,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_SEQ_01","Luciane informs you that the legendary archer-turned-bard, Jehantel the Godsbow, has recently returned to the Twelveswood. Aspiring to transcendent mastery of the bow, several members of the Gods' Quiver have presented themselves as pupils to the legend. Alas, all have returned disappointed, as Jehantel offers only to teach poetry and verse. If you would learn from the man nonetheless, make your way west of Quarrymill in the South Shroud, where he is said to have made his camp."
2,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_SEQ_02","Having exchanged pleasantries with Jehantel, you astonish the kindly old bard by taking him up on his offer to teach you poetry and verse. He excitedly instructs you to present yourself to a moogle named Pukno Poki, who can often be found in an area situated east of Quarrymill."
3,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_SEQ_03","Speaking with Pukno Poki, the moogle prevails upon you to recover a stolen charm that was meant for Jehantel. The thief was last seen fleeing to the east of Quarrymill towards Takers' Rot."
4,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_SEQ_04","You have succeeded in reclaiming the stolen charm. Return it to Pukno Poki, who is likely in the last place you saw him, to the south of Takers' Rot."
5,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_SEQ_05","You show the charm to Pukno Poki. Impressed by your resourcefulness, the moogle requests that you deliver the strangely shaped crystal to Jehantel in his camp to the west of Quarrymill."
6,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_SEQ_06","You deliver both Pukno Poki's message and the charm to Jehantel. The legendary archer explains to you that the item you recovered is known as the Soul of the Bard. Jehantel bids you embrace your new calling, and become a bard who exceeds even Pukno Poki's wildest expectations.

※The next bard quest will be available from Jehantel upon reaching level 35."

49,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_002","Their reappearance calls to my mind the Battle of Griffin Crossing. Well, I say “Battle”─most are agreed that “Massacre” would be rather more apt.

50,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_003","A humiliating episode in our history, to be sure, but heavens forbid that we ever forget it. Failure is the finest─if not the kindest─of teachers, and few things drive a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> better than its sting."
51,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_004","Ah, but do let's speak of cheerier matters. Mayhap you've already heard, but a renowned archer has recently returned to the Twelveswood─the one they call the “Godsbow.”"
52,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_005","That's just a title, of course. His birthname is Jehantel, and he was once of the Gods' Quiver. The man was a legend even then, and there was no honor greater than being taken under his tutelage."
53,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_006","But that's not all there is to him, mind you. Jehantel was also a skilled bard, one of the rare few capable of inspiring others to great feats through song."
54,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_007","Upon learning that the Godsbow had returned, dozens of us flocked to him in hopes of training under a legend, yours truly included."
55,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_008","Alas, the meetings haven't unfolded quite as we had hoped. Jehantel has refused to teach each and every suitor that has approached him thus far."
56,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_009","Though, it should be mentioned that the topics he is reluctant to instruct us in do not include poetry and song. He seems <Emphasis>exceedingly</Emphasis> keen to teach us all about <Emphasis>them</Emphasis>. Some few of us were tempted to take him up on the offer...save that we have a nation to defend."
57,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_010","Far be it from my intent to belittle all those bards out there, but I like my chances rather better charging into battle with a quiver than a harp. <sigh> And here we were hoping that transcendent mastery of the bow might be ours..."
58,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_011","Hm? By the sparkle in your eyes, I'd wager you have an interest in that selfsame poetry and song. Come now, there is no call for shyness, and there <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> more to life than battle. If you would present yourself as a pupil to Jehantel, I happen to know his whereabouts."
59,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_012","I'm given to understand that he has made his camp somewhere west of Quarrymill in the South Shroud. Jehantel is an agreeable sort of fellow, and should be willing enough to meet with you."
60,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_LUCIANE_000_013","Truth be told, I'm still holding on to hope. If you could find a way into Jehantel's confidence, mayhap he can yet be persuaded to train us."

63,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_JEHANTEL_000_021","Naught gives us elderly folk more pleasure than the company of the young. Add to that a steaming pot of tea and the beauty of the Twelveswood, and we could want for little more!"
64,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_JEHANTEL_000_022","Ah. But the curl of your lip tells me that tea and scenery are not what you desire. You seek knowledge of archery, I take it? In which case, I'm afraid I must disappoint you...<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, was it?"
65,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_JEHANTEL_000_023","Yes, yes, I am Jehantel, the one they called the Godsbow─but that was in another life. I have long cast aside my bow, taking instead a harp to my breast. For years, I have lived as a bard, going wherever the wind blows, exulting in the beauty of creation through song."
66,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_JEHANTEL_000_024","To be sure, I still have the eyes to recognize a promising archer when I see one. And you, young one, have promise. Keep your nose to the grindstone, and one day you may count yourself a virtuoso of the bow."
67,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_JEHANTEL_000_025","Yet know that virtuosity is worthless without virtue. Aye, the words of the Ballad of the Vainglorious Fool tell us this much."
68,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_JEHANTEL_000_026","...You truly wish to remain and learn poetry and verse? Well, well, well...I must admit to being rather taken aback."
69,"TEXT_JOBBRD300_01085_JEHANTEL_000_027","In uncertain days such as these, there are few indeed who would devote their time to song as opposed to more “tangible” endeavors."
