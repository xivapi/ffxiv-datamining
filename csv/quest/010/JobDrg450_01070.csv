1,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_01","Much to Ser Alberic's surprise, the fugitive Estinien has initiated contact, saying that he has an important matter to discuss with the two of you. Travel to Boulder Downs and await his arrival at the designated rendezvous point."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_02","Estinien explains that he did not steal the Eye out of treachery, but rather to spare Ishgard from Nidhogg's wrath when the great wyrm returns. Upon realizing that you have been chosen as a second Azure Dragoon, he proposes that the two of you slay the ancient dragon together. Return to the Observatorium and speak with Ser Alberic for instructions on how to procure the armor necessary for the task."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_03","Ser Alberic explains that you must earn your drachen armor as the Azure Dragoons before you did─by trial. Travel to the Ogre's Belly and seek out Ser Brucemont."
4,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_04","You have passed the first trial. Speak with Ser Brucemont and obtain your reward."

7,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_07","Yet another challenge awaits you. Advance further within the cavern and speak with Ser Brucemont."
8,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_08","You have triumphed over the third trial set to you. Speak again with Ser Brucemont."
9,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_09","You have obtained the third piece of the set of drachen armor. Return to the Observatorium and tell Ser Alberic of your success."
10,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_10","Ser Alberic informs you that one final trial awaits you. Travel to the graveyard northwest of the Steel Vigil, blow a single note with the flute provided to you, and see to the visitor that arrives."
11,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_11","You have slain a mighty dragon of the Dravanian Horde and claimed its skull. Present it to Ser Alberic as proof of your victory."
12,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_12","Upon receiving the skull, Ser Alberic offers congratulations and presents you with the fourth piece of drachen armor. Though the fifth piece remains beyond your grasp, the old dragoon assures you of your readiness to complete your training. However, he would ask you to reaffirm your commitment before proceeding. If you are truly prepared to embark with Estinien to do battle with the great wyrm Nidhogg, speak with Ser Alberic once more."

49,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_001","As to his true intentions, I cannot say. It may well be a trap, but we must go nonetheless. I trust I can count upon your company."

51,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_011","Estinien, end this folly at once! You must know that each second the Eye passes outside Ishgard's walls brings us closer to a repeat of the tragedy of twenty summers past. Surrender yourself and the Eye, and return with me to Ishgard before it is too late."
52,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_012","Ah, but it is <Emphasis>already</Emphasis> too late, Master. For you see, Nidhogg has already awakened."

54,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_014","Hear me, Master: you have mistaken the cause of the dragons' return─the Eye is not to blame."
55,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_015","A premonition came to me by virtue of the dragon within, warning me that the great wyrm would soon rouse."
56,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_016","Even as he slumbered, Nidhogg seethed with irrepressible rancor for that wound of twenty years ago. That rancor will send him flying as a speeding arrow to Ishgard, whereupon death and devastation will ensue."
57,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_017","But there is a possible solution: were the Eye taken to a remote land, far from the Holy See─then, and only then, could destruction be averted and the lives of innocent Ishgardians be spared."
58,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_018","Y-You mean to make a bait of yourself!?
...Nay, there is more to this than you let on. You seek vengeance for Ferndale."

60,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_020","Dragons long outlive men and do not soon forget the wrongs done them. What grudge they harbor burns as a fire in their hearts, over time swelling into an unquenchable inferno. You need only look back on history to see that Nidhogg grows stronger with each awakening."
61,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_021","When last he darkened our skies, the great wyrm came within a hair's breadth of laying waste to Ishgard. Naught short of death will prevent him from completing his mission when next he wakes. Nidhogg took everything from me─now I shall take everything from him, even if it means my life."
62,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_022","The Eye works in ways men can ill comprehend, but this much is plain: in choosing two Azure Dragoons in one generation, it means for us to join together in common cause."
63,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_023","Adventurer. You have heard my resolution. Now I ask that you lend me your power─aye, the power of the dragon."
64,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_024","In the long and proud history of Ishgard, never before have two Azure Dragoons arisen in the same era to fight as one. This is our best─nay, our <Emphasis>only</Emphasis>─chance to send the great wyrm to eternal slumber."
65,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_025","Behold my armor. This is the drachen mail, forged in the lifeblood of dragons. As blood calls to blood, so too does the armor call to the dragon within, redoubling the wearer's strength thereby. If you would realize your potential as an Azure Dragoon, you must needs clad yourself in the same."
66,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_026","Clad so, you will inherit the technique passed from Azure Dragoon to Azure Dragoon down through the generations. Then─and only then─will your training be complete."
67,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_027","But first, you must win the drachen mail as I and Ser Alberic did before you, by proving yourself worthy in the ultimate trial of the Azure─a series of battles so harrowing as to send the unworthy to an early demise."
68,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_028","Master. Once the adventurer acquires the armor, pray see to it that <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> learns to harness the power of the dragon in full."

73,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_041","F-Forgive me. I was deep in thought. Now then, as to acquiring the armor of which Estinien spoke..."
74,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_042","At first, it was my intention to bequeath mine own armor to you. I am an Azure Dragoon no longer, and its powers are wasted on me. It would be simple enough to hand it over to you and complete your training right here and now."
75,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_043","But it is as Estinien said: the drachen armor is no ordinary set of mail. Its strength derives from the dragon blood whence it came, the blood's power resonating with the soul of the wearer."
76,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_044","Though I can no longer draw upon mine own armor's power, its bond to me was forged years ago. Were I to bestow it on you now, I fear it would offer but a scintilla of the protection it afforded me in those bygone days."
77,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_045","Aye, Estinien has the right of it: you must claim your armor as he and I did before you. You must complete the trials of the Azure, that the powers of dragon blood be yours and yours alone."
78,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_046","The Ogre's Belly will be where your final test begins. I shall dispatch Ser Brucemont there. Seek him out upon your arrival."
79,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_BRUCEMONT_000_050","You have grown strong since we last met, adventurer, but you pale in comparison with your Azure forebears. If you would prove me wrong, let your lance do the talking."
80,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_BRUCEMONT_000_055","Once again, adventurer, you prove yourself worthy beyond my expectations. Take this, but know that your trial has only just begun."

82,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_HEUSTIENNE_000_060","You, a foreigner, would don the drachen armor? Then prove to us that you will not do it dishonor!"
83,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_HEUSTIENNE_000_065","Ser Alberic said the Eye had chosen you, and it would appear he speaks true. The armor is yours─wear it with pride and honor."
84,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_HEUSTIENNE_000_066","Your trial is nigh complete, but be forewarned: many before you have made it this far, only to fall at the final challenge. Do not let overconfidence be your downfall."
85,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_BRUCEMONT_000_070","So you have made it this far. Very well. Prove yourself worthy of the Azure, or die in the effort!"
86,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_BRUCEMONT_000_075","You have demonstrated your powers to me beyond a doubt─aye, there is not an Ishgardian who would gainsay your right to don the armor of dragons."
87,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_BRUCEMONT_000_076","I shall send word ahead to Ser Alberic that you have passed your trials here. It is he who will present you with the fourth piece of armor, and consummate your training. Go now, my fellow dragoon, and deliver this land from the great wyrm's wrath."
88,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_080","I hear from Ser Brucemont that you performed most impressively. Yes, I stand more convinced than ever that you will be the one to save our land. Yet be warned, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>: one last trial awaits you."
89,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_081","You will face this trial in the presence not of knights, but of ghosts. Make your way toward the Steel Vigil, and seek out a gravestone north and west of the structure."
90,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_082","Take with you this flute, and when you reach your destination, blow a single strong note. A visitor shall soon arrive. Entertain your guest, and should he leave behind a present, return it here to me."

92,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_091","Ah, the skull of Greywine, old warrior of the Dravanian Horde. It's said that in ages past, he could bring down a castle with a single breath. His strength has dwindled since those days, but a dragon past his prime is a formidable foe nonetheless. In slaying him, you have proven yourself worthy of this."
93,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_092","You now possess four pieces of the armor that Estinien, myself, and our forebears did wear. While you doubtless wonder about the fifth, I can tell you only that it is not mine to give. Fear not, however─your triumphs in the trials and against a dragon of the Horde give evidence that drachen blood now resonates with yours. Yes, you stand before me as prepared for your ultimate challenge as any could be."
94,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_093","And yet, before we proceed, I would hear it from your own lips. The great wyrm's power is the stuff of legends. Have you truly resolved to fight this battle? To risk your own life to deliver a foreign land from the clutches of its ancient foe? When you are certain that your mind is settled, return and speak to me."
