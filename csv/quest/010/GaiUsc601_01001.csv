To this end, he lends you his electromagnetic reader, which he bids you use at the hill-sized cluster of corrupted crystals to the west of Revenant's Toll."

53,"TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_005","To ensure that we have enough amplification, we must identify the most potent crystals among the cluster. For this, I need you to go there and use this device to take readings. I'll mark the likely places on your map."
