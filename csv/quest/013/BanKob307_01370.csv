In the latest effort to that end, he has employed diggers fashioned for him under duress by the accomplished metalworkers of the 86th Order. At the dustman's request, consult with Ba Go and find a way to thwart Zo Ga's efforts and narrow the gap between the haves and have–nots."

4,"TEXT_BANKOB307_01370_SEQ_04","You have generated an explosion that would have made Ba Go proud. Make your way back to the 789th Order Dig and report the deed to Bo Bu."
5,"TEXT_BANKOB307_01370_SEQ_05","Bo Bu is overjoyed to hear of your success, relishing the knowledge that the 789th will be competing on even terms with Zo Ga's favored ones, at least for the day. Though the young dustman at times suffers from overzealousness, you would not be averse to seeing his ambition rub off on his peers..."
