1,"TEXT_GAIUSD301_01313_SEQ_01","After sharing their findings with the Sons of Saint Coinach, Urianger and Alisaie have come to a conclusion: that the elder primal Bahamut can be banished into the aether if the colossal devices which hold him captive are deactivated. According to their information, the path to the second mechanism can be found in the North Shroud, where a gigantic fragment of Dalamud impales the ground. Make your way to Fallgourd Float and speak with Alisaie's assistant, Lieutenant Anaelle, to learn what dangers lie ahead."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD301_01313_SEQ_02","Lieutenant Anaelle briefs you on the preliminary investigation made into the fragment, then requests that you speak with a colleague stationed nearer to the massive structure. Find the sharp-eyed private in Alder Springs, and listen to his more detailed report."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSD301_01313_SEQ_03","According to the private, the lack of an imperial presence meant that he and his colleagues were obliged to carve an approach to the fragment themselves. Though the ground itself is now passable, the scout warns you that much peril yet lies in wait. Hurry back to Lieutenant Anaelle, and rendezvous with Alisaie as planned."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSD301_01313_SEQ_04","You return to the serpent lieutenant's post, but it is Alphinaud, and not Alisaie, who meets you there. Your fellow Scion asks that you watch over his sister, and help her find her true purpose. Wasting little time, he then takes his leave, keen that Alisaie should not learn of his visit. Prepare and provision yourself well, and begin your exploration of the Second Coil of Bahamut.
