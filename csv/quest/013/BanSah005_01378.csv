1,"TEXT_BANSAH005_01378_SEQ_01","Novv informs you that Zugg and his Coral Trident fanatics have abducted a high-ranking Lominsan official from the deck of a navy vessel. Visibly distressed by the implications, the clutchfather asks that you speak with a Maelstrom officer to learn if there is any chance to avert the seemingly inevitable plunge into full-scale war. Make your way to Camp Skull Valley and attempt a parley with Commander Falkbryda."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH005_01378_SEQ_02","You attempt to dissuade Falkbryda from her course, but it appears the actions of the Coral Tridents have finally pushed the Maelstrom too far.

Return to Novv's Nursery and report the distressing news to Novv."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH005_01378_SEQ_03","In a desperate effort to defuse the volatile situation, the clutchfather suggests that you and he attempt to rescue the abducted councillor yourselves.

Infiltrate the Serpent's Tongue in western La Noscea, and search the pirates' abode for any written records that appear to document the ambitious plan."
4,"TEXT_BANSAH005_01378_SEQ_04","You have found an ale-stained parchment that illustrates what you believe to be the raid on the councillor's ship. Return to Novv's Nursery and have Novv peruse the crumpled document."
