1,"TEXT_BANSAH108_01386_SEQ_01","Fyuu has news that the Coral Tridents and their Serpent Reaver lackeys have taken control of a trading vessel. Worried that their prideful boasting will encourage others to attempt to emulate their victory, the young Sahagin asks that you slip aboard the merchantman and take the wind out of their sails. Ride an elbst to the trading vessel, and defeat the enemies on deck until the leader is provoked into engaging you himself."

3,"TEXT_BANSAH108_01386_SEQ_03","You inform Fyuu of your success aboard the trading vessel. After hearing of your exploits, Novv's spawnling is reminded of an experience involving a gluttonous feast and a dreadful stomachache... Reassuring you that he is not, in fact, comparing you to a poisonous bottom-feeder, Fyuu thanks you for your continued efforts towards the clutch's cause."
