1,"TEXT_BANSAH001_01374_SEQ_01","Commander Rhiki relays to you the disturbing details of a civilian ship sunk in the Strait of Merlthor. Suspecting Sahagin involvement, she asks that you report to the Maelstrom soldier in charge of the rescue operation. Make your way to Bloodshore in eastern La Noscea, and speak with Private Wilfalk."

The boy also appears to have found a necklace belonging to one of his saviors, and asks that you return it to its beastman owner. Find Novv's Nursery in western La Noscea, and show the trinket to the settlement's wary young guard."
6,"TEXT_BANSAH001_01374_SEQ_06","The young Sahagin acknowledges your honorable intentions, and invites you to enter the nursery. Find and speak with the settlement's chief, Clutchfather Novv."
7,"TEXT_BANSAH001_01374_SEQ_07","Delighted by the return of his cherished necklace, Clutchfather Novv welcomes you to his home. It appears that you have stumbled upon a rare clutch of Sahagin─a group that isn't immediately interested in spilling your lifeblood on the ground. Speak with Novv to learn what you may about this unusually hospitable beastman settlement."
