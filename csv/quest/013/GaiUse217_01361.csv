1,"TEXT_GAIUSE217_01361_SEQ_01","With little more than a look, you signal your readiness to do battle with Leviathan. At your command, the twin vessel <Emphasis>Whorleater</Emphasis> will be towed out onto the open sea, where the Lord of the Whorl awaits you. The fate of Limsa Lominsa rests upon your shoulders. Do not falter.

※The <Emphasis>Whorleater</Emphasis> (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE217_01361_SEQ_02","Following a titanic struggle on the high seas, you succeed in vanquishing Leviathan. Make your way to Limsa Lominsa, that you might bask in the Admiral's gratitude. As always, speak with Zanthael in Bulwark Hall to be admitted to the command room."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE217_01361_SEQ_03","You report your victory over Leviathan to a grateful Merlwyb, who pronounces you her nation's greatest ally. Apparently inspired by your philanthropic endeavors, she subsequently pledges to send provisions to the Doman refugees at Revenant's Toll. Keen to repay this act of kindness, Yugiri, in turn, offers to share knowledge of her Far Eastern martial art with any who would learn. In response to her concern that the style may seem outlandish to Eorzeans, Thancred reveals that there are individuals in Limsa Lominsa who are more than capable of adapting to the techniques. Though the details yet remain hazy, you sense that interesting times lie ahead for you and your fellow adventurers."
