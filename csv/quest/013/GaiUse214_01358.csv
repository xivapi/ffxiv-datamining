1,"TEXT_GAIUSE214_01358_SEQ_01","Falkbryda's scouts are late to return, and she is beginning to fear for them. She bids you ascertain their fate, and furnishes you with a flask of restorative on the chance that her men are injured. Start your search by focusing on the entrance to the Sapsa Spawning Grounds, and treat any wounded you find."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE214_01358_SEQ_02","You have located one of the scouts and given him the restorative. According to the soldier, he alone managed to flee from an ambush, while his comrades were captured and taken to the Serpent's Tongue.

Though the price was dear, the Maelstrom now has the intelligence it sought, and the operation may commence. See to your preparations, and be ready to move out at a moment's notice."
