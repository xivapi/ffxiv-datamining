※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_01","Serendipity delightfully informs you that your tour of Eorzea has been a success─the doll she entrusted to you on behalf of Eshtaime's Lapidaries has surged to the top of the princess contest polls. In order to ensure victory, she suggests you put on a show in Ul'dah. With the princess doll in tow, set out to the streets and perform a /dance for crowds of potential voters.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.

※The Princess Edvya doll minion will be lost upon dismissing it or logging out of the game. The doll can be retrieved by speaking with Serendipity."
2,"TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_02","Your sure-footed display of festival spirit has Ul'dah's most influential aesthetes abuzz with talk of your princess doll. Head back to the Goldsmiths' Guild and relay the good tiding to Serendipity."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_03","No sooner did Serendipity make mention of your now-commanding lead in the polls, nearly guaranteeing victory, than did your princess doll have a curious fit, ceasing to function before your eyes. Upon closer examination, Serendipity discovers that its core has burned out, and suspects that the princess doll had grown quite fond of you─so much so, that the thought of being sold at auction overwhelmed its systems. The doll may yet be saved, but due to its unique architecture, Serendipity requires peach tree oil before any repairs can be attempted. Gather petals from the peach trees in Ul'dah, that Serendipity may extract the oil needed to save the doll."
4,"TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_04","You have scoured the flora of Ul'dah for the freshest, most fragrant peach blossoms to be had, and gathered three sackfuls for Serendipity. Deliver them to the Goldsmiths' Guild, that Serendipity may begin making repairs to the doll."
5,"TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_05","Just when it seemed that all repair efforts were for naught, the doll's eyes lit up again upon hearing Serendipity offer it to you. It would seem the doll feigned a malfunction in order to realize its one true desire: to remain in the company of the adventurer of whom it had grown so fond. The guildmaster then muses that this behavior is not unlike Princess Edvya's own ruse so many years ago. Though the contest has long since been lost, Serendipity is comforted by the knowledge that you, she, and the doll have celebrated the true spirit of Little Ladies' Day in a way that few do these days. She implores you to take the doll as your own, and grant its holiday wish."
