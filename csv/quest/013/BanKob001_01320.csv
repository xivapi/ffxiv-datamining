1,"TEXT_BANKOB001_01320_SEQ_01","Lieutenant Trachraet reveals to you a troubling development: a Maelstrom convoy was recently intercepted, the unidentified perpetrators absconding with a vital shipment of saltpeter. He beseeches your aid, asking you to travel to Swiftperch in western La Noscea to assist Lieutenant Skaetswys, the officer tasked with leading the investigation."
