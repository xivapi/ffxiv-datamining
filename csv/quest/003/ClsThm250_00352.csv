58,"TEXT_CLSTHM250_00352_AKUMAA_000_21","Here is the first chapter─mine own humble contribution to our research. It tells the tale of how we became aware of the creature's existence, and delves into the nature of the urn that imprisoned her fell power."
59,"TEXT_CLSTHM250_00352_AKUMAA_000_200","I think you shall find the opening pages quite enlightening. Ah, there is no greater reward for a scholar than to have one's work appreciated!"

81,"TEXT_CLSTHM250_00352_COCOBYGO_000_78","<gasp> You cannot! That succubus will drain you to a lifeless husk! And such a feast will awaken all her terrible magicks!"
