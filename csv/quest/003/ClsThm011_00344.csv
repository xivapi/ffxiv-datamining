49,"TEXT_CLSTHM011_00344_YAYAKE_000_2","A wise decision, indeed. To prepare for your initiation, I would have you study the volumes of fundamental thaumaturgical principle. All one hundred and eight of them."
50,"TEXT_CLSTHM011_00344_YAYAKE_000_3","...Or at least, I <Emphasis>would</Emphasis> if such requirements had not been abolished. “Too great a deterrent to fresh novices,” they said. I suppose you shall just have to settle for calling upon the collective wisdom of our guildmasters."

52,"TEXT_CLSTHM011_00344_YAYAKE_000_10","You choose to close your eyes to fate's beckoning hand? Very well, but you cannot avoid this path forever. Sooner or later, your steps will bring you back to the Ossuary...and our guild."

69,"TEXT_CLSTHM011_00344_COCOBUKI_000_41","My first gift to you shall be an addition to your hunting log─the names of such enemies that will prove suitable to your training as a thaumaturge."
70,"TEXT_CLSTHM011_00344_COCOBUKI_000_42","The second and third gifts are this scepter and shield─instruments you shall need to focus the destructive force of your will."
71,"TEXT_CLSTHM011_00344_COCOBUKI_000_43","Did you believe your initiation over? My dear disciple, we have only just begun. Take your new weapons in hand, and I will set you forth upon your first trial..."
