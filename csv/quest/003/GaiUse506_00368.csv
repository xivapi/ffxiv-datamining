1,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_SEQ_01","Lieutenant Edelstein informs you that imperial soldiers have been seen marching from Castrum Meridianum. The garrison leader would have you join the Crystal Braves in their efforts to repel the advancing Garleans. Speak with Lieutenant Alianne of the 4th Unit Braves, and lend your strength to her planned counteroffensive."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_SEQ_02","Upon speaking with Alianne, you learn that another force of imperial soldiers has been spotted attempting to conceal themselves along the west approach to the processing plant. Before the lieutenant can outline her strategy, however, Captain Ilberd arrives, and drafts you into assisting the 3rd Unit Braves as they set out to engage this second threat. Speak with Yuyuhase at Raubahn's Push for further instructions."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_SEQ_03","Yuyuhase welcomes your arrival, and explains his plan to uproot the Garlean raiders from their places of concealment. Search your assigned areas, and eliminate any imperial soldiers you encounter."

5,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_SEQ_05","You have defeated the remaining imperial troops. Return to Yuyuhase at Raubahn's Push and report your success."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_SEQ_06","You rejoin Yuyuhase, and he speaks of similar victories in the field. The Lalafellin Brave offers to share news of the Garleans' demise with Alianne, and asks that you do the same for Lieutenant Edelstein. Return to the Ceruleum Processing Plant and make your report to the garrison leader."
7,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_SEQ_07","You make your report to a relieved Lieutenant Edelstein, who once more thanks you for your deeds. With the Garlean threat neutralized, it would appear the processing plant has been delivered from potential disaster."

65,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_ILBERD_000_025","Greetings, Scion. I understand the commander bid you and your fellows come lend a hand to the Braves. With such mighty heroes at its disposal, the 4th should have little trouble contending with aught the Garleans might throw at them."
66,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_ILBERD_000_026","But even you cannot be everywhere at once. The 3rd was getting restless holed up in Ul'dah, so I marched them out here to fill any holes in the plant's defenses and add their numbers to your counterattack."
67,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_ALIANNE_000_027","The reinforcements are welcome. We've enough soldiers now to divide our own forces and safely engage the enemy far beyond the walls."

72,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_ILBERD_000_031","When you're ready to proceed, report to Lieutenant Yuyuhase─his scouts should have a rough idea of where the imperials have concealed themselves by now."

75,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_YUYUHASE_000_051","Now, this detached force we've been sent to eliminate has split into smaller squads─the better to conceal themselves within the terrain hereabouts, I imagine.

79,"TEXT_GAIUSE506_00368_YUYUHASE_000_061","These imperials, though, they certainly made us earn our pay. I would be a happy man if I never had to tussle with another of those magitek horrors..."
