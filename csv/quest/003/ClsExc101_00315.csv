1,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_SEQ_01","Wyrnzoen has taken a personal interest in preparing you to take vengeance against Kujata, the beast responsible for slaying Sighard's parents. Focus your rage, and slay the galagos found near Blind Iron Mines."
2,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_SEQ_02","You have slain the specified creatures. Return to the Marauders' Guild and report to Axemaster Wyrnzoen."
3,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_SEQ_03","After returning to Axemaster Wyrnzoen, you learn that Kujata has been on a destructive rampage through the lands near Tiller's Rest. Find the overturned wain in middle La Noscea, and slay the plainstriders that seek to devour the exposed cargo of foodstuffs."
4,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_SEQ_04","You have defeated the plainstriders. Return to the Marauders' Guild and report to Axemaster Wyrnzoen."
5,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_SEQ_05","Though you have successfully defended the cargo of produce from the voracious plainstriders, you learn that such incidents will continue so long as Kujata is allowed to rampage unchecked. To fully prepare yourself to defeat the so-called Stampeding Mountain, you must heed Wyrnzoen's advice and commit yourself to your training.

※The next marauder quest will be available from Wyrnzoen upon reaching level 15."

55,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_WYRNZOEN_000_12","The foodstuffs spilled from the overturned wain have attracted all manner of hungry predators. Without produce for the market, the farmers will surely suffer for coin this season. Your duty is thus clear: put down these rapacious scavengers and preserve the cargo."
56,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_WYRNZOEN_000_20","Once again, your capacity for carnage has been tested and proven. The creatures you defeated, however, were merely some of the many base scavengers that subsist on the scraps left in the wake of Kujata's rampages."
