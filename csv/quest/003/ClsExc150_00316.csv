50,"TEXT_CLSEXC150_00316_WYRNZOEN_000_3","This monster is no Kujata, but the threat it presents to the locals is nonetheless sufficient to warrant our attention. It should also prove a worthy foe to test your burgeoning prowess."

54,"TEXT_CLSEXC150_00316_REYNFRED_000_12","So, I s'pose yer here to hunt down our “local trouble”? What ye need do, then, is take yerself northwest up towards Camp Skull Valley, and give a good whistle."
55,"TEXT_CLSEXC150_00316_REYNFRED_000_13","The mean bugger yer after─his name's “Patripatan,” by the by─will come runnin' across the weeded plains. He'll think yer trespassin' on his territory, see, so ye better have that cleaver o' yers ready. Oschon's blessin's be upon ye."

65,"TEXT_CLSEXC150_00316_WYRNZOEN_000_61","This feat of strength deserves recognition, and you shall have it in the form of a new technique. Adopted and perfected by our guild forebears, the Tomahawk throw was first devised by pirates as an opening attack on closing enemy vessels."
