2,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_SEQ_02","You have been briefed on the details of the operation. The Flames anticipate that the Amalj'aa will offer fierce resistance, and you are urged to prepare accordingly. When you are ready, proceed to the Invisible City, and lie in wait at the designated location."

Though this revelation casts a grim shadow over your victory, you find yourself more determined than ever to play your part as a Scion."

170,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_177","Thancred has told me everything. You have done well to return to us."
171,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_178","The perils you faced were undeniably great, yet a part of me believes that I had no cause to fear. And now we can put paid to our long investigation."
172,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_179","As we suspected, the Amalj'aa undertook both the robbery and the abductions with the aim of summoning their primal, Ifrit."
173,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_180","Nor is this tale limited to Ul'dah. Similar incidents have been rife in both Limsa Lominsa and Gridania of late."
174,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_181","I daresay you've been curious as to how these crimes are linked to the primals. Permit me to explain."
175,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_182","Having manifested in the physical realm, primals must consume aether if they are to maintain their presence here. And the stronger they become, the more aether they require."
176,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_183","Now, aether exists throughout creation. It flows through all life, and permeates the very air that we breathe."
177,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_184","Alas, this alone will not suffice to sustain the likes of Ifrit. Nay, he and his kind require a more concentrated source of aether─crystals."
178,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_185","It is for this reason that incidents involving crystals can often be traced back to a primal."
179,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_186","Which leaves us with the why of the abductions. To understand this, you must first understand how primals are born."
180,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_187","When all is well with the world, primals possess no physical form. Their essence is dispersed across the great river of aether."
181,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_188","However, when the world is plunged into chaos, those who worship the primals cry out to their gods for deliverance from suffering."
182,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_189","These cries serve as a beacon toward which a primal's essence is irresistibly drawn. It is this coming together─or “aetheric coalescence”─which grants the beings physical form."
183,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_190","Once born, a primal gains strength from its followers' worship. The more numerous and fervent they are, the more powerful their god becomes."
184,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_191","But the primals are seldom satisfied with such reverence as their adherents freely give, and in order to gain more power, they do not scruple to <Emphasis>create</Emphasis> followers. They do this by “tempering” mortals─a process to which you yourself were subjected."
185,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_192","Yet even as Ifrit took your comrades in his thrall, you alone remained unaffected. This is thanks to the power you possess─the Echo."
186,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_193","We know not the why of it, but those blessed with the Echo are immune to primal influence."
187,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_194","It is as though a greater power protects us..."
188,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_195","When first you came to us, I told you that the Echo would be instrumental in dealing with the primal threat. I trust you now begin to see why."
189,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_196","The recent incidents all share a common trait: meticulous planning. Such elaborate designs are a new development, and one which fills me with an unshakable sense of foreboding."

191,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_198","Ah, the Immortal Flames assured me that they will deal with the aftermath, so you need not concern yourself with that. We may rest easy for a time."

193,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_200","You may be sure it won't last long. Once the people learn the identity of the hero who felled Ifrit, I fear you will have nary a moment to yourself!"
194,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_201","Whether she intended to or no, Minfilia neglected to tell you something─something I think it would be best you heard from one of us."
195,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_202","It concerns the tempered abductees that were rescued... I am sorry to report that all are to be put to death, the Flames with whom you were imprisoned included. Needless to say, this information must not be made known to the public."
196,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_203","I swear to you that we would not do this if there were any other recourse─but once a man is tempered, he is tempered for life. His very existence lends strength to the primal whom he cannot choose but worship."
197,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_204","And so we Scions continue our fight, that no more innocents need be sacrificed. I hope that you will continue to stand with us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
