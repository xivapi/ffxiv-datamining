2,"TEXT_SUBCTS813_01434_SEQ_02","You find and rescue the missing retainer from a grisly death at the hands of wild beasts, thus earning her gratitude. Rather than reward you herself, the retainer bids you return to Ul'dah and speak with her supervisor, Chachabi, in the Sapphire Avenue Exchange."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS813_01434_SEQ_03","Recognizing that you are unfamiliar with the latest services provided by retainers, Chachabi explains that ventures are procurement expeditions which you may ask your retainers to undertake. She then gifts you several ventures, a unique scrip used to pay for these services. Duly informed, you may now speak with your retainers and assign them these tasks at your leisure."
