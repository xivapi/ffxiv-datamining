2,"TEXT_GAIUSD018_01413_SEQ_02","R'ashaht Rhiki confirms that the Lord of the Whorl has indeed returned to terrorize the seas. Reports of the primal's most recent attack suggest that this incarnation of Leviathan is possessed of truly nightmarish power and represents a threat that must be neutralized with all possible haste. As soon as your preparations are complete, make your way to the Moraby Drydocks and speak with Sergeant Styrnlona."
