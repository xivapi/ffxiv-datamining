2,"TEXT_SUBPST003_01484_SEQ_02","To Momodi's chagrin, the missive is revealed to be a love letter from a not-so-secret─and less-than-admirable─admirer, a pretentious lad by the name of Thomas. Unwilling to take no for an answer, the would-be suitor enlists your aid in seeking out the man who crafted Momodi's prized hairpin, in hopes of proving himself superior to any of his beloved's old flames. Rendezvous with Thomas at the Goldsmiths' Guild to begin the search."
3,"TEXT_SUBPST003_01484_SEQ_03","Memedesu of the Goldsmiths' Guild enlightens you as to the origins of Momodi's hairpin. It was crafted by Momoroto, a once-promising young artisan who abandoned his craft and left Ul'dah behind for reasons unknown. Make for Crescent Cove in western Thanalan and seek out the man, who now passes his days as a fisherman."

Offended by the mere thought that Momodi would prefer this listless Lalafell to himself, Thomas dashes off to the Quicksand, where he intends to win the heart of his beloved once and for all. Return to Momodi and see how she fares."
5,"TEXT_SUBPST003_01484_SEQ_05","An exasperated Momodi reiterates to her stubborn suitor that she has no romantic feelings for Momoroto, though she does regret burdening him with expectations that might have weighed in his decision to abandon his youthful dreams. She further explains that she took on her current position in the Adventurers' Guild out of a desire to be a guiding hand to all those who would dream of serving the realm, and that she wears Momoroto's hairpin as a reminder of what can happen if well-meant words of encouragement are carried too far. Moved by Momodi's rousing speech, Thomas vows to find a dream of his own, one that might at last win him the admiration and affection of his beloved."
