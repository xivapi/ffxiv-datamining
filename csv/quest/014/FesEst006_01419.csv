※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST006_01419_SEQ_01","Jihli Aliapoh has been granted a vision of what she claims to be the last set of stolen Archon eggs in southern Thanalan. With Dreamers dispatched to retrieve them, she wishes to ensure their security, and would have you speak with Orselfaux in Ul'dah to confirm they have arrived without incident. Travel to Ul'dah and speak with Orselfaux to discern the status of the Archon eggs.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST006_01419_SEQ_02","You learn from Orselfaux that Augustiniel has once again volunteered to help in the delivery of the eggs in spite of his recent exertions. With a group of spriggans now roaming the halls of Ul'dah, Orselfaux is concerned that Augustiniel is not fit to watch the eggs, and would ask that you seek him out to ensure they are secure. Orselfaux suspects the eggs may need to be moved to a safer location, and suggests you seek the aid of another adventurer to assist you in Augustiniel's stead. Team up with a like–minded adventurer and search for Augustiniel and the eggs on the Steps of Thal."
3,"TEXT_FESEST006_01419_SEQ_03","You find Augustiniel in the Steps of Thal, too weak to go on and in desperate need of assistance. Having collapsed after reaching the Gate of Thal, his partner ran off in search of assistance, leaving him to care for both eggs on his own. No longer fit to continue with the delivery, he implores you and your friend to carry them to the Gold Court where they may be protected until the spriggans are driven out of Ul'dah. One of you must carry the pristine Archon egg, and the other the midnight Archon egg. Wearing your respective caps, carry the eggs together with your companion to the Gold Court."
4,"TEXT_FESEST006_01419_SEQ_04","See that your Archon egg is carried safely to the Gold Court, avoiding any spriggans that may cross your path."

6,"TEXT_FESEST006_01419_SEQ_06","Orselfaux is glad to hear the Archon eggs have been safely delivered to the Gold Court, and thanks you for your efforts. With time still remaining until Hatching Hour, he returns to the affairs of the celebration, and bids you speak with Jihli Aliapoh to assure her that the eggs are safe."
7,"TEXT_FESEST006_01419_SEQ_07","With all of the Archon eggs back in the possession of her Dreamers, Jihli Aliapoh is at a loss for words in expressing her gratitude for your efforts. Though you must now part ways until the long–awaited egg ceremony, she assures you it will be an unforgettable experience."

51,"TEXT_FESEST006_01419_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_003","I received word not long ago that they have been retrieved, though not without interference by the spriggans.
