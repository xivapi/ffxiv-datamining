※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_SEQ_01","Jihli Aliapoh teaches you the origins of Hatching–tide, a fledgling festival born from a vision she claims was bestowed upon her by the Twelve Archons of the Sixth Umbral Era. Eager to have you partake in the celebration, Jihli bids you speak with one of her Dreamers to acquire a pristine egg cap. Retrieve a cap from one of the Dreamers, then speak with her again when you've made yourself presentable.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_SEQ_02","There is still time before Hatching Hour, the final ceremony heralding the Twelve Archons' return to Eorzea. To that end, Jihli Aliapoh encourages you to try your hand at egg hunting, a popular Hatching–tide festival activity. She informs you of the different kinds of eggs which can be opened to reveal a gift, or exchanged for eggs of higher quality with richer rewards.

As you prepare to set out on an egg–hunting adventure, however, she asks that you pay her a visit when you've had your fill of festival games. Though preparations appear to be going as planned, perhaps this year's Hatching–tide is beset with more troubles than she would have you believe."

51,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_001","Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jihli Aliapoh, and these eggs are for the celebration of Hatching–tide, which is nigh upon us."
52,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_002","The tradition began several years ago, after I was blessed with a vision by the Twelve Archons of ages past. These heroes are said to have lived through the Sixth Umbral Calamity, fighting bravely against an encroaching darkness that would have otherwise seen to the realm's destruction."
53,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_003","Descending from the heavens atop brilliantly colored eggs, they delivered a message unto me which, to this day, burns brightly in my mind:
“Rise, young Dreamer, and make ready the vessel for our return.”"

A laborious task for one person, to be sure, but I would not be alone in this endeavor for long."
55,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_005","In time, other believers would join my cause, and come to be known as Dreamers. Years have passed since our vigil began, and still they remain by my side, awaiting the return of those fabled Archons of yore."
56,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_006","And so every year during Hatching–tide, we gather here with eggs to serve as their vessels. They have yet to appear before us, but I believe this year will be different. For it was by their grace the realm survived the Sixth Umbral Calamity, and I am sure they had a hand in our survival of the Seventh."
57,"TEXT_FESEST001_01414_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_007","That's right, my friend, the time has come for the Twelve Archons to return, and their vessels will soon be ready!"
