86,"TEXT_GAIUSE310_01451_YSHTOLA_000_140","Hmph. Well, at least the sylph offered some manner of apology for his mischief. But more importantly, his insistence that we proceed no further seems rather revealing, does it not?"
87,"TEXT_GAIUSE310_01451_MAXIO_000_145","Is walking one unharmed? This one would not like to see walking one in pain."
88,"TEXT_GAIUSE310_01451_PAPALYMO_000_150","We overheard your exchange with our tormentor. His clumsy attempt at deceit would almost be endearing if time were not of the essence."
89,"TEXT_GAIUSE310_01451_PAPALYMO_000_151","Happily, I managed to take a reading of the surrounding area while you had his attention. As I suspected, the site of the Lord of Levin's summoning is very close indeed!"
