Sezul has another request that requires a featherless one's touch."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_SEQ_01","With the construction of a new lathe in mind, Sezul has tasked you with obtaining a high-grade gearwheel. Speak with your fellow featherless one, Tataramu, and see if he has any ideas on where to begin your search.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_SEQ_02","While discussing the subject of lathes, Tataramu recalls that just such a tool was used in his grandfather's workshop years ago. The eager designer reasons that Colson, a veteran Skyways employee, would know better than any what became of his grandsire's tools. Head to the Carline Canopy in Gridania, and track down Tataramu's aged acquaintance."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_SEQ_03","After explaining your predicament to Colson, the old man casts his mind back to the days when he first worked with Tataramu's grandfather. Though the company founder's original workshop has long since been dismantled, Colson suggests that you approach one of the old hands at the Bobbing Cork and ask if anything remains of Tatanora's tools. Travel to Fallgourd Float, and speak with Aeluuin."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_SEQ_04","You question Aeluuin about the lathe, but the inn worker appears unaware that such a workshop ever existed in Fallgourd. He does, however, mention a pile of old, unclaimed goods that have been gathering dust in the inn's storeroom. Search through the stack of antiques by the side of the Bobbing Cork, and check for any abandoned lathe parts."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_SEQ_05","Tataramu appears just as you locate the lathe gearwheel, having finally remembered where his grandfather's workshop used to be. Checking over the precious part, the young man notices a dedication written by his grandfather inscribed on its surface. Return to Ehcatl and hand the gearwheel to Sezul."
6,"TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_SEQ_06","You deliver the gearwheel to Sezul, and the Ehcatl Nine chief confirms that the “Dezul Qualan” in the dedication is the same Ixal for whom he named the hybrid airship. It would appear that Sezul's mentor and Tataramu's grandsire had forged a friendship based on their mutual passion for aeronautics. Both Chief Totoloc and Tataramu cannot help but feel the guiding hand of fate in their growing partnership..."

80,"TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_COLSON_000_049","...But I'm afraid the place was shut down and dismantled for lumber after Tatabaru assumed management of the company. It was the end of an era, after all."
