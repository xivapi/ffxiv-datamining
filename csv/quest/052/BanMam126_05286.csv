48,"TEXT_BANMAM126_05286_KAGEELJA_000_001","Mamook's traditional dishes tend to be sparse when it comes to seasonings. Aside from the salt taken from Bitterbark Cenote, the sweet flavoring provided by najool, and a fermented fish sauce, there isn't much else we add to our food."
49,"TEXT_BANMAM126_05286_KAGEELJA_000_002","So for those who have gone on to experience Tuliyollal's varied cuisine, our local fare is decidedly lacking in comparison."

65,"TEXT_BANMAM126_05286_KAGEELJA_000_018","As it so happens, this flavor also complements tiika selvaas. Serving it with a side of tasty soup has only made our new dish all the more popular."
