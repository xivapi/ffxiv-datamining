50,"TEXT_BANMAM110_05270_KAGEELJA_000_003","And so she did─in fact, she made more than enough for everyone in Gok Golma!"

66,"TEXT_BANMAM110_05270_KAGEELJA_000_021","Wonderful, I am glad that they were well received. Anggir analyzed medicinal herbs from both the lower and upper forests to create an effective remedial agent for us Mamool Ja, you see."
67,"TEXT_BANMAM110_05270_KAGEELJA_000_022","I mention this in case you are tempted to try one of the compresses for yourself─the stimulation may be too much. Perhaps she can further adapt the formula, and one day make compresses that can be used by all. No doubt they would be popular in a place like Tuliyollal."
68,"TEXT_BANMAM110_05270_KAGEELJA_000_023","Until then, I believe she intends to make additional prototypes until she's satisfied with their quality. Please lend me a hand when the time comes to distribute them again."
