0,"TEXT_FESANX101_05297_SEQ_00","The wandering minstrel is in search of inspiration.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANX101_05297_SEQ_01","Making your way through Limsa Lominsa during the Rising, you come upon the wandering minstrel at the Aftcastle. The man seeks inspiration for a new song, and requests your aid in speaking with the locals for their tales. To that end do you head together to the Drowning Wench, where you chance to witness Baderon in conversation with a fiery Miqo'te child named R'tcha. The young one wishes to become an adventurer so that she might leave the city alone, but Baderon turns her down out of concern for her safety. Worried that she might still attempt to sneak out, however, the tavernkeep bids you keep an eye on her, and suggests that you begin by speaking with Klindrael, the Yellowjacket stationed at the Tempest Gate.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANX101_05297_SEQ_02","You learn from Klindrael that a child fitting R'tcha's description did indeed leave the city via the gate. Finding it suspicious, however, the sentry alerted her comrade Ayoyo, who has likely stopped R'tcha outside, and you waste no time setting out to find them."
3,"TEXT_FESANX101_05297_SEQ_03","No sooner do you emerge in lower La Noscea than you locate R'tcha and Ayoyo. Acknowledging the little one's determination, the minstrel makes a proposal: rather than becoming an adventurer, R'tcha could employ the services of one instead. So it is that you are tasked with escorting R'tcha to Oschon's Torch, that she might verify the rumor of child-abducting ghosts, with the affable Ayoyo also volunteering to come along."
4,"TEXT_FESANX101_05297_SEQ_04","Having asked you your name, R'tcha offers you her thanks for your assistance. In helping her to fulfill her goal, so too may you help the minstrel to find inspiration, and you resolve to see your young client safely to the lighthouse."
