48,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_001","Say, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. If you plan to be out and about, I don't suppose you could procure us some najool stems from Golmajiik Grove?"
49,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_002","In case you're wondering about the sudden demand, Anggir requires a few specimens for testing. Seems she has plans to repurpose them."
50,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_003","I'm told the last batch you brought us yielded promising results, but Anggir requires more data...and more specimens for testing, of course."
51,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_004","In any event, we'll have plenty of time to discuss her experiments further when you return. Once you arrive at the grove, tell Kiishel Ja I sent you. She'll supply you with the stems we need."
52,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KIISHELJA_000_005","Here on behalf of Kageel Ja, yes? The stems are ready and waiting─feel free to take as many as you need."
53,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KIISHELJA_000_006","It does my heart good to know they won't be going to waste. Send the folks at the gainery my best regards!"
54,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_007","Welcome back. How fared your trip to the grove?"
55,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_008","Much obliged, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. These are excellent samples...and sufficiently fibrous, as well."
56,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_009","Najool stems are found where the fruit meets the leaves, you see. To the undisciplined eye, one might mistake them for a part of the tree trunk. While they are perfectly edible, we tend to dispose of them after the harvest."
57,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_010","Anggir, however, believes their naturally occurring fibers could be utilized to craft string and cloth. And with these samples at her disposal, she'll be able to put those theories to the proof."
58,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_011","As you might expect, Anggir's success has only strengthened her resolve to craft textiles from these stem fibers, so she's eager to continue her research."
59,"TEXT_BANMAM105_05265_KAGEELJA_000_012","If we require any more of them in the future, I'll be sure to keep you informed."
