49,"TEXT_BANMAM102_05262_KAGEELJA_000_001","Good to see you, my friend. You'll be happy to know the leavings you gathered for us proved more effective than we dared hope. In fact, we're of a mind to try more with different crops. Might I bother you to collect a few more sacks?"
50,"TEXT_BANMAM102_05262_KAGEELJA_000_002","You'll not have to look far in the Ja Tiika Heartland. The hunters there looking for mushrooms are, more often than not, accompanied by wivres. Should you see them, you're certain to find all that we need."

61,"TEXT_BANMAM102_05262_KAGEELJA_000_016","Compost made from fallen leaves and such was fine when we only had najool to worry about, but a more diverse selection of crops calls for richer soil. And that's where animal manure comes in."
