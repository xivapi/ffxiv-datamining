1,"TEXT_CHRHDB922_05296_SEQ_01","Inspector's Log:
To what far-flung shores have I found myself flung this time? Well, irregardless of inexplicable intergalactic travel (or rather more local jaunts), I, Hildibrand, agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire, have made my triumphant return! After emerging from a slumber of thirty some-odd years, I have made the acquaintance of a man purported to be my twin from another world─an assertion I am inclined to push back against, given the man's somewhat surly disposition. However, like yours truly, he appears possessed of a sincere desire to solve mysteries and redress the wrongs of the world, so for now, let us see if a partnership may yet be forged!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Detective Hardiboiled shares the details of the new mystery he stumbled across: an ominous tale of ghoulish experiments and suspiciously empty specimen cages. A researcher who survived the zombification of his peers has continued their work in secret, imbuing monsters with the souls of criminals marked for “rehabilitation.” Hoping to recover more data from the battered storage device he discovered, Hardiboiled invites you to his domicile in the recreation zone of Solution Nine. The Case of the Fiendish Fugitives has begun..."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB922_05296_SEQ_02","Although the device was more damaged than anticipated, Hardiboiled was able to piece together a partial file on one of the criminal subjects. It seems a habitual thief now inhabits the body of an eyeclops and, judging by past tendencies, is likely engaging in acts of larceny primarily to inconvenience and infuriate. The detective reasons that as electrope is Alexandria's most critical resource, then the quarry in Heritage Found would be too tempting a target to ignore. Perhaps someone at Electrope Strike knows something that could help with your investigation."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB922_05296_SEQ_03","A helpful quarry worker confirms that someone has indeed been stealing raw electrope shipments and happily agrees to provide bait to snare the thief. All appears to be proceeding to plan, but upon spotting you lurking with intent to ambush, the wary eyeclops flees before the trap can be sprung."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDB922_05296_SEQ_04","Despite giving immediate chase, you lose the thief in a field dominated by towering eyeclopes. Eyeclopses. Eyeclopsi...? Detective Hardiboiled─firmly in the “eyeclopes” camp─suggests you split up and approach the brutes, noting that the criminal in question has a cowardly reputation. Find the one that does not attempt to squish you on sight, and you will have surely found your man-in-a-monster."
5,"TEXT_CHRHDB922_05296_SEQ_05","You locate the thief masquerading as a wild eyeclops, but are once again left choking in the dust kicked up by his impressive escape velocity. Did Nashu see which way he went? Only one way to find out."
6,"TEXT_CHRHDB922_05296_SEQ_06","Hardiboiled and Hildibrand corner the eyeclops thief. Following a tense standoff during which the detective and the inspector display their very different approaches to apprehending criminals, the eyeclops is convinced to surrender. He also volunteers what little information he knows of the researcher who not only transferred his soul into his monstrous body, but also coerced him into stealing the electrope. Satisfied that you have learned all there is to learn, Hardiboiled bids you wait for him at his place, then leaves to deliver the thief to the authorities."
7,"TEXT_CHRHDB922_05296_SEQ_07","Back in Solution Nine, Hardiboiled muses over the researcher mastermind's possible motivations and the other monsters undoubtedly in his employ. These fugitive flunkies will be trying to avoid detection, possibly even operating outside the dome's confines. Admitting his unfamiliarity with the outside world, the detective asks for your continued assistance with the case─a request which Hildibrand is only too pleased to answer. Hardiboiled also alludes to a former nemesis known as the “Crime King,” who may very well have been part of the researcher's ersatz rehabilitation program. Eager to return to pulling data from the storage device, the hard-bitten gumshoe bids you drop in the next time you are in the neighborhood..."
