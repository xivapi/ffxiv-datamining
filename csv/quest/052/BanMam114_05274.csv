58,"TEXT_BANMAM114_05274_KAGEELJA_000_017","You know, Anggir has actually been studying the flow of energy around the area ever since Gok Golma was established."
59,"TEXT_BANMAM114_05274_KAGEELJA_000_018","We've done quite a bit of work on the gainery since then, but our accomplishments would mean little if we're negatively impacting the forest as a whole. Anggir takes these inspections very seriously."
