49,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_KAGEELJA_000_002","More and more people have been visiting Gok Golma of late, but for those raising little ones or suffering from illness, it can be difficult to make it out here."
50,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_KAGEELJA_000_003","So it was that we started a delivery service...only to realize we rarely have enough people on hand to make the deliveries. It would help us enormously if you could see this order to its destination."
51,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_KAGEELJA_000_004","There you go─a basket full of fresh produce! The note inside will tell you its intended recipient."

53,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_006","Oh, my order! Sorry I couldn't pick it up in person─with a hatchling in the house, it can be hard to step outside even for a moment."
54,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_007","I honestly don't know how I lived without the gainery's vegetables. They give me the energy to keep going, and taste so good that even my fussy child will eat an entire bowlful if I grate them first."
55,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_008","Thank you for the delivery, and please give my best to Kageel Ja."
56,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_009","Thank you again for bringing my order. Some days it's just impossible to leave the house..."
57,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287B_000_010","<cough> <splutter> Sore throat, sore head, dizzy spells, and now to make things worse, an empty stomach... Just end it all and put me out of my misery."

59,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287B_000_012","You are the savior of empty bellies, and by extension, the world itself. Had I wrestled with this hunger much longer, my suffering would have rent the very star asunder!"
60,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287B_000_013","<cough> Don't look at me like that, I'm in pain! <sniff> In any case, you have my thanks...as does Kageel Ja, if you would be so kind as to pass them on."

63,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_016","Ah, you've brought my food, thank you. I injured my foot, you see, and was forced to rely on a kind soul to make the delivery."
64,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_017","It's just... I was watching those young ones out at the gainery night and day, doing their part to build a better Mamook."
65,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_018","And I thought, “I should be doing something, too!” So I went out to help pick some herbs, slipped on a rock, and...well, now look at me. Not as spry as I once was, I'm afraid."
66,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_MOB05287A_000_019","I appreciate you going out of your way for an old fool. Don't worry─I have someone stopping by later to help me cook these lovely vegetables."
67,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_KAGEELJA_000_020","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you're back. No issues with the delivery, then?"
68,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_KAGEELJA_000_021","Yes, our customers are always so pleased to see their vegetables arrive. Thank you for shouldering the task this time."
69,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_KAGEELJA_000_022","In ways both large and small, the new crops have changed not only how people in Mamook think about food, but how they act around each other."
70,"TEXT_BANMAM127_05287_KAGEELJA_000_024","I'd like to think our continued efforts at the gainery will ensure that these changes are for the better. Here, take this for your trouble."
