※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANMAM002_05256_SEQ_01","While the gainery is steadily making progress, Anggir is quick to detect a pest infestation in the burgeoning harvest. She explains the need for a companion plant to ward off the unwanted insects, and after some deliberation Ruvoll Ja suggests introducing branchbearers to the farm. These seedkin resemble birds but are, in truth, plants that possess their own techniques for warding off pests. Petitioning your help in confronting such a specimen, Ruvoll Ja sets off for northwest of Golmajiik Grove.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANMAM002_05256_SEQ_02","You regroup with Ruvoll Ja and discuss strategy. The Doppro knows techniques that can tame a wild branchbearer, and he would like to lure one over with something appealing to the creature. You set out to gather what he needs with the hope that the impending confrontation does not result in violence."
3,"TEXT_BANMAM002_05256_SEQ_03","Ruvoll Ja masterfully befriends a branchbearer with sweet words and sparse magicks. He accompanies his new charge back to Gok Golma, where Anggir is no doubt anxiously awaiting your arrival."
4,"TEXT_BANMAM002_05256_SEQ_04","The branchbearer takes to its new home swimmingly, unleashing a shower of protective aether upon you and your companions. With the aid of these creatures, the pests plaguing Gok Golma's young plants recede, proving the seedkin to be deeply beneficial to the garden. Still, this is but the first of many hurdles the gainery must overcome if it is to bring real change to Mamook, and your continued cooperation will be paramount to its success."
