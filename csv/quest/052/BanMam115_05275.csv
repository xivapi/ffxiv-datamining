52,"TEXT_BANMAM115_05275_KAGEELJA_000_004","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Thanks to your well-placed proclamations, the number of customers visiting our humble stall grows day by day."
53,"TEXT_BANMAM115_05275_KAGEELJA_000_005","Even so, we'd like to keep reminding people that fresh vegetables are available whenever they need them. Would you mind heading out again and spreading word of the gainery's ripened produce?"
54,"TEXT_BANMAM115_05275_MOB05275A_000_007","I'm still wondering what to have for dinner tonight. Najool and fish stew is all well and good, but I get tired of the same flavors..."
55,"TEXT_BANMAM115_05275_MOB05275A_000_008","Hm, what to make for dinner... Those vegetables we had last time were such a refreshing─and delicious─change from the usual fare. Perhaps I'll pick up something from the gainery."

70,"TEXT_BANMAM115_05275_MOB05275C_000_024","Ah yes, I'd heard they were growing crops over there. And harvesting enough to sell the surplus, it seems. This is great news, thank you for letting me know!"
71,"TEXT_BANMAM115_05275_MOB05275C_000_026","They have fresh produce again today? That's good, because I was just about to pay their stall a visit."
