49,"TEXT_BANMAM121_05281_KAGEELJA_000_001","I see some yellowing leaves here and there, some slow growers and the like... So after discussing the matter with Anggir, we've decided to make a vitalization tonic and I would like your help with gathering one of the prime ingredients."
50,"TEXT_BANMAM121_05281_KAGEELJA_000_002","The tonic we made for the struggling plants seems to be doing the trick, so I'd like to mix up some more for future use."
51,"TEXT_BANMAM121_05281_KAGEELJA_000_003","A quality tonic requires quality ingredients, however, and who better to procure them than you?"

55,"TEXT_BANMAM121_05281_KAGEELJA_000_010","Procurement of the mineral dust we need falls to you. It should be found somewhere around Ankledeep."

60,"TEXT_BANMAM121_05281_KAGEELJA_000_017","The tonic we make will help maintain the health of the plants themselves. We improved their surroundings─enriching the soil, adding compost, repelling insects and such─but nurturing the vegetables directly was something we were missing."
61,"TEXT_BANMAM121_05281_KAGEELJA_000_018","As Anggir lent her expertise to the process, I have high hopes for the tonic's ongoing effectiveness. I also hope to have your continued assistance should we need another batch of ingredients!"
