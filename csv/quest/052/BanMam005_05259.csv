※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANMAM005_05259_SEQ_01","Things could scarcely be better for Gok Golma, and as Ruvoll Ja proudly reports the progress you've made, Anggir reminds him of his dream to produce an original dish from his kitchen. Not only does Ruvoll Ja lack any culinary skill, he is adamant that the new cuisine be made in concert with the people of Iq Br'aax. After some deliberation, he decides to ask your mutual friend Ty'at Roh if he knows any master chefs willing to lend a hand.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANMAM005_05259_SEQ_02","Ty'at Roh recommends an elder named Bol Tst'ei for the job. Once a member of the Brethren of Br'aax, the retiree now spends his time mostly in the kitchen, if not out on errands for exotic ingredients."
3,"TEXT_BANMAM005_05259_SEQ_03","Upon seeing Ruvoll Ja before him, Bol Tst'ei's demeanor instantly cools. A combat veteran who grew up on the war stories of endless, bloody conflict, he is not immediately sympathetic to any Mamool Ja's cause. However, Ruvoll Ja's passionate speech convinces him to at least visit Gok Golma and see for himself the real change at work in Mamook."
4,"TEXT_BANMAM005_05259_SEQ_04","Bol Tst'ei is stunned by the abundant gainery─and by an entreaty from the Autarch himself. The veteran chef pledges his skills to realize a new dish, one made with ingredients from Mamook and Iq Br'aax both. Before beginning, however, he asks you to survey Mamook's citizens, that he may learn more about the Mamool Ja palate."
5,"TEXT_BANMAM005_05259_SEQ_05","From tacos to xibruq pibil, it would seem the people of Mamook enjoy a variety of cuisines. Armed with this new information, you report back to Bol Tst'ei."

8,"TEXT_BANMAM005_05259_SEQ_08","The banquet is held successfully, establishing a newfound understanding between the peoples of Iq Br'aax and Mamook. While some scars may never fade, tomorrow will always offer new avenues of hope, if only one chooses to take that first step forward. With Gok Golma's success, Mamook has proven itself not only capable of change but a champion of it, and you can only anticipate with pride the ever-brighter future of a community that once suffered so greatly."
