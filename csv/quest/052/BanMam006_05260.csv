4,"TEXT_BANMAM006_05260_SEQ_04","Anggir is glowing with pride over the gainery's accomplishments and surprises the both of you by seeming to resign her position at Gok Golma before reassuring you of her renewed efforts. Once estranged from his homeland, Ruvoll Ja is now closer to Mamook than ever and proud to call himself a member of its community. From a dark, bleak forest, you have cultivated overflowing and beautiful life, and the Mamool Ja who live in the Ja Tiika Heartland are irrevocably better off for it. Although you know the gainery is more than capable of standing on its own two feet, your dextrous hands will never be unwelcome here as Gok Golma continues to blossom."
