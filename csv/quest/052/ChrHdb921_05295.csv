1,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_01","As if awaiting his cue, Hardiboiled appears just as you approach the anxiously awaiting Nashu. The detective's search for the missing Hildibrand has proven unsuccessful, but after encouraging you to retell the tale of your journey thus far, he pounces on the idea of tracking down the starship instead. To that end, you make your way over to the residential sector, hoping to interview older natives of your world who may have witnessed the original crash landing."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_02","Nashu produces a copy of the starship illustration─complete with her own hand-drawn portrait of Inspector Hildibrand─to aid in your investigation. As she only has one other copy for herself, she insists that you share yours with Detective Hardiboiled."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_03","The detective is eager to begin questioning the park-goers. He suggests showing Nashu's picture to older Hyune and Hhetsarro that might have originally hailed from outside the dome.

4,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_04","Despite your best efforts to jog their memories, the elder residents are unable to help you in your search. Hardiboiled is unwilling to give up, however, and directs you towards a Shetona man he spotted heading towards the 9-14 radius."

6,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_06","You realize some method of transportation is required in order to cross the lake and reach Yuweyawata on the other side.

8,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_08","Satisfied that the place is relatively free of roaming threats, Hardiboiled urges you to take a look around. Somewhere in the mess and debris of the facility may be found a clue as to what became of the starship."
9,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_09","A series of confidential records helps you piece together the story of the starship's discovery and the subsequent experiments performed upon its comatose─yet miraculously unharmed─occupant. Believing you have found Inspector Hildibrand's last known location, you set out to find Detective Hardiboiled and share your promising lead."
10,"TEXT_CHRHDB921_05295_SEQ_10","Verification key in hand, Hardiboiled leads you to the room where the researchers have been preserving Hildibrand in a specimen capsule. Rather than fuss with finding a manual to open this advanced containment unit, however, an explosive egg proffered by Nashu suffices to at last reunite you with the indomitable inspector.

Hildibrand seems none the worse for wear after three decades of hibernation. Hardiboiled marvels at the inspector's still youthful appearance, not to mention his taming of the zombie horde drawn by the commotion, but there appears to be no love lost between the hard-bitten detective and the gentlemanly agent of enquiry. Differences (and similarities) aside, Hardiboiled is nonetheless willing to share the details of the new case he stumbled across within the ominous facility."
