58,"TEXT_BANMAM107_05267_KAGEELJA_000_011","The soil wants for nutrients after the harvest, and any new fields we plow will demand supplementary fertilizer as well, so your contributions will go a long way towards a more bountiful crop. I hope I can count on you again when next our supplies grow sparse."
