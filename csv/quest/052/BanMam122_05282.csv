49,"TEXT_BANMAM122_05282_KAGEELJA_000_001","According to Anggir's research, the light bursts emitted by the branchbearers should amplify the nutritional value of decaying matter, and I'd like to test that theory on our compost beds."
50,"TEXT_BANMAM122_05282_KAGEELJA_000_002","These beds are basically pits where we bury things like fallen leaves, scraps of fish, and manure, then wait for teeny-tiny creatures to turn it all into rich compost. We have several of them situated at the base of trees found around the gainery."
51,"TEXT_BANMAM122_05282_KAGEELJA_000_003","The branchbearers' luminescence had just the effect Anggir predicted, making our compost richer than ever before."
52,"TEXT_BANMAM122_05282_KAGEELJA_000_004","As such, my task for you involves mounting up on one of our bird-shaped plant friends and encouraging it to illuminate each compost bed in turn. Speak to Ziraal Ja to get started."
