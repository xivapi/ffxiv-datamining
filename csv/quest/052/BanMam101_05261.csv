50,"TEXT_BANMAM101_05261_KAGEELJA_000_002","The weeds in the fields seem to sprout nearly as fast as we can pull them. For a mercy, Anggir's weed killer has proven a boon in curbing their growth."
51,"TEXT_BANMAM101_05261_KAGEELJA_000_003","I fear we're running low, however, so I would again ask that you help us procure ingredients."

60,"TEXT_BANMAM101_05261_KAGEELJA_000_016","Excellent! With this, I imagine we'll not want for deterrent for quite some time."
61,"TEXT_BANMAM101_05261_KAGEELJA_000_017","I can still remember when only a few hands were needed to quickly pick the weeds. That we need go to such lengths to contend with them can be frustrating, yet strangely gladdening."
