1,"TEXT_KINGWK101_05253_SEQ_01","The crimson-garbed Loporrit, Namingway, explains that when he was sent to study Etheirys over a hundred years ago, his survey pod suffered critical damage, leaving him stranded with no way of contacting Bestways Burrow. Only recently did he arrive in Old Sharlayan, pursuing rumors of Loporrit sightings, and he is elated to discover the recent advent of moon travel. After directing him to the Tower of Babil, you agree to meet him in Mare Lamentorum so that he might be greeted by a familiar face upon arrival."
2,"TEXT_KINGWK101_05253_SEQ_02","After quite some time trudging through frozen fields and past defunct magitek, Namingway arrives to meet you in Mare Lamentorum. Together, you enter Bestways Burrow, where he is promptly spotted─and interrogated─by Searchingway and the other Loporrits. The revelation that Etheirys need no longer be evacuated comes as a massive shock to Namingway, but Searchingway encourages him to repurpose his skills for a different project: the Cosmic Exploration Initiative. Lured by the prospect of uncharted frontiers, both he and you agree to take part."
3,"TEXT_KINGWK101_05253_SEQ_03","Searchingway explains that the Cosmic Exploration Initiative is headquartered some distance away. Fortunately, you may enlist the aid of Drivingway to be shuttled safely to the base."
4,"TEXT_KINGWK101_05253_SEQ_04","You and Namingway ride the moon rover to the Moongate Hub, where you are welcomed by an eager Searchingway. He has much to tell you about the current state of the project and the assistance he hopes each of you will offer.

※You can now travel to the Moongate Hub by speaking with Drivingway in Bestways Burrow."
5,"TEXT_KINGWK101_05253_SEQ_05","Searchingway shares that the Cosmic Exploration Initiative is run by a diverse crew of volunteers, from Loporrits to Sharlayan academics. Together, the team must construct a vessel for interplanetary travel, the facilities necessary to house and maintain such a vessel, and other machinery required for the exploration of unknown stars. While Namingway is directed to pursue his passion of assigning appellations, Searchingway gives you an exotablet with which to stay apprised of the latest developments and requisitions, and suggests you find missions to participate in as you explore the base."
