49,"TEXT_BANMAM117_05277_KAGEELJA_000_002","Which is why we're embracing the use of Gotoll Ja's smoke bombs. You're familiar with them, yes? The plan is to further improve upon the design and make them in large quantities."
50,"TEXT_BANMAM117_05277_KAGEELJA_000_003","In that respect, the new smoke bombs you helped us make have been highly successful in repelling unwelcome wildlife. Our comrades use them so often that Gotoll Ja has made another request for the base materials."
51,"TEXT_BANMAM117_05277_KAGEELJA_000_005","As the ingredients in question require a delicate touch, however, I was hoping to call upon you and your steady hands to procure them."
52,"TEXT_BANMAM117_05277_KAGEELJA_000_006","One of the main materials─tungsten powder─can be mined near Ankledeep. We'll use it to add an explosive pop to our smoke bombs."

54,"TEXT_BANMAM117_05277_KAGEELJA_000_008","One of these materials─the smokeshell─can be fished up from Ankledeep.  As the name implies, it provides the base component for the billowing cloud our bombs produce."

61,"TEXT_BANMAM117_05277_KAGEELJA_000_017","Word from Gotoll Ja is that we'll be making our new smoke bombs much more compact than the ones used to scare off the rampaging wivres."
