※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_01","At young R'tcha's word, your little adventure to Oschon's Torch begins. Ayoyo suggests first striking east to Madman Bridge, and thither do you make your way.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_02","As you take in the sights at Madman Bridge, R'tcha reveals that her parents died in the Calamity, and she lives at an orphanage. After taking a moment to digest this revelation, your party continues on south, to Oschon's Embrace."
3,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_03","At the dizzying heights of Oschon's Embrace, R'tcha again brings up the subject of her parents, but struggles to express herself. As she wrestles with her thoughts, she presses on to the Gods' Grip, with you and Ayoyo following after her."
4,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_04","At length Oschon's Torch comes into view, and the mention of its keeper spurs R'tcha to divulge more about her parents. The two were lighthouse keepers who went missing when the Calamity struck, and R'tcha had been torn between wanting to disprove the rumor that they had become vengeful spirits and meeting them again. Seemingly finding courage in voicing her feelings, she continues resolutely on her way."
5,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_05","Further along the road, your party makes a brief stop at a vantage point to marvel at the impossible landscape wrought by the Calamity. The view impresses upon R'tcha the scale of the destruction, and she cannot help but wonder how her parents had felt that fateful day. Without further word, she sets off for the lighthouse ahead, there to speak with its keeper Rostnzeh and come face-to-face with the truth."
6,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_06","It is with mixed feelings that R'tcha learns from Rostnzeh that no ghosts haunt any lighthouse he knows. The man had been acquainted with R'tcha's parents, however, and he gladly shares what he remembers of them. When the Calamity unleashed a monstrous tidal wave on Vylbrand, the couple had fought desperately to protect their lighthouse. Though they lost their lives in the trying, they saved full many by doing their duty to the last. The knowledge serves to comfort R'tcha, and at Rostnzeh's invitation, you stay the night to hear more tales about her parents. So it is that R'tcha attains closure, and inspired by her parents' bravery, she resolves to become someone who helps others."
7,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_07","Back at the Aftcastle, you bid a fond farewell to your companions. Ayoyo informs you that the wandering minstrel has taken himself to the Anchor Yard, and you seek him out to report on the success of your excursion."
8,"TEXT_FESANX102_05298_SEQ_08","The minstrel listens intently as you recount your adventure with young R'tcha. The tale provides him with the inspiration he sought, and he proceeds to compose a verse in your presence. No sooner does he strum out a chord on his harp than you find yourself whisked away to a mysterious place, where you are greeted by the enigmatic Naoki Yoshida. The man thanks you for the stories you have woven, and expresses his excitement for those you have yet to weave, before returning you to the Anchor Yard. There, as spectacular fireworks fill the night sky with vibrant color, the minstrel performs his new song─a song of journeys fulfilling, which he dedicates to you, who bring joy through the stories you gather and deliver. No matter how great your burdens, these same stories shall be your strength─a beacon to light your way in the darkness."
