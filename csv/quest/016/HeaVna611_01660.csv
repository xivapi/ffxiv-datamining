1,"TEXT_HEAVNA611_01660_SEQ_01","Matoya shares with you the tale of her work on a device known as an aetheric converger, and how it led to a bitter falling-out between her and her peers. The fruits of her research were apparently compiled within a tome which now lies sealed within the Great Gubal Library, and you must overcome the dangers within if you wish to retrieve it. Ask Matoya for further instructions."

Upon leaving Matoya's Cave, you are to make your way east; the library building will come into view upon gaining the collapsed bridge. Speak with Broomsy when you arrive, and he will unlock the door for you."
