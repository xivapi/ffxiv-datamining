3,"TEXT_HEAVNA306_01607_SEQ_03","After fruitlessly interrogating dragonslayers of all descriptions, the lowborn soldier, Pierriquet, finally provides you with a valuable piece of information. According to him, heretics in the western highlands are summoned with purple-hued signal smoke. Perhaps your quarry can be made to come to you..."
