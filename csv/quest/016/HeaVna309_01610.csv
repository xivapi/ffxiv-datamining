1,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_SEQ_01","Marcechamp tells you of the beast tribe known as the Gnath, and of their recent acts of unprovoked hostility. According to the hunter, no one in the region─not even the mighty Dravanians─has been spared the insect-like people's aggression. Ask Ysayle how this development might affect your plans."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_SEQ_02","Ysayle recalls how she came to stay in the village of Tailfeather some years before, during which period the Gnath seemed a territorial but otherwise passive tribe. Unconcerned by the recent change in the beastmen's behavior, Estinien urges the party to cut a straight path through to Sohm Al. Follow the forest trail to the Stained One, and defeat any foes who stand in your way."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_SEQ_03","On the way to the Stained One, you are set upon by the Gnath, but soon give them cause to regret their choice of target. Press on towards your destination, eliminating any who seek to bar your path."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_SEQ_04","After advancing what feels like no more than a few yalms, you are set upon by another party of Gnath─who fare little better than their predecessors. Stay on the trail, and make for the Stained One where you are to rendezvous with Alphinaud and the others."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_SEQ_05","You arrive at the ruins, and are soon joined by the rest of your companions. When Ysayle claims that the site is a remnant of the age when her ancestors and the Dravanians lived in harmony, Estinien accuses her of peddling heretic falsehoods, prompting an exasperated Alphinaud to step in. After demanding that the pair set aside their differences for the good of the mission, he declares that their debate will presently be settled by the indisputable visions granted you by the Echo. Though you know that your gift is rarely so obliging, you say nothing. It is time to move on."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_MARCECHAMP_000_001","They never used to stray far from their hives out of fear of the dragons, but they've gotten a lot more aggressive of late, sendin' out war parties for malms in all directions."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_MARCECHAMP_000_002","They've even taken to harassin' the Dravanians in their own lairs, if you can believe it."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_MARCECHAMP_000_003","An' when they venture into the forest─which is more an' more, by the way─they certainly ain't afraid to come after my lot. I can only imagine how much worse it'd be closer to the Gnath's home territory..."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_MARCECHAMP_000_004","Now listen here, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>son</If>: if you're set on headin' west, you'd best keep your ears peeled for the angry clicks of Gnath mandibles, or you'll find yourself staring into a set."
53,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ALPHINAUD_000_005","I have read widely of the world and its wonders, yet after taking but a few steps into the unknown, I am reminded how much I have still to discover."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ESTINIEN_000_006","These hunters scrabble in the shadow of dragons for naught but the love of coin. Greed inspires courage and madness in equal measure, it seems."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_007","I am glad to see Marcechamp is doing well."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_010","'Twould seem that much has changed in Dravania. The Gnath were not wont to cause such strife when I lived here."
57,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ALPHINAUD_000_011","You lived here? In Dravania?"
58,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_012","Aye, 'twas in the time following the Calamity. My family was dead, my home was gone, and I had fled from the bitter cold into these lands. I knew not the paths of the forest then, and wandered out from under the protection of its boughs."
59,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_013","That was when I chanced upon Hraesvelgr. He had descended from his mountain lair to hunt for food."
60,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_014","My exhausted mind could not contend with the sight of the majestic wyrm─nor the vision of the past his presence visited upon me. Thankfully, Marcechamp found my unconscious form at the edge of the trees, and nursed me back to health. And in Tailfeather I remained for some time."
61,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ALPHINAUD_000_015","...Hence your familiarity with the locals. But I interrupted you─you were saying these Gnath were once a peaceful people?"
62,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_016","“Peaceful” would not be the most fitting description. They are a fiercely territorial tribe, and any who intrude upon their domain are attacked without hesitation or quarter."
63,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_017","Outside the borders of their homeland, however, they were rarely hostile. Indeed, we were even able to trade with them on occasion."
64,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ESTINIEN_000_018","They have changed, then. What of it? We have not the time to creep through the underbrush on some roundabout route. I say we make straight for Sohm Al and crush any unruly insect we meet underfoot."
65,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_019","A more direct path, then. Very well. Let us first follow the trail west out of the forest, and make for the statue of the Stained One."
66,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_020","From there, we should have a fair view of the road that leads to Sohm Al. Shall we...?"

This land is ours!"
68,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ALPHINAUD_000_030","Should we chance to meet Marcechamp again, remind me to thank him. Had he not warned us to expect the Gnath, I doubt I would be standing here."
69,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ALPHINAUD_000_031","...Amid ruins that I would tentatively describe as Ishgardian...? The style, if not quite identical, betrays a definite resemblance..."
70,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_032","You have a scholar's eye, Master Alphinaud. This structure is, in fact, over a thousand years old. It is a remnant of the age when our ancestors and dragonkind lived together in peace."
71,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ESTINIEN_000_033","Hmph. You claim this as evidence of our harmonious past? I was taught that these buildings were constructed by heretics, in honor of your Dravanian masters. This rubble inspires no such awe in me..."
72,"TEXT_HEAVNA309_01610_ICEHEART_000_034","Stubborn fool. How desperately you cling to the false teachings of your beloved Holy See!"
