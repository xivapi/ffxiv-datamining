0,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_SEQ_00","Tataru has news for you from Ul'dah."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_SEQ_01","Tataru excitedly explains that there has been a significant development in the search for the sultana, and that General Raubahn has requested your assistance. Travel to Vesper Bay in western Thanalan, and join your allies inside the Waking Sands."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_SEQ_02","At the Waking Sands, you are shocked to learn that the sultana is most likely being kept in a poison-induced sleep somewhere within the palace. Before any attempt is made to rescue her, however, your allies deem it prudent to track down her poisoner and identify the substance used to taint Nanamo's wine. Ask Yugiri to explain exactly what is required of you."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_SEQ_03","Yugiri has information that Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting, is hiding somewhere in the Silver Bazaar. Question the inhabitants of the hamlet, and confirm the reclusive poisoner's whereabouts."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_SEQ_04","You question the residents of the Silver Bazaar, and learn that Meriel has indeed returned to the market settlement. Search each dwelling, and find the sultana's former lady-in-waiting."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_SEQ_05","Before Raubahn can wring the truth from the trembling Meriel, Lolorito appears and proceeds to reveal the details of the assassination plot. All of his actions, he claims, were intended to expose Teledji Adeledji, and ensure the stability of Ul'dah. As proof of his good intentions, he then presents the Flame General with the means to rouse the sultana from her deathlike state. Speak with Alphinaud, and learn his thoughts on this most unexpected development."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_SEQ_06","Though undoubtedly gladdened by the prospect of the sultana's coming “resurrection,” you sense that Alphinaud's presiding feeling is one of relief at the avoidance of a bloodbath. Rather than join your fellow Scion in contemplating how much worse things might have been, you resolve instead to give thanks. It has, after all, been a good day for Ul'dah."

51,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_ALPHINAUD_000_003","Tataru─have our friends at the Congregation send a message to Estinien. Tell him we have identified a solution to our problem, but that it will take some time to prepare."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_TATARU_000_004","As you wish, Master Alphinaud!"

54,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_ALPHINAUD_000_006","I am as intrigued as you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Shall we hear what news Tataru has brought us?"
55,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_URIANGER_000_010","The Dunesfolk have long laced their teas with traces of venom, that they might better survive in a land rife with deadly snakes and scorpions. 'Tis all but certain that Her Grace hath nurtured a similar resistance to such substances... Might not this explain the need for so noticeable a quantity of alchemical supplies? In moderation, full many poisons serve as palliatives, after all..."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_ALPHINAUD_000_011","If one had chosen to entrap the sultana in a deathlike sleep rather than slay her, then one would surely also know of a means to rouse her from said state. There <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> be an antidote to this poison."
57,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_HIGIRI_000_012","Raubahn's recovery has been nothing short of miraculous. But I should not be surprised. By his scars, I gather that he has survived many terrible wounds."
58,"TEXT_HEAVNA329_01630_YUGIRI_000_020","Our target is Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting─a woman of Midlander heritage. I am told the two of you have met."
