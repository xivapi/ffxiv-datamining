1,"TEXT_JOBDRG501_01689_SEQ_01","Ser Alberic informs you that a host of dragons has been wreaking havoc within Ishgardian territory. Though the Holy See's best dragoons have been dispatched to deal with the threat, they are sorely outnumbered and are struggling to gain the upper hand. Even now, a unit is locked in a fierce struggle northwest of Whitebrim Front, and is in dire need of reinforcements. Ser Alberic means to answer the call, and bids you join him. Make haste to the location of the battle."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG501_01689_SEQ_02","With your aid, the Ishgardians succeed in putting the enemy to rout. Shortly thereafter, Ser Alberic arrives in the company of another dragoon, who introduces herself as Heustienne, one of your instructors during your trials. Impressed by your distinct fighting style, she asks to be taken on as your pupil. Consider her request, and convey your decision to Ser Alberic at the Observatorium."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG501_01689_SEQ_03","You have agreed to accept Heustienne as your pupil. “As we teach, so too do we learn”─with these words in mind, go forth and strive to reach new heights as a dragoon.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic upon reaching level 52."

62,"TEXT_JOBDRG501_01689_ALBERIC_000_016","I believe I know the reason why. As an adventurer, you have done battle with foes the realm over. Through these many encounters, your techniques have evolved to produce a style that sets you apart from we who fight dragons exclusively."
