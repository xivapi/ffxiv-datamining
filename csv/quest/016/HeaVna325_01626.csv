1,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_SEQ_01","To your frustration, Moghan insists that with the winds blowing as they are, Hraesvelgr is unlikely to be found at Zenith. It would seem you have no choice but to make yourself comfortable, and wait for the weather to turn. Join the moogle in the clearing to the southeast of the wyrm's palace, and inquire if there is anything you can do to make the time pass more quickly."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_SEQ_02","Alphinaud has left to gather wood for a fire, but Estinien seems concerned by the youth's distracted air. Follow after your fellow Scion, and see that he returns safely."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_SEQ_03","You have slain the creatures lurking in Alphinaud's vicinity. Return to the clearing, and reassure Estinien that all is well."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_SEQ_04","You and your companions enjoy the warmth of the crackling campfire, speaking of the road you have traveled, and the lessons you have learned. But though shared adversity has brought you closer together, tensions yet simmer between Estinien and Ysayle. You can only hope that tomorrow's negotiations will bring a final resolution to their─and Ishgard's─conflict..."

76,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_ICEHEART_000_018","We all of us are guilty of similar ignorance. How many men lay down their lives, never knowing what it is that they fight for? Never questioning that which they have been taught to believe?"
77,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_ICEHEART_000_019","'Twas only upon meeting Hraesvelgr that I learned the truth hidden within our history. Were it not for that chance encounter, I would never have vowed to tear down the Holy See, and expunge the falsehoods with which it fans the flames of conflict. I would have lived and died in ignorance. That the truth has driven me to do terrible things, I cannot deny, but I would rather sin in the pursuit of peace than imagine myself virtuous for perpetuating a needless war."

82,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_ESTINIEN_000_024","But for all that such an age existed, we are now in a time of war. Nidhogg killed my family, and no quirk of history will exonerate him."
