1,"TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_SEQ_01","You return with Alphinaud to the Zundu village, only to find it overrun with imperial troops. Their commanding officer, whom you quickly deduce to be Regula van Hydrus, hears your approach and demands you reveal yourselves. Seeing no other way to ensure the survival of the captured Vanu, you obey, and soon find yourself face-to-face with Varis zos Galvus, the newly crowned Emperor of Garlemald.

Recognizing you and Alphinaud on sight, the Emperor surmises that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn seek Azys Lla in order to learn how the Allagans bound primals to their will. Pricked by Varis's presumption, Alphinaud musters the courage to decry the Empire's actions, only to be brushed aside by the Emperor, who orders his men to execute the captive Vanu Vanu regardless. Yet before they can carry out his command, the soldiers are sent reeling by a sudden barrage of cannon fire, and Lucia, piloting a suit of magitek armor, rushes to your side. Alert to the danger, Regula orders an immediate withdrawal, covered by the guns of the imperial battleship overhead, and though the resulting smoke obscures their retreat, the Emperor's voice─and its promise of a reunion─is unmistakable."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_SEQ_02","Concerned that imperial troops may have attacked the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> as well, Alphinaud bids you return to Cid while he and Lucia inform the Zundu of Bismarck's demise. Return to the airship and confirm that all is well."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_SEQ_03","After learning that the engineers did not run afoul of the Garleans, you recount the tale of your meeting with the Emperor to Cid, who reacts more or less as you expected he would. Alphinaud and Lucia return shortly thereafter and inform you that, miraculously, no Zundu died in the imperial raid. Reasoning that Varis would have leveled the Vanu settlement by now if that were his intention, Alphinaud concludes that the Emperor has already fixed his sights on Azys Lla. Happily, repairs to the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> are complete, and the hunt for the archbishop can continue in earnest."
