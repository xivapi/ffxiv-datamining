0,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_SEQ_00","Adversity acquaints a man with strange bedfellows, as Alphinaud knows only too well."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_SEQ_01","Even with an army of knights, a direct assault on the Vault would be fruitless. However, were you to enlist the aid of the revolutionaries hiding in the Brume, Lucia believes you may yet have a chance of success. Together with Alphinaud, go and speak with Tataru at the Forgotten Knight and see what she knows of the revolutionaries and their leader."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_SEQ_02","Tataru knows little and less of the gang you seek, save for the moniker of their leader: the Mongrel. For lack of a better option, Alphinaud bids you take to the streets and question the residents of the Brume."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_SEQ_03","As expected, the people are not wont to speak of the revolutionaries in their midst. Inform Alphinaud of your failure."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_SEQ_04","Alphinaud seems wholly unconcerned by your lack of success. And little wonder: one cannot simply ask where a gang of notorious outlaws is hiding and expect to receive an honest answer. By way of consolation, your fruitless efforts <Emphasis>have</Emphasis> lent credence to Alphinaud's theory that the revolutionaries are being sheltered by the populace..."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_LUCIA_000_001","You are correct, Master Alphinaud. Not even the assembled might of House Fortemps and the Temple Knights would be sufficient. With the support of another party, however, we may yet stand a chance."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_ALPHINAUD_000_002","You speak of one of the other High Houses?"
51,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_LUCIA_000_003","Precisely the opposite. I speak of the revolutionaries rumored to reside in the Brume."

57,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_ALPHINAUD_000_009","Very well. We shall seek out the leader of these revolutionaries, and make our case."

73,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_TATARU_000_027","At first, the people here were a bit standoffish, but with a little effort─and a lot of parley─I've managed to make plenty of friends!"

82,"TEXT_HEAVNA402_01638_ALPHINAUD_000_060","Not a single shred of information? Just as I expected. These revolutionaries would not have evaded capture for so long without the masses' complicity. Still, it is good to know that Tataru's ears are as sharp as ever."
