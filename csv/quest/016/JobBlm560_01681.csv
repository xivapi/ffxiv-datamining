1,"TEXT_JOBBLM560_01681_SEQ_01","Lalai tells you of a letter she received from Dozol Meloc. He is hiding from someone at Alder Springs, and asks urgently for your assistance. It is clear that, as was the case with Da Za, this is the work of the Defiant. Travel to Alder Springs and stop them before anything happens to Dozol Meloc. Lalai will inform Zhai'a Nelhah of the letter."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM560_01681_SEQ_02","You find Dozol Meloc surrounded by Defiant mages ready to attack. You intervene and they soon fall to your dark magicks. Assist the Ixali mage and confirm that he is unharmed."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM560_01681_SEQ_03","You have successfully defended Dozol Meloc from the Defiant mages. As he is thanking you for your help, Zhai'a Nelhah arrives. He once again berates you for slaying every last attacker─again leaving not one alive to be questioned─before realizing that they appear to have been burned alive <Emphasis>from the inside</Emphasis>. Dozol Meloc suggests that, without the Gem of Shatotto to control their dark magicks, the very aether within their bodies ignited when they resorted to their most powerful spells. Zhai'a Nelhah offers his apologies for blaming you for the previous deaths before leaving. Dozol Meloc is safe and the Defiant mages have been defeated. Return to Ul'dah and report to Lalai."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM560_01681_SEQ_04","You tell Lalai what happened. She points out that the Defiant's inability to utilize their powers without dying horrible, fiery deaths probably hinders their ability to recruit new members. This explains the desperation with which they approached your beastman allies. Although you have no information to assist in locating Waldeve and his cult, they are in no position to stay in hiding. Frantic for answers, they will soon be forced to reveal themselves. You need simply wait for that moment.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 58."
