5,"TEXT_HEAVNA203_01601_SEQ_05","Alphinaud is sufficiently convinced that the messenger and his mistress can be trusted. Do as bade and make your way to western Thanalan, where your old haunt the Waking Sands still stands."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNA203_01601_SEQ_06","Upon arriving at the Waking Sands, you are greeted by a number of familiar faces─Urianger, Pipin, and Papashan. Soon after, it is revealed that the messenger's mistress is no less an individual than Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal and member of the Syndicate. To Raubahn's immense relief, she confirms Alphinaud's suspicion that Nanamo is still alive, and goes on to speculate that the sultana may be confined somewhere in a state of induced slumber. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on these revelations."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNA203_01601_SEQ_07","Alphinaud thanks you for your part in Raubahn's rescue. With the Flame General safe, your work in Ul'dah is done for now."
