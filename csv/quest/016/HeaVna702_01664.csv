5,"TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_SEQ_05","With a little prompting, the node furnishes you with a destination: the Aetherochemical Research Facility, situated upon the Flagship. Though it is unclear what the archbishop seeks in the area marked “Triad Control,” you can be sure no good will come of it."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_002","Good. Now, unless I'm mistaken, this used to be an airship landing, and a major one at that. From what I know of Allagan design, there should be a terminal nearby that's linked to the isle's operational heart."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_003","If we can find such a terminal, we should be able to learn something of the archbishop's whereabouts. Let's split up and look for it."

61,"TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_BIGGS_000_020","The Empire borrowed most of its technology from Allagan relics. If we can find the terminal, I reckon we can operate it."

99,"TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_ALPHINAUD_000_084","And what manner of place is that?"
100,"TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_085","It is, and I quote, “a regulation facility for the 'Warring Triad' test subjects.” And that's all it says. The rest of the information is only accessible to users with consular privileges."
