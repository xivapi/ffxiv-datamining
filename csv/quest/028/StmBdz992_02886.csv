1,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_01","Gundobald would like to commemorate the life of Wilred, who died fighting for the Crystal Braves. He hands you the warrior's old sword and bids you present it to Bertliana, Wilred's childhood friend."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_02","Bertliana recovers from the initial shock of seeing her friend's sword to introduce herself to you. She goes on to explain that it has long been her dream to someday take one of Wilred's belongings with her to Ala Mhigo, if it was liberated during her lifetime. Bertliana sets about packing the blade up and asks you to inform Gundobald that she will soon be ready to depart."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_03","Gundobald clearly thinks highly of Bertliana─noting that she has done incredibly well to overcome all the hardships she has had to endure. You are given a list containing the names of the first group that has decided to make the journey to their homeland and asked to see if they still harbor any doubts about the move."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_04","Everyone you speak with has their own worries, but you are able to reassure them that everything will be fine. You head back to Gundobald to relay that the group is now ready to make tracks."

50,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_002","I have been thinking a lot about Wilred of late. How he lost his life fighting for the Crystal Braves."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_003","I've been holding onto his sword ever since his passing. He, more than anyone, burned with a strong desire to take back Ala Mhigo, which is why I would like to send his sword with the group─that part of him may finally go home."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_004","I have a mind to entrust you and Bertliana with this task. She had been friends with Wilred ever since they were but children."

54,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_006","Take Wilred's sword to Bertliana. She will know how best to honor his memory. I shall continue to hold on to the boy's old uniform."

56,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_BERTLIANA_000_011","I could never forget to whom this blade belonged. Thank you for bringing it to me."
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_BERTLIANA_000_012","But where are my manners. I know we have met before, but I have yet to introduce myself. I am Bertliana. I was good friends with Wilred."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_BERTLIANA_000_013","I had always hoped that if I lived to see Ala Mhigo liberated I could take his short sword there."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_BERTLIANA_000_014","I once heard from my grandmother that there is a spot in the Lochs where people honor their fallen comrades. I wish to take Wilred's sword there."

64,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_022","I am confident the two of you will do a fine job of commemorating Wilred's life. Once things have calmed down a bit I too shall go and pay my own respects."
65,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_023","At any rate, I imagine the first lot should be ready to depart by now."
66,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_024","I will give you a list of those who make up the group. Could you ask around and see if they have any concerns?"

69,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_ANXIOUSMAN02887_000_030","I lived in Ala Mhigo until I was five or so─the very age my own boy is now. I do worry whether or not he'll be able to adjust to a new life over there..."

74,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_ANXIOUSMAN02887_000_032","That is true. I remember it didn't take me too long to adjust to life away from Ala Mhigo when I was his age."
75,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_ANXIOUSMAN02887_000_033","Thank you for listening to my worries. I have dreamed of returning for so long, and yet now the moment is here I find myself incredibly anxious. However, I know it will work out somehow."
