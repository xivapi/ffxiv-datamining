58,"TEXT_STMBDZ808_02836_JGHONAKO_000_015","My coffers have been running a bit dry ever since the Garleans left. Not that I enjoyed their company, mind you. I did what I had to do to get by. The Resistance, however, is a different story. I'll gladly offer my services to the brave men and women who fought to save our home."

65,"TEXT_STMBDZ808_02836_CIVILIAN02836_000_022","Hmmm... Thanks, but no. I appreciate the Resistance chasin' off the Garleans, but what happens when they come back? If worse comes to worst, I don't want anyone callin' me no Resistance lover."

68,"TEXT_STMBDZ808_02836_LIBERATOR02836_000_031","I see... <sigh> Well, at least now I know how they really feel about us. Suppose I can't blame them."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ808_02836_LIBERATOR02836_000_032","A few of them do seem willing to open up to us, though, so that's a start."
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ808_02836_LIBERATOR02836_000_033","It's going to take time, but I'm sure the Resistance will earn their trust. Until then, we'll keep fighting to keep them safe, and maybe someday this will all seem like a distant memory."
71,"TEXT_STMBDZ808_02836_LIBERATOR02836_000_034","Thanks again for your help. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare for our first forum with the townsfolk."
