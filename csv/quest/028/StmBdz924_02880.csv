50,"TEXT_STMBDZ924_02880_BETHA_000_002","You have probably heard how the Empire took great pains to quash the religions of this land, for fear of the appearance of primals. But the imperials even went so far as to forbid the harmless ceremonies folk performed to honor their fallen."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ924_02880_BETHA_000_003","As a result, the Lochs are now haunted by a host of restless shades who were denied their last rites. And sadly, brute force is the only way to banish them."

57,"TEXT_STMBDZ924_02880_BETHA_000_012","But although our conquerors permitted me to build him a gravestone, they would not allow me to perform his final rites as the teachings of the Fist of Rhalgr demanded."
