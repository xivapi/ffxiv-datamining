50,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_002","But in our line of work tomorrow is never a certainty. To lose her before making my feelings known would be more than my heart can bear."

60,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_017","In all my time as a conjurer I have never struck a blow against an enemy. There was always some ploy at my disposal, a clever use of the terrain to outmaneuver my enemies. But the barren lands of Gyr Abania would afford me no such luxury."
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_018","I stood precariously on a knife's edge and could feel I would soon fall. I dared not look to see what was waiting for me below. My only thought was I wanted to live. I wanted to live!"
62,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_019","The imperial sword came crashing down. I braced myself for the end. What filled the air next was not my cries of agony, but the sweet song of steel against steel. I then opened my eyes to an amazing sight. At first I thought it a bean sprout jumping furiously to and fro, but lo and behold, it was Kakalai!"
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_020","I began casting healing magicks and I could not take my eyes off him. He was poetry in motion."
64,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_021","Before long the imperials all lay defeated. The only sound to be heard was his labored breathing and mine."
65,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_022","He then ran off to join the fray elsewhere, but for one moment─one magical moment─our eyes met. When I looked into those glorious emerald green eyes of his, I knew he was the one."
66,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_023","My sweet angel still lives. And to think he would send me such a letter!"
67,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_024","After losing my parents twenty years ago I had always been filled with such hate, such anger. All I lived for was revenge against the Garleans."
68,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_025","But those days are done. Love has found me and I will never let it go! Here, would you take this flower to him? Tell him I would bask in his love like this blossom in sunlight."

73,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_032","My sweet, sweet Athala. Would you like to hear of how we met? Of how I came to meet an angel on the battlefield?"

77,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_036","My unit had been crushed utterly by a magitek menace set upon us by the imperials. It was all I could do to escape. I honestly had no idea where I was going. I only knew that death was at my back. Before I knew it, I was careening into a soldier, and I instinctively readied my blade."
78,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_037","I defeated him with relative ease, but sadly he was not alone. More soldiers beyond counting stood before me, and a mechanical monster still giving chase behind. In that moment I grew tired of it all. Tired of running, tired of living. So I rushed headlong into the throng of soldiers."
79,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_038","I swung my sword wildly, caring not for the blows they made against me. Where there should have been pain, there was only a soothing breeze blowing against my back. I felt reinvigorated, and so I kept fighting down to the last man. It was only then that I looked back."
80,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_039","What I saw there behind me I can describe only as perfection. The gods must have grown jealous of her beauty and cast her down from the heavens."
81,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_040","But my sweet angel was not yet free from danger. The magitek drone was still following me. So I ran before it was close enough to open fire on the both of us. "
82,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_041","I ran and ran until I found a support unit of the Allied forces. I was safe...and in love."
83,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_042","It is unfair to say that I saved her. No, she is the one who saved me. When next we receive our wages I will have to get her something."
84,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_043","A ring, perhaps..."
