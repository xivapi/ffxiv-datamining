Ul Thon needs yet another way to become popular."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZC103_03406_SEQ_01","Far from ready to give up on becoming popular, Ul Thon looks to you once more for advice. Nodding sagely at your words, they decide upon doing something to make their fellow pixies happy: making them a gift of flowers. To that end, you are tasked with picking the vibrant blossoms that bloom at Timh Gyeus.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZC103_03406_SEQ_02","You manage to gather a good variety of blossoms, and take them over to Ul Thon."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZC103_03406_SEQ_03","Pleased with your colorful contribution, Ul Thon says that they will arrange the blossoms in nice containers before presenting them to everyone. It is decided that the amiable pixie will be the first recipient, and together you make your way back to Lydha Lran."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZC103_03406_SEQ_04","To Ul Thon's delight, the flowers are very well received by the amiable pixie. However, before they can offer the gift to others, two distraught pixies arrive with word of trouble. It appears that a pixie named Hagan Nee is being chased by a monstrous fiend, and if you do not act quickly, they will most certainly meet an unspeakable end."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZC103_03406_ULTHON_000_016","So, we're going to need flowers, and lots of them. Please help me pick the vibrant blossoms that grow in Il Mheg. The more colors we have, the better!"
