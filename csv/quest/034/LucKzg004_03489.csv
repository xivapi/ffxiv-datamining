56,"TEXT_LUCKZG004_03489_RHILRIL_000_032","What!? Nothing but junk! Rusty junk, at that! Why would anyone bury this? Wait, is that a diary? I am sure the former owner will not mind if I take a peek... "
57,"TEXT_LUCKZG004_03489_RHILRIL_000_033","Hmm... It looks like the owner had to leave Amh Araeng but was planning to come back one day."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZG004_03489_RHILRIL_000_034","And if that day ever came, they wanted to dig up the diary and continue writing their life story."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZG004_03489_RHILRIL_000_035","I wonder if that person is still alive... Probably not, judging by the state of this chest. It must have been buried for a long time. Maybe their children, or their children's children will come in search of it."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZG004_03489_RHILRIL_000_036","If I read the rest, maybe I can learn who this person was... And then I will put it back, in a more sturdy box. And since there was no treasure to share, I will give you this instead as payment for your hard work!"
