49,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_100_002","Words can't explain how grateful I am... Thank you."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_VARTHON_000_001","Sorry we put you through all this. Karnes seems well enough to walk now, so I'll see him back to Slitherbough."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_002","Actually, there's one last thing I wish to do while we're here."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_003","If we're ever to rebuild Fort Gohn, something has to be done about the animals that wander about the ruins."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_004","Which is why I boiled meat in a stew of poisonous mushrooms and snake venom. I was planning to place it around the ruins for the raptors to eat."

55,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_006","Master Matoya isn't here, and no one ever goes to Fort Gohn, so they'll never have to know. We'll cover the west side of the ruins, you take the east."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_VARTHON_100_010","Just the smell of it makes my stomach turn. I almost feel bad for the raptors..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_010","Good, you've finished. Our side is taken care of as well."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_VARTHON_000_011","We should leave before our clothes begin to smell of the stuff."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_VARTHON_100_020","It's good to be back. I hope we haven't been too much of a bother."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_020","Sorry again for dragging you into my troubles."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_VARTHON_000_021","I'm just glad you weren't seriously hurt. You better tell me the next time you plan to do something crazy like that."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_022","There won't be a next time, I promise. I can't afford to be reckless if I'm ever to be a match for my father."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_023","Thank you again for all your help."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_024","It's only a pile of rubble now, but someday I'll rebuild Fort Gohn. You wait and see."

67,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_027","You'll come and visit, won't you? We can hold a grand feast in your honor─to the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who helped make it all possible."
