49,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_002","As an ally of Ronka, it may serve you well to see how we Viis ensure the safety of our sacred sites. Do you not agree?"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_003","Splendid! Very well, we begin at once. I shall await you at Bowrest."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_010","Shhh! We must be quiet. Look there, in the brush. A pair of afflicted does seeks refuge, but they cannot escape their fate. I shall draw them out─you do the rest."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_011","Do not hesitate! Your prey is before you!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_030","What skill! Truly you are worthy of your title. I only said your prey was weakened to embolden you, but it appears that was unnecessary."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_031","Well then, let us proceed. You have proven your mettle, so it would be best for us to patrol separate routes from now on."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_032","Look after the area near the Wild Fete. I shall depart to the Morning Stars."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_033","Once you have finished, meet back here. Be safe."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_SYSTEM03464_000_040","An arrow pierces the hide of the caracal. It appears to have fallen in a single shot."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_050","You are returned already. I take it your patrol was as uneventful as mine."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_051","What? A single arrow? Impossible...can it be?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_052","(-Frightened Voice-)Gaaaaaahhh!"
61,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_053","Did you hear that? From deep in the wood...someone crying out for help. She may be in danger─we must help!"
62,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_060","As we feared, she was attacked. Luckily, a Watcher struck down her aggressor before she came to any serious harm. An uncommon occurrence, but it is not unheard of to see one while they are hunting."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_061","Doubtless the caracal you sighted was his doing as well. He must have fled into the wood when you arrived."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_062","At any rate, we must treat her. Let us return to Fanow."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_070","That was quite eventful for a first patrol. To think that you would meet one of the wood's Watchers."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_071","Hmm, perhaps 'meet' is not the right word. If only I could have introduced you as one of Ronka's allies. Alas, it seems that our guardian had other plans."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZF005_03464_VIISHUNTER03464_000_072","The day was far from a disappointment, however. With your help we were able to guide a wounded ally to safety. You are welcome to join me again any time you wish."
