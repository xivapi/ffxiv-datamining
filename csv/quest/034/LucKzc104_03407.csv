49,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_PIXIEC03406_000_001","(-Panicked Pixie-)No, the other one─Handmirror Lake. You'll help us, won't you, mortal?"

51,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_A1_000_000","Just leave it to me!"

54,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_005","Wait, I'm coming with you! I'm scared, if truth be told...but a pixie who protects their fellows is a popular pixie!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_010","B-But I can't fight or anything. What good am I to you? And yet...a pixie who protects their fellows is a popular pixie!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_015","You'd forsake us in our time of need!? Oh, forget you, then! I'll go and rescue Hagan Nee alone!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_016","...Ahhh! I see what you're doing, you sly mortal! You want to tell me that a pixie who protects their fellows is a popular pixie, isn't that right?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_PIXIEC03406_000_017","(-Panicked Pixie-)Be that as it may, it's too dangerous by yourself! The two of you should go together!"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_100_020","Right, we'll take care of this! You two, wait in the village!"
60,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_020","Handmirror Lake lies to the northwest. Let's hurry there and look for Hagan Nee!"
61,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_030","This should be the spot, but Hagan Nee doesn't seem to be here anymore... I'll try calling out."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_031","Hagan Nee! Where are you!?"
63,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_032","Nothing. We'll just have to─"
64,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_033","Did you hear that!? It was a scream, and it came from over there! Come on!"
65,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_050","Unnngh..."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_060","Oh no, they're hurt..."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_061","I know some simple healing spells. I'll see what I can do."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_062","A-Amazing! I feel like a new pixie! Ul Thon, I didn't know you could heal so well!"
69,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_063","I went to pick a flower, but it turned out to be that fiend's head. If it weren't for you, I would be a dead pixie."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_064","I merely tended your wounds. It was this mortal here who saved you from the beast."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_065","Well then, I'm in both your debts! Thank you!"
72,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_066","Heh, it's a fine feeling to be thanked... Come, we should head back to Lydha Lran as well."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_070","As much as I want to become popular, I never could've braved such dangers alone. Thank you for giving me the courage."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_071","Of course, the most important thing is Hagan Nee is safe. And now we can return to the business of making me popular..."
75,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_072","Hm? What's this, now?"
76,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_073","(-Hagan Nee-)I went and told everyone how you helped me. And now everyone wants you to help them too!"
77,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_074","(-Hagan Nee-)Some are hurt and need healing. Others need a hand harvesting plants in dangerous places. And what's this we hear about you gifting flowers to everyone?"
78,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_075","Oh! Of...of course! I'll take care of everyone in turn. The healing, the harvesting, the gifts─everything!"
79,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_076","(-Hagan Nee-)Great! We'll leave you to it, then!"
80,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_077","To have everyone depend on you... This is what it means to be popular. Ahhh, the feeling is even more wonderful than I imagined!"
81,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_078","But ugh... In my glee, I didn't stop to consider how much work it will be. Looks like I'll be busy for a while..."
82,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_079","You're popular too, yes? Lots of people depend on you?"
83,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_080","Tell me, what is it like? Is it tough to have everyone needing something from you?"
84,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_081","Gah, I should've known it's not all milk and honey... But this is what I've dreamed of, and I promise to do my best to live up to it!"
