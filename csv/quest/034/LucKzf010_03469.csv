49,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_OLDERSISTERVIIS03469_000_001","She has been training to become a hunter, and today I sent her off into the woods alone for the first time. I wanted to believe she was ready... Yet I fear I have made a terrible mistake."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_OLDERSISTERVIIS03469_000_002","Even now I can hear her cries echo through the woods, but it is forbidden to assist hunters in their training."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_OLDERSISTERVIIS03469_000_003","You, however, are not bound by our laws. In fact, my sisters would likely see it as a mercy if you did."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_OLDERSISTERVIIS03469_000_004","It shames me to ask this of you, but could you bring her back to Fanow? She was last seen near Bowrest."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_OLDERSISTERVIIS03469_000_010","Please bring her home. She is not yet ready to hunt alone."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_YOUNGERSISTERVIIS03469_000_020","Ahhh! Stay away!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_SYSTEM_000_021","The terrified trainee runs off to the east. Best chase after her before she comes to harm."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_YOUNGERSISTERVIIS03469_000_030","...What? <gasp> You! Forgive me. In my panic I mistook you for one of the tarichuks."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_YOUNGERSISTERVIIS03469_000_031","More importantly, why are you here?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_YOUNGERSISTERVIIS03469_000_032","I see... <sigh> Sister will be disappointed to hear of this."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_YOUNGERSISTERVIIS03469_000_033","Would you accompany me? Perhaps she will be more forgiving in your presence."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZF010_03469_YOUNGERSISTERVIIS03469_000_035","I hope she will not be too angry with me."
