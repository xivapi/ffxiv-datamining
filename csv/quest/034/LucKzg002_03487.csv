50,"TEXT_LUCKZG002_03487_MHONMON_000_002","But it has become scarce around here, except for in an area that is plagued by evil weapons!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZG002_03487_MHONMON_000_003","Funny name, not so funny when they are trying to kill you, though! There is an especially horrible one called the wandering weapon who the others seem to follow."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZG002_03487_MHONMON_000_004","If you could get rid of it, the rest might leave us alone. Then I can finally harvest Amber weed in peace. So, will you help us?"

55,"TEXT_LUCKZG002_03487_MHONMON_000_021","But I wonder if the other evil weapons will come back... I hear they were made by the mages of Nabaath Areng from enchanted swords. Do not ask me how they ended up looking like that, though!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZG002_03487_MHONMON_000_022","Apparently, their masters disappeared after the Flood. With no one to command them, they have been prowling around Amber, attacking everything that comes close!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZG002_03487_MHONMON_000_023","I hope that by getting rid of the wandering weapon, they will stay away for a while, but who can say? All I know is, I can make my stew now! My stomach thanks you!"
