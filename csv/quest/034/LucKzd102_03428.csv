Tonatiuh wishes to send you back to Wolekdorf with his apologies."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_SEQ_01","While thankful that you came to find him, Tonatiuh does not wish to return with you to Wolekdorf, and asks that you convey his apologies to Sandman.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_SEQ_02","No sooner do you tell Sandman about Tonatiuh's decision than a panicked amaro arrives bearing word of trouble. It appears an amaro has devoured a porxie familiar, and its Nu Mou owner is none too pleased. The suspicion for the crime soon falls upon Tonatiuh, who is ignorant of the ways of Il Mheg. While Sandman has words with his own to make certain the culprit isn't among them, he bids you speak with the aggrieved Nu Mou for their account of the incident."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_SEQ_03","According to the aggrieved Nu Mou, their porxie was devoured while out gathering herbs. At your suggestion that the culprit was likely an amaro from outside Il Mheg, and not a creature of Wolekdorf, the Nu Mou demands you find and bring Tonatiuh to them for questioning. The young amaro is likely to still be close to the scene of the crime, somewhere in Voeburtenburg."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_SEQ_04","After a brief search, you manage to locate Tonatiuh, who blithely admits to having devoured the porxie. The revelation that what he consumed wasn't a wild animal, but a Nu Mou's cherished familiar, comes as a tremendous shock to the young amaro."

61,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_SANDMAN_000_030","This is true. Tonatiuh has but arrived here. He knows not the ways of Il Mheg."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_SANDMAN_000_035","Aye. If an amaro committed the deed, it must be one who knows not the ways of Il Mheg. One such as Tonatiuh, who has but recently arrived here."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_SANDMAN_000_040","While I would not blame him out of hand, the possibility cannot be ignored. Forgive me, my friend, but will you not help us once more?"

68,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_ANGRYNUMOU03428_000_061","My porxie was out gathering herbs when it happened. Suddenly, I sensed its intense fear. It then cried to me in my mind that an amaro was chasing it. And then it was gone."

72,"TEXT_LUCKZD102_03428_ANGRYNUMOU03428_000_064","Prove it. Bring me this amaro that's responsible, this Tonatiuh, and let us have the truth from him. If he is ignorant as you say, he should still be near the scene of the crime, in Voeburtenburg."

...Hm? Have I seen a porxie, you ask?"
