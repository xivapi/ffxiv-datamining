Lanille furrows her brow with a look of both concern and exasperation."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_01","Phyna and Ciuna are to petition the spirits once more, and Lanille has again designated you as witness to the ritual. Before it can take place, however, they must assemble a new set of offerings. The twins take their leave to begin preparations, and once out of earshot, Lanille makes another request of you. To speak with them, and convince them to divulge to you their troubles. She suggests beginning with Ciuna, hoping that Phyna will be willing to talk once her sister opens up to you."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_02","Ciuna begrudgingly accepts your help, asking you to hunt three blue stags for their meat."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_03","Finding the blue stags was relatively easy, as was felling them for their meat. Perhaps you will receive some modicum of thanks for your assistance."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_04","You deliver the stag meat to Ciuna, whose response is less than enthusiastic. She begins to tell you of her concerns about protecting Fanow, but quickly thinks better of it, instead asking you to go check on her sister."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_05","You find Phyna picking through bushes and she is relieved to have a helping hand. She bids you search for mushrooms to add to their growing collection of offerings."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_06","Narrowly dodging the dangers of the Greatwood, you manage to procure three succulent-looking mushrooms. Phyna is certain to be pleased."
7,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_07","With mushrooms in hand, Phyna appears to be finished gathering her share for the ritual. She thanks you for your help, which somehow leads to her divulging her plans for the future: to leave the village in an attempt to find other Viis willing to return home and help sustain Fanow. Her candid conversation is cut short when a shrill cry pierces the air. Without a second's hesitation she runs off to its source."
8,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_08","You find Phyna protecting a wounded Ciuna from a pair of gizamaluks. The beasts are summarily routed, but it still remains to be seen if Ciuna is all right."
9,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_09","Despite her injuries, Ciuna insists on continuing her hunt, but the thought of her coming to further harm is too much for Phyna. She apologizes to Ciuna for being insensitive and receives an apology in turn. Phyna then seizes the opportunity to explain her intent in wanting to leave the village. Ciuna is taken aback by her selflessness, and pledges to make Fanow a welcoming place for any and all Viis who might heed Phyna's request to return. The two then return home, a great weight lifted from their shoulders."
10,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_SEQ_10","Lanille is surprised but relieved to see the rift between Ciuna and Phyna mended. It would seem everything is ready for their petition to the gods. "

51,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_002","But before there can be another ceremony, a new set of offerings must be made ready─an oblation of meats and fruits favored by the gods. Might I ask you to help with their preparations?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_003","Very good. The three of you together should finish in no time at all."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_004","When you have gathered what is required, you are to report back to me at once."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_005","I will go ahead and begin searching for fruits."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_006","<sigh> I suppose I will hunt for meat... Though it would be faster to handle this all myself."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_007","I never realized she had grown so cold."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_008","She has always been quite prideful, and committed to protecting our traditions. I understand her reservations about permitting outsiders into our woods, but to be so unwelcoming even to allies of Ronka for whom we have waited all these years... It concerns me greatly."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_009","Meanwhile, Phyna seems more than willing to be the perfect host. But now I wonder if her enthusiasm is genuine."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_010","With what you have learned from the others, perhaps now you can get through to Phyna and Ciuna. Convince them to speak of their troubles."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_011","Ciuna is by far the most stubborn of the two. Reach her with your words, and Phyna too will open up to you before long. "
61,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_015","Please, do what you can for them. Family should never quarrel as they do."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_020","Again she chooses you as witness... Well, let us get this over with."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_021","We require the meat of blue stags for the offering. Three stags should supply us with enough, I think. If you can handle that, I will gather the rest."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_022","I am not here to make small talk. Bring me the blue stag meat, and I will handle the rest."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_040","Well?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_041","Hmph, not bad. Perhaps you <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> worthy of the others' praise."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_042","You were not quite as fast as my bow. Though after all of my training, I would be surprised if you were."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_043","All that training... To provide for Fanow, and protect the ruins."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_044","Growing up, I believed we would always be able to defend these woods on our own. But now..."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_045","Ahem. Never mind. Would you go and check on Phyna? I will see if there is aught else worth hunting."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_050","There you are. I take it Ciuna's turned you away?"
72,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_051","Well, you are more than welcome here. I am having trouble finding suitable mushrooms for the offering. If you could bring me three, I would be forever grateful."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_052","Do make sure the mushrooms you pick are fully mature. The gods will be offended if our choice of offerings is poor."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_070","Were you able to find anything promising?"
75,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_071","Yes, these will do nicely. Thank you."
76,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_072","Never in my wildest dreams did I think I could work alongside one from outside the Greatwood."
77,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_073","Yet here you are. And now I cannot help but wonder... What if the future of Fanow lies beyond our borders?"
78,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_074","The captain of your Crystarium is Viis, yes? Those who leave our village are never to return, but she is proof they may yet go on to do great things."
79,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_075","We could reach out to them, allow them to go freely between here and their new homes, perhaps even establish new settlements. The Viis would thrive, and the future of Fanow would be secure."
80,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_076","That is how I wish to honor our duty to His Eminence─by finding our sisters who left the Greatwood."
81,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_077","But that also means leaving behind Ciuna... Oh, how I wish she would understand."
82,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_078","I think it is time I talked with her."

84,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_080","Ciuna! She's in trouble!"
85,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_100","She will be fine. Thank the gods."
86,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_101","You... Of course it would be you. And now the beasts are gone. No matter... I will find another."
87,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_102","Ciuna, no! This is all my fault... "
88,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_103","When <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> comrades first arrived in Fanow, I was elated. Everyone was. It was a chance to learn about the world beyond the Greatwood."
89,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_104","But I never stopped to consider your feelings. What you might think if I...if I..."
90,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_105","If you left Fanow? I have always known of your desire to see the outside world. I have only myself to blame for not voicing my concerns."
91,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_106","Times have changed. And with your arrival, the greatest of our duties to the late emperor has been fulfilled. The ruins still require our protection, but perhaps we can find another way. One that does not require we sacrifice our freedom."
92,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_107","It would be selfish of me to deny you your dreams for the sake of tradition. You would not be the first, nor the last, to leave Fanow."
93,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_108","No matter where you go, we will always be family."
94,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_109","Oh, Ciuna..."
95,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_Q1_000_020","What will you say?"
96,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_A1_000_021","We're not your only allies outside Fanow."
97,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_A1_000_022","She has no intention of abandoning Fanow when she leaves."
98,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_110","What does <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> mean by this, Sister?"
99,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_111","You are incredibly talented, and you will make a fine member of the guard someday."
100,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_112","But we are not all suited for such duty, and those that are grow fewer and fewer. We need help, Sister. The Viis who now lead lives beyond the Greatwood."
101,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_113","And you would find them for us..."
102,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_114","Then I would make of Fanow a village that welcomes them home with open arms."
103,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_115","It is a chance to prosper as we once did before the Flood, to ensure we carry on the legacy of our forebears. We must seize it, Sister. Together."
104,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_116","I...I know not what to say."
105,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_117","A word of thanks, perhaps, to our friend here. If not for <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>, we would still be at odds. "
106,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_118","Why, you almost sound sincere, Sister."
107,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_119","If you are done with your jokes, we should be heading back. Lanille will be worried."
108,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_125","I feel embarrassed to think of how I treated you before."
109,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_126","It is good to see Ciuna smiling again."
110,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_130","Now that you have the offering, it is time we talked."
111,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_131","No need, Master Lanille. Phyna and I are fine. Better than fine."
112,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_CIUNA_000_132","Change has come quickly to Fanow, and we allowed it to divide us when we should have embraced it together. We have learned from our mistake and come to understand that, though we walk different paths, our goal is the same. That is all that matters in the end."
113,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_LANILLE_000_133","Well, it is certainly good to see you two are back to your old selves."
114,"TEXT_LUCKZF103_03480_PHYNA_000_134","Well, we did have a little help."
