56,"TEXT_LUCKZG007_03492_MINERB03492_000_031","And I don't know why he bothers making us work in shifts. “Everyone needs to take turns,” he says. Pah! There's hardly anybody left! Most of the others have gone to seek their fortune elsewhere."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZG007_03492_MINERB03492_000_032","Besides us, there are only a handful of miners left in Twine. On the bright side, that means there's more for me to dig up. I guess I can afford to stop for a bite to eat, though."

60,"TEXT_LUCKZG007_03492_MINERC03492_000_042","Of course, we used to dig up a lot more back then, too. <sigh> At this rate, I'll have to consider taking up another profession..."
