57,"TEXT_LUCKZG011_03496_A1_000_002","That's the first I've heard of it, but it shouldn't be a problem."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZG011_03496_MERCHANT03496_000_030","Had your master not given you the correct instructions? Oh my, this is highly irregular. You seem the dependable sort, though. I'm sure you're more than capable of performing such a task if you put your mind to it."

61,"TEXT_LUCKZG011_03496_MERCHANT03496_000_060","Unfortunately, avoiding debitages comes part and parcel with trading in Amh Araeng. Fighting them, on the other hand, is best left to the professionals, like yourself."

73,"TEXT_LUCKZG011_03496_MINER03496_000_111","Well, it's not like I paid anything for it. If this is all I get by way of comeuppance, I haven't done too badly."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZG011_03496_MINER03496_000_120","I do feel a tiny bit guilty about making you risk your life fighting angry rock giants. A tiny bit."
75,"TEXT_LUCKZG011_03496_MINER03496_000_121","You can hardly blame a man for finding his own entertainment, though. There's not much to do around here, as you can see. But you've given me a few laughs, that's for sure!"
