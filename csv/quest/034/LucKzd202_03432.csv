It belonged to my master, a knight of Voeburt, and it points to a piece of evidence in a matter that he was investigating."
49,"TEXT_LUCKZD202_03432_THONAN_000_002","Alas, my master is long dead, and the place indicated upon the map lies drowned beneath Longmirror Lake. We amaro are not made for the water and I am unable to reach this place. If you consider yourself a strong swimmer, will you not search in my stead?"

55,"TEXT_LUCKZD202_03432_THONAN_000_023","This is a letter, bearing the symbol of Voeburt's royal mages and addressed to a noble house. A house aligned with the faction that sought to usurp the crown..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZD202_03432_THONAN_000_024","It seems that the mages were in league with the insurgents. Had my master seen this, he would have stopped at nothing to bring them all to justice."
