49,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_001","Several days ago we sighted a young girl wandering the wood. We loosed warning arrows, and she fled back whence she came. However, she dropped these earrings in her haste."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_002","I bear no ill will toward her, so I would like to return them, but I cannot leave. If it is not too much trouble, could you bring them to their owner?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_003","As a sign of apology, I would like to affix a Ronkan lilybell to the earrings. They can be found growing in the woods of Yx'Maja. When you are done, please make your way to Slitherbough and find her. I believe she wore her hair in pigtails."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_004","I apologize for requesting such a menial task from you, but as you know I have little recourse. I simply wish to put her heart at ease."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_010","When you have affixed the earrings with the lilybell, please bring them to the young lady in Slitherbough. I pray this sets her heart at ease."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLA03465_000_020","What's this? Earrings? They aren't mine, although they are pretty. If it was a necklace I might've been tempted to lie, tee hee."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLB03465_000_021","Earrings? Mine have been firmly attached to my ears as far as I know. A friend of mine was lamenting over something she had lost, however..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLC03465_000_022","Hmm? A pair of earrings? It just so happens I lost my own while in the woods some time ago..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLC03465_000_023","You didn't! You found them! And the lilybell is a masterful touch!"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLC03465_000_024","That Viis asked you to do this? I...I suppose she didn't mean me harm after all..."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLC03465_000_025","It is as Master Matoya said. They uphold their duty as the wood's protectors with grave severity. They only reacted as they should have."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLC03465_000_026","Please, give this ring to the one who sent you. Tell her I apologize for my rudeness, and will be more careful when next I go into the woods."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLC03465_000_030","Please give my ring to the Viis by way of apology. It's the least I can give after I encroached upon their sacred space."

63,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_041","I see. She is kind as well as wise. I shall hang this ring from my neck as a keepsake, to remind me of her. You have my gratitude for everything you have done."
