Methuli Cattlan is bristling with anger.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 3 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA204_01507_SEQ_01","Methuli Cattlan has asked you to craft for her a high-quality engine casing component for the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. As is all too often the case, however, you must first acquire the materials before you can proceed. In this instance, the carrier charged with delivering the materials has yet to arrive, and Methuli Cattlan suspects he has lost his way somewhere near the Spriggan Dig. Search for the Ehcatl Nine carrier in the Central Shroud and, with the chat mode in <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Say<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, enter the password “High as Honor” to identify yourself as a friend.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Detailing<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Hildeyerd."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA204_01507_SEQ_04","You deliver the engine casing component to Methuli Cattlan, whose contempt for the carrier has yet to abate. She goes so far as to name you a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>queen<Else/>king</If> amongst your kind─flattery doubtless intended to make you more amenable to future requests."
