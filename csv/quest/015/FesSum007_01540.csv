※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM007_01540_SEQ_01","Ever the quizzer, Ethelia is nevertheless deadly earnest about the import of this fire–fighting exhibition. If you would mount an elbst, find a Moonfire marine east of the Blind Iron Mines.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM007_01540_SEQ_02","Someone once said that one can see more clearly while astride an elbst. Whether or not that's so, it would be hard to miss the fires burning merrily in three designated spots in Cedarwood. Go forth, elbst rider, and Saturate the flames with water, cold and clear."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM007_01540_SEQ_03","Thrice you have spurred the elbst to spew forth its watery ballast, and thrice have you seen a pillar of fire crumble to sodden cinders. The chaperone Ethelia would no doubt like to hear of this, as well as disconcert you again with her quizzing ways."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM007_01540_SEQ_04","All's well that ends wet, according to Ethelia─at least when it comes to an event billed as a Rousing Douse. Your time on an elbst was all too brief, but fortunately, a return engagement with the Moonfire Marines is on offer, should you decide to accept."

63,"TEXT_FESSUM007_01540_ETHELIA_000_033","Speaking of giving credit, Haermaga's the one who started in on the “do it for the children” bit. He goes about pretending it was someone else's idea, but he's not fooling me. Families have turned out for the faire in droves thanks to him."

65,"TEXT_FESSUM007_01540_ETHELIA_000_035","Anyway, I'd better give you your reward─you've certainly earned it! You're welcome back among the Moonfire Marines any time. The audience would love a return performance, I'm sure."
