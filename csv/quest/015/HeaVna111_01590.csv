1,"TEXT_HEAVNA111_01590_SEQ_01","Emmanellain de Fortemps, second son of Count Edmont de Fortemps, has long dreamed of emerging from beneath his elder brother's shadow. Though he had always intended to use his mission to aid House Haillenarte to further this aim, he had not counted on having the famed Warrior of Light to assist him. Eager to take advantage of his good fortune, he makes haste for the airship landing and bids you follow."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNA111_01590_SEQ_04","After making mock of your loquacious nature, Lord Emmanellain bids you seek out and speak with Lady Laniaitte, the garrison commander in Camp Cloudtop."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA111_01590_SEQ_05","After treating you to an unexpectedly warm welcome, Lady Laniaitte explains that she is the elder sister of Lord Francel, whose unjust execution you prevented during your search for the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> long ago. Her gladness at your presence does not extend to Lord Emmanellain, however, though the young lord seems oblivious to her low opinion of him."
