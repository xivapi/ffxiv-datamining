A wise Ixal knows well the value of auxiliary systems, and Jezul Ahuatan the Second is no exception.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 49 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA606_01567_SEQ_01","Jezul Ahuatan will not declare the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> finished until an auxiliary aerodynamo has been installed. Although their model is nearly complete, it lacks a key component─a component which can only be crafted with materials currently in the possession of the Ixal dwelling in Natalan. Though it be a dangerous task, you have no choice but to infiltrate the stronghold and steal the materials.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA606_01567_SEQ_02","The auxiliary aerodynamo component materials are now yours. Present them to Norbettaux at Camp Dragonhead in order to gain access to the crafting facility under his care."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA606_01567_SEQ_03","Norbettaux has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize a high-quality auxiliary aerodynamo component, and deliver it to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Finishing II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA606_01567_SEQ_04","Within Jezul Ahuatan beats the heart of an idealist. To him, no risk is too great and no benefit is too small, should it serve to further his people's goals. Should you share his feelings, he would no doubt be grateful─and all the more willing─to entrust you with more dangerous tasks."
