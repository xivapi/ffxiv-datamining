※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM004_01537_SEQ_01","Haermaga believes you would make a great addition to a fire–fighting event called the Rousing Douse. What exactly makes it so rousing, he would not say. You will find the answer at the Blind Iron Mines from a chaperone called Ethelia.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM004_01537_SEQ_02","Ethelia is rather more cavalier than you expected of a chaperone, but it is surely a sign of her confidence in your ability to handle a large, ill-tempered monster traditionally in the employ of your sworn enemies. The clamor of the children grows louder; give your assent to Ethelia, mount the elbst, and commence the waterworks."
