1,"TEXT_COMLIM003_01564_SEQ_01","According to Lieutenant Trachraet, the Eorzean Alliance has instituted a bounty system referred to as the Hunt. For the piquant particulars of this most challenging venture, seek out the Hunt billmaster within Maelstrom Command."

Though all the talk of pudding and death is discomfiting, it is good to know someone you can turn to for information─or to spend your hard-earned Allied Seals. Do your part to preserve the peace, and you will be richly rewarded."
