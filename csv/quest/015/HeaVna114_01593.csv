1,"TEXT_HEAVNA114_01593_SEQ_01","The men and women of Camp Cloudtop have grown complacent, Ser Marielle says, as the camp has developed a reputation as a backwater of no significance in the war with Dravania. The knight cannot abide this state of affairs, and has asked you to stoke the fighting spirits of her sentries─/psych them up, in her own words."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA114_01593_SEQ_02","Your wild gesticulations elicit a variety of responses from the sentries, one of whom is Lord Emmanellain. Ser Marielle will doubtless find the young lord's reaction the most interesting of all."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA114_01593_SEQ_03","According to Ser Marielle, there has been a noticeable change in the sentries' behavior, which she ascribes to your efforts. But when you tell her of Lord Emmanellain's sudden desire for more demanding work, she can only chuckle nervously at the thought of what is to come."
