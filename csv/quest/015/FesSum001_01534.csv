0,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_SEQ_00","Event organizing is a cruel mistress, and one chaperone of the Moonfire Faire is determined that you should feel its heartless lash.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_SEQ_01","According to a roving chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, the Adventurers' Guild is looking for members willing to help with the festivities. As a proud <If(PlayerParameter(4))>guildswoman<Else/>guildsman</If> and something of a sartorial adventurer, it would behoove you to slip on a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>red lady's yukata<Else/>blue lord's yukata</If> and take yourself to the Aftcastle. If the chief chaperone, Haermaga, is all that he is promised to be, this transaction would prove to be in your favor.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_SEQ_02","Haermaga is a trifle vague on the rationale of these festivities, but quite clear on the matter of reward. In return for participating in three events, you will receive prizes, plus a special costume. Your summer wardrobe is a little lacking, and it would be well for the commonfolk to see what an adventurer is made of. And if that should prove insufficient motivation, do it for the children."

49,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_EXABU01534_000_001","In case you're unfamiliar with the festival, it was first held five years ago in order to extinguish the Bombards─fiery fiends who threatened to turn the whole realm into a living inferno. Now, the creatures haven't <Emphasis>actually</Emphasis> made a return this year, but that doesn't mean we can't have a scorching good time!"
50,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_EXABU01534_000_002","In the absence of a real threat, we're focusing instead on making the commonfolk's love of the faire work for <Emphasis>us</Emphasis>, the rank-and-file adventurers!

51,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_EXABU01534_000_003","So how about it, my innocent <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>? Help your guild, help yourself? Go to the Aftcastle of Limsa Lominsa, then! There lumbers Haermaga, the grand chaperone of Moonfire Faire."

53,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_EXABU01534_000_005","If you've no yukata of your own, procure one at a Moonfire Faire vendor. Oh, quibble not─'tis but a small expense, and you'll receive a new set of raiments for assisting with the festivities."

55,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_EXABU01534_000_011","The yukata can be purchased from any Moonfire Faire vendor. And no, we'll not defray the expense! It's quite piddling as it is. Besides, the guild's coffers are for more pressing needs."
56,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_HAERMAGA_000_020","So! You're here to muck in and churn it up for the Moonfire Faire? That's the spirit─the adventuring spirit! Come to think of it, that's what the festivities are about, isn't it?"

Where would the guild be without the next generation? Getting old, that's where we'd be. Don't know about you, but I'm not spending my golden years crafting ingots!"
60,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_HAERMAGA_000_024","So we figured─or one of the other chaperones figured, I don't go to all the meetings─there should be three adventuring events. There's a prize for each one, and we'd be extra appreciative if you do all three!"

63,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_HAERMAGA_000_031","But I'm a helpful sort of fellow. I'm the chief chaperone here, after all! You can buy a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>red lady's yukata<Else/>blue lord's yukata</If> from any Moonfire Faire vendor. Then you'll be ready to muck in and do your bit for the guild!"
