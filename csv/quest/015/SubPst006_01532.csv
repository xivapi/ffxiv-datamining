When life hands you a lemon, make lemoncakes─deliver the missive to Gegeruju's beach paradise in eastern La Noscea, and try to enjoy the journey."
2,"TEXT_SUBPST006_01532_SEQ_02","The envelope you delivered contains a blunt refusal from the dancing master Guillaunaux, who Master Gegeruju had sought to employ for the purpose of bringing the forefront of artistic expression to Costa del Sol. Fortunately for the enterprising entrepreneur, Guillaunaux saw fit to introduce another dance instructor who may prove more accommodating. Carry the contract drafted by Gegeruju to this esteemed personage, who may be found in outer La Noscea."
3,"TEXT_SUBPST006_01532_SEQ_03","The mysterious dance instructor is revealed to be none other than Bugaal Ja, a Mamool Ja whose questionable behavior while bathing has earned him the scorn and disgust of many a smoothskin. Deeply moved to have found a patron who would pay the proper respect to his people's tradition, Bugaal Ja eagerly consents to the terms offered. Before setting off for Costa del Sol, however, he must prepare himself according to Mamool Ja custom. Seek him out at the Hermit's Hovel."
4,"TEXT_SUBPST006_01532_SEQ_04","Bugaal Ja is eager to make for Costa del Sol and begin his dance instruction, but first he must purify his body according to Mamool Ja ritual─or rather, you must do it for him. Pour some sacred spring water over the Mamool Ja's body."

9,"TEXT_SUBPST006_01532_SEQ_09","Bugaal Ja's undulations and gyrations proved a bit too vigorous for the aspiring dancers, who fled screaming from the lesson while it had barely begun. Speak with Master Gegeruju and hear his assessment of the entire ordeal."
10,"TEXT_SUBPST006_01532_SEQ_10","While disheartened with the results, Master Gegeruju does not regret his endeavor to bring the vanguard of artistic expression to Costa del Sol. Nevertheless, it appears that it will still be some time before the average Eorzean can find it in himself to accept Mamool Ja custom. In the meantime, should the undulations of the erstwhile dancing master once more threaten to cause panic amongst the unwitting bath-goers of Bronze Lake, you know where your talents will be needed."
