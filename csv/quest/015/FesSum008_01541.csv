0,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_00","Moonfire Faire chaperone Mayaru Moyaru is on alert for your call, for not many adventurers have the Cannon–do Spirit.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_01","Mayaru Moyaru is quite the demon whisperer; confined within the event venue are womandragoras and sabotenders both. Use any of the 18-ponze cannons at your disposal to batter the former twice and the latter once.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_02","All targets are moving targets when there are cannons and crowds involved. Despite the difficulties, you have triumphed. Mayaru Moyaru will be relieved to hear how well and precisely you comported yourself."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_03","Mayaru Moyaru is delighted that this family-friendly event concluded without any bystander injuries. How wonderful it is to see the smiles of the children, and watch them run after the cannonballs. Some actions cannot be undone, but you may always return to the Cannon–do Spirit."

49,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_MAYARUMOYARU_000_001","Very fleet of foot, those sabotenders. Aim well─stray cannonballs are <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> appropriate for family events! And don't be shy─you can try the event as many times as you like. Do tell me when you've succeeded, however."

55,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_MAYARUMOYARU_000_031","It's always one thing after another in this line of work. Chaperoning an event, I mean. Regular adventuring is quite tame in comparison."
56,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_MAYARUMOYARU_000_032","Why, I've had to tend to everything myself. Stronger leadership certainly wouldn't have been amiss, but we simply couldn't agree on whom to elect the chief chaperone.
