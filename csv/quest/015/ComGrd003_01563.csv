50,"TEXT_COMGRD003_01563_SCARLET_000_002","The Alliance makes much of this joining of sword hands, while allowing rivalries to go unchecked elsewhere. Small wonder that some see a bent branch where we claim a bough true and proud."

These people are veterans of the Hunt who can recite the Raimdelle Codex by heart."
