Tazel Meyean the Lettered has a mind to test his latest brainchild.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 10 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 47 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA403_01500_SEQ_01","Tazel Meyean has asked you to craft for him a high-quality starboard wing control component, that he might test the revolutionary mechanism he has conceived. The requisite materials can be obtained from treasure pots found within the Ixali logging grounds.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA403_01500_SEQ_02","You have obtained several sets of starboard wing control component materials. Present them to Hildeyerd at the Bobbing Cork in order to gain access to the crafting facility under her care."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA403_01500_SEQ_03","Hildeyerd has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize a high-quality starboard wing control component, and deliver it to Tazel Meyean at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Detailing<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Hildeyerd."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA403_01500_SEQ_04","You have delivered the starboard wing control component to Tazel Meyean, who squawks in sheer delight. The Ixal is most impressed by your ability to craft precisely to specification, and will doubtless request your services again as he conceives exciting new ideas."
