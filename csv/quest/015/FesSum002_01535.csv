0,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_SEQ_00","An adventurer without a guild is no adventurer at all, and one chaperone of the Moonfire Faire is determined that you should do your part.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_SEQ_01","According to a roving chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, the Adventurers' Guild is looking for members willing to help with the festivities. As a proud <If(PlayerParameter(4))>guildswoman<Else/>guildsman</If> and something of a sartorial adventurer, it would behoove you to slip on a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>red lady's yukata<Else/>blue lord's yukata</If> and take yourself to the Aftcastle. If the chief chaperone, Haermaga, is all that he is promised to be, this transaction would prove to be in your favor.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_SEQ_02","Haermaga is a trifle vague on the rationale of these festivities, but quite clear on the matter of reward. In return for participating in three events, you will receive prizes, plus a special costume. Your summer wardrobe is a little lacking, and it would be well for the commonfolk to see what an adventurer is made of. And if that should prove insufficient motivation, do it for the children."

49,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_EXABU01535_000_001","Have you heard of the faire? It has its origins in the Bombard hunts we started five years ago. Fire, dancing, incineration─what's not to love?"

51,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_EXABU01535_000_003","Are you with me? You're with me! Well, go on up to that big lummox over there. That's Chief Chaperone Haermaga."

53,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_EXABU01535_000_005","Don't have one of those? Well, worry not! I bought mine from one of the Moonfire Faire vendors for a modest enough sum. You'll also get a new set of garb later for helping."
54,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_EXABU01535_000_010","If you want to help with the Moonfire Faire, go talk to Chief Chaperone Haermaga right over there. Don't forget to wear your <If(PlayerParameter(4))>red lady's yukata<Else/>blue lord's yukata</If> so he knows what you're about."
55,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_EXABU01535_000_011","You can buy a yukata from any Moonfire Faire vendor. It won't set you back very much, so don't be such a gil–pincher!"
56,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_HAERMAGA_000_020","So! You're here to muck in and churn it up for the Moonfire Faire? That's the spirit─the adventuring spirit! Come to think of it, that's what the festivities are about, isn't it?"
57,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_HAERMAGA_000_021","The adventuring trade has a─hang my tongue─has a <Emphasis>figuring</Emphasis> problem, see? The commonfolk can't figure out what we do, beyond doing that hither, doing this thither."
58,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_HAERMAGA_000_022","What we need's a real adventurer living by the sweat of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> brow, showing everyone how it's done! And what we do! You know, mucking in, living it up! Making it real!"

Where would the guild be without the next generation? Getting old, that's where we'd be. Don't know about you, but I'm not spending my golden years crafting ingots!"
60,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_HAERMAGA_000_024","So we figured─or one of the other chaperones figured, I don't go to all the meetings─there should be three adventuring events. There's a prize for each one, and we'd be extra appreciative if you do all three!"
61,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_HAERMAGA_000_025","So, ah, you ready to do this? If you are, I'll show you where you can find the events!"

63,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_HAERMAGA_000_031","But I'm a helpful sort of fellow. I'm the chief chaperone here, after all!
