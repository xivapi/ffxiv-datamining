2,"TEXT_HEAVNA106_01585_SEQ_02","Thierremont has been tasked with the restoration of the sculpture, for which the dark bristles of deepeyes would be most useful. Slay three of the beasts and shear their bristles for the mason."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNA106_01585_SEQ_04","More than a mere statue of Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon, the Pike is a proud symbol of Ishgardian defiance. Though the work may be hard and the conditions harsh, Thierremont could ask for no greater honor than to tend the monument."
