A crafter makes and a warrior unmakes. What then is an adventurer, who does both and more?
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 49 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA605_01566_SEQ_01","Jezul Ahuatan wonders if you might be able to craft some hyperconductor components. You must begin by collecting an unusual material. In the Ogre's Belly in the Coerthas highlands, there are many fell things─among them a swarm of will-o'-the-wykes. Slaying one will draw the ire of St. Daniffen's fire, from the vanquished husk of which you can obtain a sample of semi-stable ectoplasm.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA605_01566_SEQ_02","The ectoplasm pulses with hypnotic energy, but you have better things to do than stare slack-jawed into the light. Present the ectoplasm to Norbettaux at Camp Dragonhead, and ask him to grant you access to the crafting facility."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA605_01566_SEQ_03","Norbettaux has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize two high-quality hyperconductor components, and deliver them to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Detailing II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA605_01566_SEQ_04","Jezul Ahuatan pronounces the hyperconductor components more than satisfactory, and pays you the compliment of speaking to you as kindred. Though you have never been and never will be the Second of Ehcatl, you understand of what he speaks─that a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman's<Else/>man's</If> work is more than the sum of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> jobs."
