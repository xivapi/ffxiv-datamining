Unfortunately, the materials required in their synthesis have been stolen in transit by the Ixal who dwell in the logging grounds. Make your way to Alder Springs, and retrieve the materials from the storage pot in which they are kept.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

Having heaped praise upon your craftsmanship, she goes on to express her disdain for her brethren who blindly worship Garuda. It would seem that birds of a feather do not necessarily flock together."
