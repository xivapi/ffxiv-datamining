Rozol Cattlan the Prudent requests the aid of a skilled Disciple of the Hand.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 6 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA301_01514_SEQ_01","Rozol Cattlan the Prudent has asked for your assistance in the crafting of high-quality components for the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>'s cockpit exterior. However, before you can gain access to the facilities necessary for the synthesis, you must first find a way to bribe the young Highwind Skyways representative in charge of overseeing the equipment. Rozol believes you may be able to achieve this with a saint carp─a rare type of fish living in the frigid waters of the Coerthas River to the west of the Observatorium. It is said that saint carp are best caught with moth pupae.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA301_01514_SEQ_02","You have caught a saint carp. Now hurry the fish to Templeton at the Observatorium while it is still fresh, and convince the corrupt lad to grant you use of the crafting facilities. It may also be wise to allow him to inspect the materials entrusted to you by Rozol, so as not to arouse suspicion amongst his ever-watching superiors."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA301_01514_SEQ_03","Templeton is every bit as unscrupulous as advertised, and now you have full access to the Highwind Skyways temporary crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by Rozol and inspected by Templeton to synthesize two high-quality cockpit exterior components, and deliver the finished products to Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Production II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Templeton."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA301_01514_SEQ_04","You have delivered the cockpit exterior components to Rozol Cattlan the Prudent and, as much as it pains him to do so, he begins to see why Chief Sezul Totoloc has elected to place his trust in a “featherless neuker.” As for the crooked Skyways representative─it might be best that, for now, his supervisors remain unaware of your mutually beneficial relationship with the young man."
