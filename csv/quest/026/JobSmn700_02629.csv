1,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SEQ_01","Y'mhitra tells you what she has learned in preparation for your journey to the research facility on Azys Lla, and informs you that Captain Wolf and his summoner squad will be providing military support. Make ready for the expedition, then rendezvous with your companions at Helix."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SEQ_02","You join Y'mhitra and the others on Azys Lla, and the scholar urges you to begin the search for a control panel of some kind. Head towards your assigned area near the statues of the Warring Triad, and seek out a research facility terminal."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SEQ_03","You approach a promising control panel only to find yourself set upon by a trio of clockwork soldiers. After defeating your ambushers, you once more stretch forth a hand to operate the terminal..."
4,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SEQ_04","Your efforts at the terminal are rewarded by the appearance of Sari, who then proceeds to lay his challenge at your feet. Your companions arrive in time to witness the exchange, and Y'mhitra suggests that the “clone” is, in fact, some manner of summoned entity. Her observation seems supported by the evidence at hand, but gives rise to yet another question: who, then, is the summoner? Prepare yourself to face the formidable egi, then speak with Captain Wolf when you are ready to enter the facility."
5,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SEQ_05","After a shocking revelation, you discover that the strings of the Sari-egi were being pulled by a sentient machine─an invention of Sari's which describes itself as an “evocation matrix.” All attempts to reason with the warped intelligence fail, and you and your companions are drawn into a battle of surreal proportions. Despite the bewildering capabilities of your opponent, however, you seize victory over the mechanical summoner. Join Y'mhitra by the statues of the Warring Triad, and discuss the aftermath of the battle."
6,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SEQ_06","With the evocation matrix destroyed, you have removed the final barrier to learning the secrets held within Principia's pages. Say your farewells to the summoning squad, and return to Gridania with Y'mhitra."
7,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SEQ_07","Upon your return, Captain Wolf shares the results of his last-moment investigation. He reports that he salvaged a number of soul crystals from the wreckage of the machine, as well as an accompanying record which explains the master summoner's descent into a bitter pessimism. You muse over Sari's disparate attempts to bequeath summoning to future generations, and the philosophical differences evident in the construction of Principia and the evocation matrix. The familiar itself seems satisfied to have entrusted you with its creator's knowledge, and content to leave the succession of summoning magic in your capable hands. Principia returns to its slumber, its purpose fulfilled...for now.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra once you have met the following requirements:
※ You must have registered a product key for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers to your service account.
※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”
※ You must have completed the role quest “A Tearful Reunion.”"

85,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_JAJASAMULALASAMU_000_195","We've got to find the master then. If we don't squash the summoner, the bastard'll just bring the Sari-egi back again an' again' an' again..."
86,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_PRINCIPIA_000_196","Whomever the “bastard” may be, he or she must be concealed somewhere nearby. An entity will always be summoned within a certain distance of the summoner─even machine-enhanced techniques cannot circumvent this basic principle."
87,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_PRINCIPIA_000_197","That our antagonist chose not to make an appearance on Seal Rock suggests a reluctance to expose oneself to direct harm. In this location, however, with so many computational devices near to hand, I expect the foe's art will be significantly bolstered."
88,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_DANCINGWOLF_000_198","So the egi will be even stronger than last time? All the more reason to take down this summoner quickly before we're swamped by aetherial horrors."
89,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_YMHITRA_000_199","Well, I've brought a little device that should help─an aetherometer I borrowed from my sister, Shtola. If I can detect the right currents, it should lead us straight to our hidden enemy."

98,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_PRINCIPIA_000_281","It is an aetherial entity, Captain Wolf, not a clone. And I must point out that your true objective is the summoner, rather than the servant."

107,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_PRINCIPIA_000_305","You are an egi in the form of my creator─an existence made possible through a fusion of summoning magic and aetherochemical technology."
108,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_PRINCIPIA_100_305","But while Master Sari was the last of the great summoners of Allag, you are naught more than an elaborate imitation. And you are no match for the summoner who now stands before you!"
109,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_SARI_000_306","Very good, but your conjecture has missed the mark. What I am is a defense mechanism that is capable of self-enhancement in order to combat ever greater threats."

111,"TEXT_JOBSMN700_02629_DANCINGWOLF_000_308","You mean to kill <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and make an egi of the Warrior of Light!?"
