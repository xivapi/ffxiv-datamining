49,"TEXT_STMBDZ002_02636_AHELISSA_000_001","It's not as haphazard as it may seem. Depending on the recipe, it doesn't really matter what sort you add, so long as you add something. I'll be here when you get back."

57,"TEXT_STMBDZ002_02636_AHELISSA_000_033","But to answer the question that's probably on your mind, yes. It's always like this. Never enough food or supplies to go around."
