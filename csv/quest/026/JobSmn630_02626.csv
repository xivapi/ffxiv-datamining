121,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_YMHITRA_000_571","From our research, we have learned that summoners were initially lauded as heroes for their success against the primals. When certain of these mages began to abuse the art's power for personal gain, however, the adoration of the populace shifted towards an oppressive hatred."
122,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_572","Correct. We speak now of the latter half of the Third Astral Era. My creator, Master Sari, was one of those who expended his energies on the destruction of primals, even as he fled from relentless persecution. Alongside his disciples, he triumphed over Belias and many other lesser entities."
123,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_YMHITRA_000_573","Belias? That was the name of the elder primal from whom Tristan once drew power...
Master Sari must have been mighty indeed to defeat such a foe."
124,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_574","Yet he still knew fear: the thought that the grand discipline of summoning would fade into oblivion was more than Master Sari could bear. And so he sought to preserve its legacy, and provide for his successors."
125,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_575","My creator was well versed in aetherochemistry and held a particular interest in the technology of information. Broadly speaking, he researched methods for producing arcane geometries without grimoires, and experimented with machine-enhanced egi."
126,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_576","He eventually abandoned both of these technologies, deeming them unsuitable for the instruction of future generations.

127,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_YMHITRA_000_577","Such an accomplished personage...
Why, then, have I seen but scant mention of his name in Allag's histories?"
128,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_578","As you have said yourself, it was an age when the adulation of summoners experienced an extreme reversal. It is likely that Master Sari's achievements were struck from the records, even as his loyal pupils were struck down in the streets."
129,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_579","I was shut in a storeroom─abandoned to my slumber like some common treatise on trade agreements in the southern provinces─and thus I can tell you naught of what befell my creator in his later years."
