51,"TEXT_STMBDZ006_02640_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_003","The morbol was spotted to the east of here near Pike Falls, but they're certain to have fled. Nevertheless, I would ask you start your search there."

61,"TEXT_STMBDZ006_02640_SOLDIERB02640_100_032","We're well enough to make it back to Castrum Oriens on our own. You must see to the morbol before anyone else comes to harm."
