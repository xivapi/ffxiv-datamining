1,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_01","Atelloune is quite pleased with reactions to the dhalmel mount you and Enion constructed. The lack of inquiries regarding its distinct characteristics, however, has left her puzzled. Yet there is no time for quandaries, for she has decided on your next specimen─the ferocious grizzly bear of Gyr Abania. They are indigenous to East End, and she insists you speak with the soldiers of Castrum Oriens to better locate their den."
2,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_02","You arrive to find Enion is eager to get started. He suggests splitting up to gather information on grizzly bears, and immediately dashes off in search of soldiers to interrogate."
3,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_03","You speak with a Gridanian soldier who suggests you search near Bittermill. With this information in hand, you look for Enion to see if he has learned anything of your quarry. "
4,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_04","No sooner do you mention Bittermill than Enion rushes off in search of a grizzly bear. You hurry after him to assist in the hunt."
5,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_05","Enion is exhausted having narrowly escaped creatures that now call Bittermill their home. While he was fleeing, however, he tells you he spotted a grizzly bear near the river. Now eager to find a specimen fit for mounting, he rushes off once more into the woods."
6,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_06","You find Enion near the riverbank, a deceased grizzly bear at his feet. Its pelt is a ruin of cuts and grazes. Considering the scarcity of this woodland creature, Enion resigns to skinning it in the hopes of finding some use for its skin. You hope Atelloune will not be upset over its poor condition."
7,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_07","Though saddened by the state of the bear's pelt, Atelloune does not fault you for doing what you could to salvage it. She is convinced there is nothing to be done, but you insist that the pelt should not be wasted. She then entrusts it to you, and suggests making a simple pair of gloves.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Atelloune."
8,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_SEQ_08","Enion tries on the bearskin gloves and is thrilled to find they are a perfect fit. Though the skin could not be salvaged to make a mount, Atelloune is thankful some good has come from the bear's sacrifice. She bids you rest and prepare as she considers another suitable subject for mounting.

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Atelloune upon reaching level 68."

49,"TEXT_CLSTAN650_02611_ATELLOUNE_000_001","Yet even so, I find it curious no one has inquired about its distinctive hair and hooves. You would think such stark differences from your typical dhalmel would compel even a handful of people to ask."
