49,"TEXT_STMBDZ224_02696_UROKUZU_000_001","The other day one of our younger Kojin was out fishing when he was attacked and seriously injured. He was unable to identify his assailant, but many suspect it might be the doing of a coralshell. Around this time they begin laying eggs and can be very aggressive."
