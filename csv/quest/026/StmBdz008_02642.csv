49,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_001","One of our new recruits was supposed to make a short patrol around the Comet's Tail, an' he should've been back at least a few bells ago. I want you to come with me an' make sure he's alright. Follow me."
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_010","There you are. I found him, but it seems we've got another problem.
Go on, tell <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> what you told me."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_YOUNGSOLDIER02642_000_011","R-Right. I was making my rounds, as I always do, when I was assaulted by a group of giant spiders! I panicked and ran, but in my haste I dropped my satchel, which contained a rather important set of documents."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_YOUNGSOLDIER02642_000_012","I came back here to retrieve them, but...the spiders... <shudder> They took the bag and went down into that rather large hole over there. I meant to go after them, but I considered having to fight them off in the dark, and soon thought better of it."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_013","I think I know how to flush 'em out. They don't take too kindly to loud noises. Here, take a few o' these firecrackers an' toss 'em down there."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_YOUNGSOLDIER02642_000_014","...Legs... So many legs..."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_015","Those fireworks are sure to flush the bastards out o' hiding."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_SYSTEM_000_016","The firecrackers snap and pop as they fall into the hole."
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_017","Used all of 'em? Good."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_018","When the spiders skitter out into the open, that'll be your chance to strike. You'll need to be quick. Otherwise they're like to retreat to the shadows. If you jump down, you can get the drop on 'em."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_SYSTEM_100_018","To flush the gorged spinners out of hiding, you must jump down to the designated location while dismounted."

62,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_SYSTEM_000_020","You see no sign of spiders, but you can feel their eyes upon you. Perhaps you should jump down from above and take them by surprise."
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_030","Holy hells, I didn't think you'd actually do it!"
64,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_YOUNGSOLDIER02642_000_031","That was incredible! Thank you, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>. Now we can go and retrieve my satchel."
65,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_032","Ahem. Well, there's no need to rush. It's been a long day, an' I'm sure the satchel's not goin' anywhere. For now let's head back to Castrum Oriens where I can give you proper thanks."

67,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_040","Thanks again for your help. All that's left is to go an' retrieve those documents, an' hopefully forget all this ever happened."
68,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_041","You see, this isn't the first time I've dealt with those spiders. I was born an' raised in these parts, an' I've hunted more than my fair share o' those eight-legged nightmares in my time. It's why I knew to use those firecrackers."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_042","East End used to be teemin' with 'em, an' I thought we'd wiped 'em all out. <sigh> Apparently not..."
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_043","I can only hope this doesn't mean we've got an infestation on our hands. If more o' those things start turnin' up again, you can bet I'll be ready."
