0,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEQ_00","Forgemaster Brithael has a twinkle in his eye that suggests he would like to make yet another request of you."
1,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEQ_01","Forgemaster Brithael has received a request from a man named Shinto in the Far East, who has asked for the guild's most talented blacksmith to forge him a weapon. This seemingly standard commission, however, comes with an odd stipulation, which is that neither of you should mention anything about this to Sekka. While Brithael briefly puzzles over its implications, he tells you that you─the best smithy─will be going to fulfill Shinto's order. Make your way to the ferry docks and see what this mysterious Far Eastern man would have you forge."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEQ_02","Shinto hands you a hunk of rusted iron, and asks that you use it to create a katana. It seems the poor-quality metal is all the man can afford. Recognizing that this will be a challenging task, he urges you first consult Sekka before setting to work. As you make ready to leave, he gives you one last stern reminder to keep his identity a secret from her. Make your way to Anchor Yard and see if Sekka can assist you."
3,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEQ_03","Given the high percentage of impurities and rust in the metal, Sekka proposes focusing solely on cultivating the durability of the blade as opposed to its sharpness. She fears that if you were to fold the already brittle iron too many times, it will make the blade prone to breakage. Suggesting you attempt to make a heavy uchigatana, she hands you half of the iron hunk, and holds on to the rest should you need to try again later. Make a high-quality heavy uchigatana and deliver it to Shinto, who awaits you at the docks.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Sekka."
4,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEQ_04","Shinto begins by criticizing your work, saying that the shoddy craftsmanship trumps that of even the lesser swordsmiths of the Far East─or, at least, that is the critique he would have given you had you been furnished with decent materials. As it stands, he is impressed by the fact that you were even able to create an uchigatana, however poor, from the rusted iron he provided you with. Shinto then bids you return to Forgemaster Brithael to tell him that he is satisfied with your performance."
5,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEQ_05","You learn that Shinto is, in fact, Sekka's father and has come to take her back to Kugane. He tells her that it is past time she gave up on her dream of becoming his apprentice as she lacks the fundamental skills it takes to become a swordsmith. Brithael, however, is of a different opinion, and tells Shinto off for his disparaging and overly critical comments. After exchanging a few more scathing remarks, Shinto walks out, beckoning his daughter to follow him. Forgemaster Brithael─out of a mixture of sympathy and fear that she will remain indefinitely at his guild─turns to Sekka before she leaves and promises to help her think of a way to gain her father's approval and fulfill her greatest desire.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 68."

49,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_BRITHAEL_000_001","That's not to say, however, that ye can rest on yer oars just yet. Not too soon before ye arrived, we received a rather peculiar request."
50,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_BRITHAEL_000_002","It's from a man in Kugane named Shinto. He's askin' that our best smitty forge him a weapon. Seems pretty standard, right? Well, it's not."
51,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_BRITHAEL_000_003","It came with one very interestin' condition. He's asked that we not mention a word of this to Sekka."
52,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_BRITHAEL_000_004","Curious, ain't it? Why does he want to remain anonymous, and moreover, how does he know the girl is here?"
53,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_BRITHAEL_000_005","While I don't have the answer to either of those questions, there's one thing I know for certain: yer our best smitty. Our client should be arrivin' soon so ye best hurry to the docks. Any questions? Good. Now off ye go."

58,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_040","Is that so? Then this may be a rather demanding assignment. If your forgemaster believes you capable, however, I shall go against my better judgment and nevertheless entrust you with <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>..."
59,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_050","What you hold in your hands is a hunk of rusted iron. I would like for you to forge a heavy uchigatana using this."

61,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_052","I agree it is far from ideal. Had my savings not been lost to unexpected expenses along the way, perhaps I would have been able to provide you with better metal to work with, but alas, this is all I can currently offer."
62,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_053","That said, I do not think it by any means an impossible task─especially not for one of your purported talent."

67,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_070","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? What brings you here?"
68,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_080","You have been tasked with forging an uchigatana from this rubbish!? Even the realm's greatest masters would struggle to do so with iron this poor. What idiot would ask such an outrageous thing of you?"

72,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_110","Still, this is absurd. There are so many impurities in this metal that any blade forged from it will be extremely brittle."
73,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_111","Should the katana shatter during battle, the wielder's life will be forfeit. To preserve what little durability is present in these brittle hunks, we must refrain from folding the metal too many times. As such, you best make a heavy uchigatana."
74,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_112","While the rust appears to be overwhelming, I think we have enough workable iron to make a full blade. Take half. I shall hold on to the rest in case we need to try again."
75,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_120","You need more metal? Here you go."
76,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_130","You are truly gifted. To think that you would be able to forge anything resembling a katana, much less one of this quality, is nothing short of miraculous. Let us deliver this to the client as promised. They will no doubt be pleased."
77,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_140","So you have returned. Have you finished the uchigatana that I requested?"
78,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_150","...This blade─it is so rough-hewn, it does not even come close to matching the skill of even the lesser swordsmiths of the Far East."
79,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_151","Or, at least, that is what I would say had I provided you with decent materials to work with. As it stands, the fact that you managed to craft a working uchigatana from the iron I gave you shows me you are an artisan of surpassing skill."
80,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_152","I have witnessed firsthand that your reputation is well founded. Tell Master Brithael I am satisfied with your performance."
81,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SEKKA_000_160","Please, sir. I will do anything you assign to me without any complaints this time. I promise!"

88,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_176","She simply does not have what it takes to become a swordsmith. It is time she realized this and looked to pursuing something better suited to her talents─or lack thereof."

90,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_SHINTOU_000_178","And to think the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> does not even have a fraction of the knowledge you do. A decade's worth of practice has amounted to nothing."
91,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_BRITHAEL_000_179","For ye to lecture yer daughter on her behavior is one thing, but I will not have ye puttin' her down an' worse─usin' <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> to do it! Sekka may still have a ways to go before she's a master, but she's got talent and puts in a great deal of effort."
92,"TEXT_CLSBSM650_02617_BRITHAEL_000_180","I don't know who you think you are, but even if ye happen to be the finest swordsmith to have ever lived, it still doesn't give ye the right to tell a person to abandon their dreams!"
