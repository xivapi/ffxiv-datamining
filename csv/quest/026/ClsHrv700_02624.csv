1,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SEQ_01","A jubilant Edgyth explains to you that a cure for the Mudplots' bad case of eelworm has finally been found. She invites you to join her at the Botanists' Guild to discuss this solution with Fufucha and the others. You ready yourself for the journey in the knowledge that the end of this popoto peril is finally in sight."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SEQ_02","Once everyone has been accounted for at the guild, Fufucha gives the signal to Sawney to explain his findings. It becomes apparent that there are two solutions to the issue, both recorded in the Sharlayan records Sawney and Edgyth had been examining. It is quickly established that neither alchemy nor companion farming will avail on their own, and Fufucha recommends you utilize a mixture of the two. You are instructed to head to Castrum Oriens in order to search for a flower named Rhalgr's streak that will form a key part of Fufucha's plan."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SEQ_03","Edgyth is told by a Twin Adder officer that a flower with strikingly similar characteristics to Rhalgr's streak used to be cultivated in Ala Ghiri. The officer also offers unsolicited advice that the area is “no place for little lady botanists.” Undeterred by the overbearing officer, the two of you make tracks for Ala Ghiri."
4,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SEQ_04","Edgyth initially struggles to get the attention of the locals; however, you are confident that the two of you together should be able able to learn something of use."
5,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SEQ_05","It seems that Rhalgr's streak was originally brought to Ala Ghiri to deal with a pest problem not unlike your own. While opinions on the flower's scent vary wildly, you learn that it most likely grows in a mountainous part of the Lochs."
6,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SEQ_06","Edgyth elects to head back to Greengrub Mudplots to ready them for your return. It is left to you to hunt for Rhalgr's streak alone. You steel yourself for the search ahead."
7,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SEQ_07","Upon your return to the Mudplots, you quickly set about planting the Rhalgr's streaks, marking the end of your involvement in Idyllshire's agricultural affairs. Fufucha bestows upon Edgyth not one, but two gifts: the very garb worn by Fufucha herself and a new title. The newly appointed first botanist of Idyllshire is slightly overwhelmed by these gestures at first, but swears she will put Idyllshire on the botanic map."

53,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_FUFUCHA_000_011","I see everyone is present and accounted for; let us begin."
54,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SAWNEY_000_012","Sounds like my cue! Edgyth and I managed to find a solution─two, actually─to this eelworm infestation. We can choose to put our faith in either alchemy or...what was it called again? Ah yes, companion planting."
55,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_EDGYTH_000_013","While alchemy is the more potent of the two, it does have its downsides. For one, it has equally potent side effects, and if any concoction we use happens to scatter further than we planned, it could wreak all manner of havoc on the environment."
56,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_FUFUCHA_000_014","In which case, the only option realistically available to us is to make use of a blend of the two. I know enough about botanic alchemy to cover that aspect, but companion planting may prove somewhat difficult to utilize."
57,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SAWNEY_000_014","I don't want to make a fool of myself, but could someone explain to me what companion planting is exactly?"
58,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_FUFUCHA_000_015","Simply put, it is the process of planting different crops in close proximity, so that they may mutually benefit one another. These benefits vary from stimulating the growth of neighboring crops to increasing yields. Oh, and perhaps most interestingly, it can also help prevent pest damage."
59,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_EDGYTH_000_016","In the case of eelworm infestation, a flowering plant called Rhalgr's streak is said to be effective. However, sadly for us, there are none left in Saint Mocianne's Arboretum."
60,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_FUFUCHA_000_017","I can say with confidence that we have never had any at the guild either. However, I do have an idea as to where they may be found."
61,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_FUFUCHA_000_018","The flower owes its name to Rhalgr, the guardian deity of Ala Mhigo. I daresay you stand a good chance of finding it in Gyr Abania, where faith in the Destroyer has ever been strong. It stands to reason that the flower would grow in the area."
62,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_SAWNEY_000_019","And that's where you come in, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Do you reckon you'd be up to travelin' to Gyr Abania and trackin' down this elusive plant on our behalf?"

76,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_EDGYTH_000_070","Well, this seems to be the place. Let's try asking around about Rhalgr's streak."

78,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_FRAUNK_000_080","Rhalgr's streak? I stocked the stuff for a while, but then the area's pest problem got sorted out and nobody wanted it anymore. The smell wasn't for everyone, you see."
79,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_GERBOD_000_090","Ah, yes. They were brought here from the Lochs for their pest-preventing qualities. No idea what was done with 'em after the vermin problem had been solved, mind you. You might have better luck asking someone else. Sorry, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>."
80,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_ALDRUTH_000_100","Now that's a name I've not heard in a fair while. Memory's a bit foggy, but I'm pretty sure it was a wildflower found far out in the mountains. Who knows, there could still be a patch of them growing somewhere."
81,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_FRAUNK_000_110","Oof, just remembering that smell is enough to make my nose close up. Happy to have seen the last of that flower, I am."
82,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_GERBOD_000_111","From what I've heard it's native to the Lochs. Sad to say that's as far as my knowledge stretches."
83,"TEXT_CLSHRV700_02624_ALDRUTH_000_112","From what I know, it's a wildflower found on the mountains near the Lochs. If you're in luck, there might still be a patch of them growing somewhere."
