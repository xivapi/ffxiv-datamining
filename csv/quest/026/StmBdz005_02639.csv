Your assistance is greatly appreciated. The drones were not in our possession for very long, but a cursory inspection showed they are made with a heretofore unknown metal alloy."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_GNIBNPHA_000_011","They are all but impervious to traditional firearms, which is why we commissioned Garlond Ironworks to fashion a weapon capable of penetrating their armor."

58,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_020","Welcome back. I take it the drones have been disposed of, then. Excellent work."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_021","We were quite fortunate for your presence. Save for Lieutenant G'nibnpha, none of my men can even activate a suit of magitek armor, let alone pilot one in combat."
60,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_022","I only pray that isn't to our detriment in the future. There's still plenty more of those drones out there along Baelsar's Wall. If any more of them should suddenly stir..."
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_023","At any rate, we will continue working with Garlond Ironworks so that should such a day come, we will be ready."
