49,"TEXT_STMBDZ220_02692_KAIOKE_000_001","You see, a couple times a year we will hold a village-wide banquet where each person brings their own signature dish. As I have been charged with organizing the event, attending to the main preparations has left me with little time to collect the necessary ingredients for my food!"
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ220_02692_KAIOKE_000_002","Nearly everyone has finished making theirs, but I have yet to even begin! Readying the broth takes the longest, so I must start that now. To complete it, however, I need the legs of two giant coralshells."

52,"TEXT_STMBDZ220_02692_KAIOKE_100_003","They can be found on the coast of Onokoro. Here─take this bait. Giant coralshells are reticent creatures but the smell of that should be enough to attract them out of hiding."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ220_02692_KAIOKE_000_004","Please bring me legs of two giant coralshells. In the meantime, I shall put a pot on the stove and begin preparing my broth."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ220_02692_KAIOKE_000_011","Haha! Look at the size of these legs! Added to that, the meat inside appears very tender and succulent. Once they are added to the stew and boiled, it will be ready to serve!"
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ220_02692_KAIOKE_000_012","Truth be told, these banquets are not all about having fun. In fact, some might say it is a silent competition to see who can serve the best food. The individual to bring the most delicious dish is usually awarded the honor of hosting the next one."
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ220_02692_KAIOKE_000_013","Thanks to you and these delicious legs you have brought back for me, my victory is all but guaranteed!"
