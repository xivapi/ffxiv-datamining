※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_01","Jihli Aliapoh is happy to meet you in this most auspicious season of Hatching–tide, a celebration inspired by her annual prophetic dreams of the legendary Twelve Archons. This year's vision, she admits, was rather unusual in that it prominently featured tonberries, creatures of myth known less for their seasonal whimsy than their habit of mercilessly stabbing things. This peculiarity is but the first of two complications facing the festivities this year─a group of sylphs is currently dismantling decorations, harrassing residents, and otherwise making a nuisance of themselves in Gridania. For an irony, the first oddity will serve to ameliorate the second, or so claims Jihli's eager new volunteer, Hamlyn. As a self-proclaimed tonberry connoisseur, Hamlyn assures you that approaching the sylphs disguised as such a terrifying (yet adorable?) creature will be sure to drive them off, and it just so happens he has a tonberry costume in your size...

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_02","Hamlyn eagerly paws you into a tonberry guise and you set off to deter any rascally sylphs you might find. While this is not how you anticipated spending your Hatching–tide, you comfort yourself with the knowledge that you will be enjoying the festivities in no time.

※You must be wearing the tonberry guise to complete this task."
3,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_03","You successfully shoo away a bevy of trouble-making sylphs. Surely not even Hamlyn's uncomfortable heavy breathing will dampen your feeling of accomplishment...probably."
4,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_04","After pawing you out of the tonberry guise again, Hamlyn bids you share your report with Jihli. The eyes of his tonberry mask glint as he clutches your slightly sweaty costume in both hands. Best not to think too hard about it."
5,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_05","Jihli is delighted to hear that the sylphs' mischief has been thwarted and that festival preparations are once more proceeding apace, but Nonotta shatters this fragile relief with panicked reports of mayhem in the Central Shroud. The caravan of Archon eggs─a most crucial decoration─has been beset upon by angry sylphs and the delivery mammet is malfunctioning in its attempt to prevent total highroad robbery. In this moment of distress, Hamlyn giggles his delight, as he claims to have a brilliant plan that is sure to save the day. You need only ask..."
