1,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_01","X'rhun explains the Empire's plan to assassinate the deputy president of Garlond Ironworks, and outlines an idea to foil the attempt. After meeting with Jessie herself and hammering out the finer details, he promises to meet you on the terrace above Rowena's House of Splendors in Revenant's Toll."
2,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_02","You rendezvous with your companions in Revenant's Toll, and although Jessie seems content to act as bait, X'rhun has reservations about placing her in the path of danger. Arya suddenly offers to disguise herself as the deputy president, and a new plan evolves around her unexpected suggestion. Meet X'rhun by the aetheryte in Revenant's Toll for a final briefing."
3,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_03","You meet with your comrades, and X'rhun confesses how he is yet baffled by Lambard's betrayal of the Crimson Duelists for imperial coin. Resolved to bring him to justice, however, he bids you assemble by the southeast gate to begin your operation."
4,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_04","Your mission to turn the cabal's ambush against them has begun. Follow Arya on the path to north Silvertear, and defend her from any attackers."
5,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_05","You have foiled the first ambush. Continue onwards to the south, and rescue Arya from the cabal's attacks."
6,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_06","After defeating the second wave of ambushers, you are contacted with further instructions from X'rhun. It seems the Crimson Duelist has dispatched the flanking group, and is certain that Lambard will soon be lured into the fray. Take up position by the airship near the Keeper of the Lake, and wait for the assassins' master to appear."
7,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_07","Lambard steps from the shadows to finish the job, and X'rhun breaks from his own concealment to confront him. Despite X'rhun's superior skill in battle, however, the veteran red mage is overcome by Lambard's sinister powers. You and Arya leap to your fallen companion's defense, and fight a desperate battle against ancient magicks and forbidden arts. Together you succeed in defeating Lambard, and can now see to the gravely injured X'rhun."
8,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_08","X'rhun is badly wounded, but it appears he will survive to fight another day. Speak with your mentor back in Revenant's Toll."
9,"TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_SEQ_09","Through the combined efforts of you and your fellow red mages, the plot to assassinate Garlond Ironworks' deputy president has ended in failure. In addition to Jessie's gratitude, X'rhun expresses his own thanks to you and Arya for helping him put right the wrongs of his past. Lambard and his cabal are no more, and your mastery of red magic has won a tangible victory for the good of the realm.

※The next red mage quest will be available from X'rhun Tia once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"
