1,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SEQ_01","You are discussing the matter of Shatotto's sudden appearance with Lalai when Zhai'a Nelhah dashes breathlessly onto the scene. The Hearer brings grave tidings from the Twelveswood─a pack of golems has escaped from the ruins of the Lost City of Amdapor and now threatens to run roughshod over the forest. As if spurred to action, the memory of Shatotto stirs, and dashes off with Lalai's corporeal body in tow to see to the threat as only she knows how. At the Hearer's behest, you make for the Shroud to see what news the Wailer Alphene has of the threat."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SEQ_02","Alphene is at a loss, but the ever-insightful Shatotto surmises that the golems you seek are hiding in plain sight. Fortunately, she has a means to tell inanimate stone from foe. Incinerate any suspicious-looking stone structures with your most potent fire magic, and lay waste to any rampaging golems that might manifest themselves in the process."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SEQ_03","Following Shatotto's advice to the letter, you make short work of three meddlesome golems. Seek out Shatotto and hope that she is as pleased with your efforts as she undoubtedly is with her own."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SEQ_04","At least moderately impressed with your command of the destructive arts, Shatotto deigns to share with you and your friends the nature of the threat the realm faces. As she tells it, two millennia ago when she still lived, a wayward comet threatened to crash into the city of Mhach─a crisis averted by the power of black magic, an art which she had devised at least in part for that very task. Fragments that broke off the comet hurtled to the earth, and were later unearthed, affording the mages of the realm untold powers. There remains, however, a further complication. Shatotto posits that the stones call out to each other with aetheric signals, augmenting each other's power─a phenomenon which could result in disaster should the comet once again draw near, as Shatotto predicts will happen in the days to come. Zhai'a Nelhah is naturally skeptical, but nonetheless is determined to do his part to see that the realm does not come to peril. Reconvene with your friends at Milvaneth Sacrarium, that you might formulate a plan of attack."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SEQ_05","Back at the Sacrarium, Shatotto returns to her slumber, and you are rejoined by Lalai. After a testy exchange with Zhai'a Nelhah─who is skeptical of Shatotto's methods, if not her intentions─she goes off to consult with your beastman allies, encouraging you to devote yourself to your studies that you might be prepared for the trials to come.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 65."

49,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_LALAI_000_001","In particular, I was surprised to learn that while the statue in Nald's Reflection is a relatively recent construction─in historical terms, of course─the goblet it holds in its hands is quite ancient.

50,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_LALAI_000_002","Master's record goes on to state that the inner surface of the goblet is inscribed with a message in the glyphs of ancient Mhach. It reads─ah yes, here it is."

79,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SHATOTTO_000_072","Oh dear, you really aren't very smart. Very well, I shall begin from the very─er, beginning. Dear me, did I almost rhyme?

80,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SHATOTTO_000_073","Our scholars ascertained that a mighty comet─awash with unspeakable aetherial energy─was on course to strike our fair home and reduce it to so much rubble.

81,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SHATOTTO_000_074","This, more than anything, was what spurred me to developing the art of black magic as it is known today. Needless to say, my plan was a remarkable success.

83,"TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SHATOTTO_000_076","Needless to say, these otherworldly stones drew the attention of mages far and wide, who sought to claim their powers for their own. These are the stones that gave the golems their souls─by whose powers many a city–state flourished."
