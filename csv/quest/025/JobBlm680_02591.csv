1,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SEQ_01","Lalai has been in close communication with Shatotto, who is ready to commence the final stage of her plan. That said, even the ever-confident mother of black magic would not go at it alone. And so it is that you and Lalai set out for Burgundy Falls in the hopes of conferring with your beastman allies."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SEQ_02","No sooner have your allies given you a warm welcome than you are joined once more by the reawakened memory of Shatotto, who shares her latest insights into the golem menace. It would appear that the greatest threat is posed not by the man-made creatures that you have faced thus far, but rather self-animated monstrosities formed of materials attracted by the burgeoning aetheric power of the gemstones. In hopes of assessing the true nature of the threat, the Hearer Zhai'a Nelhah sets out in one direction in the company of the beastman trio, entrusting you and Shatotto to look into troubling reports from the village of Ala Gannha."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SEQ_03","You arrive in Ala Gannha to find no sign of the animated monstrosities you seek. At Shatotto's suggestion, you split up to cover more ground and properly survey the surrounding wilderness."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SEQ_04","Your search bears fruit, as you come to discover─and promptly dispatch─two golems made of wood that would seem to prove Shatotto's hypothesis. Venture back to the east and see how the sorceress fares."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SEQ_05","You find Shatotto standing over the crumpled forms of two golems who were unfortunate enough to have crossed her path. She congratulates you on your own efforts, then shares a troubling sight she witnessed. As she tells it, the golems are turning upon each other, as if driven by an animal instinct to seek greater and greater power. Your conversation is interrupted by a linkpearl transmission from Zhai'a Nelhah, who claims to have witnessed a still more fearsome sight─a veritable legion of golems assembling in Dravania for purposes unknown. As Shatotto and the Hearer make for the Observatorium to see what has been learned of the comet, you set off on a return path to Burgundy Falls, that you and your beastman friends might discuss your next course of action."
6,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SEQ_06","Putting together all the knowledge at your disposal, Shatotto is able to reason out the golems' ultimate goal: they converge as one upon Sohm Al in hopes of summoning the ultimate source of power─the calamitous comet Shatotto blasted out of the heavens some two thousand years ago─back to Eorzea, where they would feast upon its aether. In the face of certain doom, Shatotto reveals her master plan: put simply, you will wait for the golems to cannibalize each other time and again until but a single golem remains. You will then confront this creation─the mother of all golems, as it were─and blast it to tiny fragments with the power of your black magic. For whatever it is worth, Shatotto and Zhai'a Nelhah appear to have the utmost confidence in your ability to succeed in this daunting task. As Shatotto prepares to return to slumber in anticipation of the final confrontation, you, too, make for Ul'dah, that you might speak with Lalai one last time before resuming your studies."
7,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SEQ_07","You return to the Sacrarium to find Lalai having regained her consciousness, with a message from Shatotto instructing you to ready yourself well for the battle to come. You take your leave, determined to master the art of destruction to levels heretofore scarcely fathomed.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 70."

60,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SHATOTTO_000_044","If the Hearer speaks true, the golems that have been causing trouble near the city–states have been more bark than bite─felled with no great difficulty by middling soldiers. From this, I surmise that the gems set within them─their soulstones─have been small and of meager power at best."
61,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_SHATOTTO_000_045","And yet if my theory holds, a more sinister threat lurks in the realm's far reaches, far from the prodding eyes of Eorzean and beastman alike. This is where we must go."

65,"TEXT_JOBBLM680_02591_ZHAIANELHAH_000_049","The larger the gem that serves as their soulstone, the greater their power─and the greater the threat when the comet draws nigh. It would appear our task is clear."
