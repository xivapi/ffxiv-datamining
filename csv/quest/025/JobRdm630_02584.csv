1,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_SEQ_01","X'rhun proposes a journey to the mountains of Gyr Abania, where you will visit the Ziggurat built by the red mages of eld. Within that ancient edifice, your mentor hopes to uncover clues to treating Arya's condition─just as he once unearthed the secrets of red magic alongside Lambard long ago. Travel to the region of Gyr Abania, and join X'rhun near the centuries-old monument."
2,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_SEQ_02","You meet X'rhun near the Ziggurat, and after a brief history lesson he sets you to work searching for records of Lambard's transformation ritual. Head into the ruins, and seek out any remaining stone tablets."
3,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_SEQ_03","You have obtained three stone tablets in varying degrees of degradation. Deliver them to X'rhun Tia."
4,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_SEQ_04","X'rhun glances over the tablets you have brought, and finds one that details a rite by which a mage would ingest the blood of a voidsent in exchange for supernatural power. The description of the hunger which befell such mages is uncannily similar to Arya's condition. Believing that the tonic explained on the same tablet should be effective in relieving your companion's suffering, X'rhun bids you procure the concoction's main ingredient: a massive urolith's core. Make your way to the Sleeping Stones, and engage the largest specimen you can find."
5,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_SEQ_05","You have defeated an unbreakable urolith, and liberated its pulsating core. Seek out X'rhun Tia in the Gyr Abanian hamlet of Ala Gannha, and hand over the ingredient."
6,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_SEQ_06","With the materials for the tonic in hand, X'rhun appears eager to call upon the expertise of the alchemists of Ul'dah. Whilst your mentor is busy having the concoction prepared, return to Idyllshire and apprise Arya of your progress."
7,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_SEQ_07","Upon imbibing the alchemical mixture, Arya seems to recover almost immediately from her weakened state. X'rhun is quick to remind her, however, that any arcane exertion could soon send her back into a state of mindless hunger. Continue to hone your own skills that you might better aid Arya in returning to her beloved journey along the path of the red mage.

※The next red mage quest will be available from X'rhun upon reaching level 65."

And I hate that I still feel so weak. I promise to stay in bed like a good girl until I'm fully recovered."

70,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_121","Did I mention that it was our forebears in the art who constructed the Ziggurat? It was built to suppress the unstable weather that was whipped up in the wake of that era's Calamity─a sort of dampening weight that slowed the land's raging currents of aether to a trickle."
71,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_100_121","In time, however, the Ziggurat also became a library, where successive generations of red mages enshrined their stories and their secrets.

75,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_161","It appears to be a record from a time before red magic was unified as a distinct discipline. The passage describes a rite by which one can make a pact with a voidsent, and ingest its blood in exchange for supernatural power!"
76,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_162","Even amongst their kin, certain creatures of the void harbor a voracious appetite for living aether. Lambard must have acquired the ability to siphon his victims' life force from one such fiend..."
77,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_163","The practice in question is said to have started with a family of Mhachi sorcerers, who lived in the era preceding the Sixth Umbral Calamity. For red mages, whose arts draw so heavily upon their own aether, there is an obvious─if distasteful─advantage to stealing a foe's life energies."
78,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_100_163","And if one can employ such energies to fortify and sustain one's own form, as Lambard did, then one can even wield magicks beyond the limitations of ordinary mortals."
79,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_164","Not surprisingly, however, its tendency to result in aether-starved madmen led to the rite being declared a forbidden art."

81,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_166","Arya's transformation was strikingly similar to Lambard's. Surely this concoction would prove effective at curbing her condition as well!"
82,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_167","Let's see here. It seems the main ingredient is a chunk of semi-crystallized aether. Such a substance could be drawn from the core of an urolith─and I'm thinking the bigger the better."
83,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_168","If I recall correctly, there are uroliths to be found to the east, in the vicinity of the Sleeping Stones. Pray find yourself one of the larger specimens and procure an aetherial core."
84,"TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_169","Once you have what we need, we can rendezvous in the hamlet of Ala Gannha. I shall busy myself collecting the other ingredients."
