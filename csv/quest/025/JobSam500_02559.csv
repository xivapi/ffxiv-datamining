To hear him tell it, an elderly Far Eastern gentleman is calling for challengers as pre-fight entertainment, but contrary to all expectations, he has been dropping both opponents and viewers' jaws with his sublime skills. Finding your interest piqued in these Far Eastern warriors known as samurai, you consider seeking out the silver-tongued showmaster."

If you believe you have what it takes, the showmaster instructs you to make yourself known to the Far Eastern elder within the Gladiators' Guild."
3,"TEXT_JOBSAM500_02559_SEQ_03","Introducing himself as Musosai, the Far Eastern elder lends you an unusual sword and what appears to be a soulstone for your duel. Take up the mythrite uchigatana and wear the stone upon your person, and you will become a samurai in name─if not in sooth.
