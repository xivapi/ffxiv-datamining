1,"TEXT_JOBRDM650_02585_SEQ_01","X'rhun has recalled a particular book that Lambard would read with uncommon intensity, and wonders if it might contain a clue to Arya's condition. Remembering little of the rare tome aside from its macabre contents, your mentor bids you take Arya, and make an inquiry with Idyllshire's foremost treasure hunter, Midnight Dew."
2,"TEXT_JOBRDM650_02585_SEQ_02","You describe the heretic's memoirs to Midnight Dew, and she is put in mind of a rare book spotted by a colleague in the depths of the Great Gubal Library. Return to Rowena's Center for Cultural Promotion, and tell X'rhun of the <Emphasis>Nightkin</Emphasis>."
3,"TEXT_JOBRDM650_02585_SEQ_03","Upon hearing the book's title, X'rhun seems confident that the <Emphasis>Nightkin</Emphasis> is indeed the work you seek. Journey through the wilds of the Dravanian hinterlands to the Great Gubal Library, and prepare to guide your mentor through its now-darkened halls."
4,"TEXT_JOBRDM650_02585_SEQ_04","You have fought your way through to Rhapsodies Quadrangle, and obtained the elusive <Emphasis>Nightkin</Emphasis> memoirs. Speak to X'rhun outside the library, and allow him to more fully peruse its contents."
5,"TEXT_JOBRDM650_02585_SEQ_05","After confirming the book's authenticity, X'rhun hints that the information contained within will be of great interest to Arya. Return to Idyllshire, and join your colleagues inside Rowena's establishment."
6,"TEXT_JOBRDM650_02585_SEQ_06","X'rhun shares with you the tale of the <Emphasis>Nightkin</Emphasis> and its author. From its pages, he has gleaned that Lambard and Arya are both descendants of a Mhachi sorcerer─an archmagus who forged a dark pact with the voidsent Lilith, and took her blood inside his own body. According to the story, the first Calowise then entrapped the fiendish queen upon the physical plane to preserve the potency of her gift. Thus do you come to the conclusion that the path to lifting the curse of Arya's affliction lies in releasing Lilith's soul to the void. X'rhun means to follow the clues in the memoirs to uncover the voidsent's prison, but first insists that you rest and prepare for the adventure which lies ahead!

※The next red mage quest will be available from X'rhun Tia upon reaching level 68."
