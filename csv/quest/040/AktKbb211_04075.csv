1,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_SEQ_01","Sufficiently impressed with your growth, Drusilla declares you ready to face her voidsent nemesis, Orcus. Arnegis and Hermin, another of her trusted Lemures, tell of a woodcutter gone missing in the Central Shroud, and a man with pale skin and fiery eyes spotted nearby that matches Orcus's description. Before you can depart, however, Hermin voices concerns regarding your involvement in the secretive group's affairs, prompting Drusilla to reveal her personal history with the wicked voidsent, who murdered every member of her flesh-and-blood family. Acutely aware of the threat Orcus poses, Drusilla is willing to rely on any and every advantage, including the assistance of an outsider. With the matter settled, you depart for Bentbranch Meadows to begin the search for your murderous prey."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_SEQ_02","Arnegis explains that the woodcutter in question was last seen heading northwest of Bentbranch Meadows, and Drusilla unveils the means by which you will draw Orcus out into the open. She presents you with a blood-scented candle and a magitek transceiver, instructing you to light the former to draw out any nearby fiends. If Orcus happens to be among them, she asks you to call her on the transceiver so she can come to your aid."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_SEQ_03","The candle works just as well as Drusilla said, drawing out a slavering voidsent which you quickly dispatch. The monster does not appear to be Orcus, but does leave behind a blood-soaked ring. Arnegis may be able to shed some light on the nature of this trinket and how a voidsent would come into possession of it."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_SEQ_04","Drusilla tells you and Arnegis that she found a body hastily buried under some overgrowth─a body which matched the description of the woodcutter and bore the mark of a ring removed from its finger. It seems that the voidsent you drew forth from the woods killed the man to claim the object of its obsession. While Orcus is nowhere to be found, there is one less monster preying on defenseless souls. Arnegis leaves to apprise the Wood Wailers of what transpired, and Drusilla asks you to return with her to Lemures headquarters.

※You may re-enter Lemures headquarters by speaking with the loyal Lemure in Pearl Lane."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_SEQ_05","While the mood in Lemures headquarters is somber, Drusilla reminds you that the realm is safer for your efforts. Hermin chimes in to say that she found a promising bit of information while you were away that Arnegis is already investigating. His work is delicate, however, and will take some time to be completed to satisfaction. Drusilla bids you practice your trade further, so that when Orcus is finally found, victory will be all but assured.

※The next reaper quest will be available from Drusilla upon reaching level 75."

50,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_003","Everyone here? Good."
51,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_004","Arnegis you've met. No further chimera-related incidents, you'll be happy to hear. The overly chipper lass over there is Hermin. Make your acquaintances."
52,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_005","As you know, our quarry is a voidsent, and he goes by the name Orcus. He's eluded the best, but these two are a step above that. Tell us what you've found."

54,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_007","There's as many missing people as there are grains of sand, and no shortage of tragedies either. One, however, stood out among the rest."
55,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_008","A woodcutter in the Black Shroud─disappeared without a trace. No body, no belongings, nothing. An odd enough occurrence by itself, but the sightings of a stranger with skin pale as snow near his last known whereabouts piqued our interest."
56,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_009","Now that's a promisin' start, but those woods are crawlin' with bandits and brigands of all sorts. Duskwights and Keepers are said to come in ghostly hues. Are we sure this man ain't one of them?"
57,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_010","As sure as I've ever been, Boss. Not many bandits have eyes the color of blood. It's a match too close to ignore."

62,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_015","But trust me when I say we need every advantage we can afford. I made the mistake of misjudgin' Orcus's strength before, and for my hubris my family─my flesh-and-blood family─was slain. All of them."
63,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_016","Was plannin' on holdin' that back a bit longer, but aye, 'twas before the Lemures.

64,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_HERMIN_000_017","You don't have to ask twice, Boss. Your wounds are our wounds, even the ones that become scars. We'll see your vengeance wrought."

66,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_019","And it ain't just for me that we have to hunt him down, either. He's a blight on Eorzea itself, and the longer we let it fester, the more suffering it'll spread."

70,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_023","By your will, Boss. That'd be the Central Shroud, so our best course would be to set off from Bentbranch Meadows."

73,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_040","Orcus is an accursed name, feared from Garlemald to Ala Mhigo. I hear tell the people of Gyr Abania bestowed it on a fiend that feasts on the bones of man, so much does it reek of evil incarnate."
74,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_050","Good, you made it. Before we set off, allow me to share the circumstances of our poor woodcutter's disappearance."
75,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_051","As I heard it, he disappeared nigh on a week ago. Got lost, some surmise, but he was a seasoned woodsman, not some highborn traveler who forgot to buy a map."
76,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_052","I questioned those closest to him, and none could think of a reason he might want to make himself scarce. He'd even made plans to meet with friends not long from now, but I expect that promise will go unkept."
77,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_053","It sounds like we can rule out a voluntary departure."
78,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_054","I believe we can. The last person to see the man alive said he took his axe and ventured northwest."
79,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_055","Then that's where we'll set our trap."
80,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_056","Here, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, take these. A magitek transceiver and candle that's scented like a voidsent’s favorite libation: blood."

82,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_058","As I said before, Orcus is inhabitin' the body of a man, and he can put on an awfully convincin' performance when needs must. Don't give him a chance to work his wiles, or his fangs'll be in your neck before you know it."
83,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_100_058","As much as I want to accompany you, I'd only be a liability in a fight. Whether you find Orcus or not, return here and I'll report back to the Lemures. Good luck and good huntin'."
84,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_ARNEGIS_000_060","The boss painted a bloodcurdling picture of Orcus...skin pale as the moon and eyes like hellfire. I wouldn't want to run into such a beast on a dark night─or on a sunny day, for that matter."

94,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_086","Aye, while I was searchin' for a place to set my trap, I spotted a shallow grave, hastily dug and poorly hidden."
95,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_087","Under a thin layer of dirt was a body matchin' the description of the woodcutter. A wholly nondescript fellow, save for the mark of a ring removed from his finger."
96,"TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_DRUSILLA_000_088","Doubtless that ring was his demise. Shiny baubles are a common fixation for voidsent─probably didn't spare a thought for the owner, only the prize. I suppose we can take comfort in the knowledge that it'll harm no one else."
