1,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_SEQ_01","The sight of a scythe in your hands meets with Drusilla's approval, and she declares that you will familiarize yourself with your newfound talents through a trial by fire. One of the Lemures has sent word that a hungry beast threatens his operations in Cutter's Cry. Seeking both to aid a member of her family and get you familiar with the tools of your trade, Drusilla bids you accompany her to Cutter's Cry and combat this threat."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_SEQ_02","Arnegis explains that the area through which he transports goods has been plagued by a chimera, a beast far too ferocious for him and his crew to drive off alone. Drusilla seems confident that you can defeat it."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_SEQ_03","Issuing a few helpful hints to guide you toward murderous ends, Drusilla sends you off into the sandpit to draw blood─and the chimera's attention. But will you and your scythe be up to the challenge?"
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_SEQ_04","The deed is done, and Drusilla is impressed. She shares with you the story of how reapers came to be─how when driven from their ancestral homeland by invaders, her Garlean forebears were forced to turn to pacts with fell voidsent in order to survive. Although the strength they gained was great, it came at cost and with risks, but such were the depths of their desperation. She leaves you to think upon the lesson of this tale and asks you to return to Lemures headquarters at your leisure.

※In the event that you leave Lemures headquarters, you may re-enter by speaking with the Lemures member in Pearl Lane."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_SEQ_05","The Lemures were formed to support Garleans living in exile, as Drusilla explains. She encourages you to think about their perspective, but reminds you that regardless of whether or not you sympathize with them and their plight, she expects you to spare no effort in the pursuit of your prey. She and the other Lemures will be gathering information on the voidsent's whereabouts. In the meantime, Drusilla asks that you hone your skills until further information is uncovered.

※The next reaper quest will be available from Drusilla upon reaching level 73."

77,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_DRUSILLA_000_052","But gifts are ever the object of envy. When not tillin' the fields, our ancestors were forced to defend them. Every year they yielded a few more ilms, and some 800 years ago now they were driven from Locus Amoenus completely."
78,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_DRUSILLA_000_053","They fled north, to the frozen region that would become Garlemald. Even there, they fought tooth and nail for the scant resources of that frigid land."

82,"TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_DRUSILLA_000_056","Our way is to end battles before the sparks catch, to sacrifice the one for the many. To keep avaricious hands away from family, friends, and lovers. And now this power belongs to you."
