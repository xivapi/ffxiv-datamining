1,"TEXT_AKTKBB221_04076_SEQ_01","Headquarters is relatively quiet while the Lemures continue the work of ascertaining Orcus's whereabouts, until the ever-watchful door guard bursts in, and between ragged breaths delivers the tragic news that Arnegis's body has been found by the Brass Blades. Without a word, Drusilla departs for Erralig's Burial Chamber, leaving her family without a leader. It falls to you to follow, and remind her of the duty she owes to those who yet live."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB221_04076_SEQ_02","You find Drusilla at Erralig's Burial Chamber, where she demands the attendant priest allow her to see Arnegis's body. In the face of Drusilla's anger, he agrees to forgo custom─though upon viewing the remains of her comrade, she forbids you from doing the same. Her rage seemingly spent, the reaper explains that there is someone to whom she must speak before returning to headquarters. You are invited to accompany her to Stonesthrow, provided you do so in silence."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB221_04076_SEQ_03","In Stonesthrow, Drusilla performs the grim duty of informing Arnegis's wife of his death. Though the woman weeps for him, she speaks with no hint of reproach toward her husband's leader, asking only that he be avenged. Before returning to headquarters, Drusilla requests a word with you out of sight of prying eyes."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB221_04076_SEQ_04","Drusilla apologizes for not divulging her prior history with Orcus from the start, and reiterates her commitment to seeing him utterly destroyed. As you express the same, you feel a shiver run down your spine, and turn to see a man with pale skin and sanguine eyes─Orcus himself. Drusilla seizes the opportunity to strike, but Orcus dodges her blow with ease, before fixing you with a ravenous gaze. The slavering fiend describes your soul in uncomfortable detail, proclaiming it the most delicious he has ever seen. Upon declaring his intent to see it suffused with terror and hatred ere he returns to feast, the voidsent vanishes, leaving you and Drusilla alone on the bridge."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB221_04076_SEQ_05","Drusilla curses herself for failing to deal Orcus a killing blow then and there. Regaining her composure, she bids you return to Lemures headquarters to discuss your next move.

※In the event that you leave Lemures headquarters, you may re-enter by speaking with the Lemures member in Pearl Lane."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBB221_04076_SEQ_06","In the safety of Lemures headquarters, Drusilla confirms Orcus's words: the voidsent who covets your soul inhabits the body of Drusilla's grandfather, rendered youthful through dark arts. The reaper further explains that Orcus feasts on the souls of those that he kills, absorbing their aether to sate his endless appetite. Although Drusilla in unsure how to proceed, she warns you to take special care as you go about your affairs, for Orcus may be lurking around any corner.

※The next reaper quest will be available from Drusilla upon reaching level 78."
