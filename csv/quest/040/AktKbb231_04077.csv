1,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_01","While pleased to see you safe, Drusilla informs you that members of the family throughout Thanalan have reported disturbing sightings. That, along with a blunted dagger delivered to Lemures headquarters as a threat, has put everyone on edge. She suggests investigating the claims, both to gather potentially useful information and to escape from her quarters for a spell. You are to speak with family at Black Brush Station, from where one of the reports originated."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_02","Though the first of the Lemures you approach has witnessed nothing unusual of late, he speaks at length and shares the story of his exile from Garlemald. He also tells you of a young woman who claims to have seen frightening images in the sands, and instructs you to visit Lost Hope if you wish to hear her delusions."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_03","The woman is much more level-headed than you were led to believe, but still shaken by her recent experiences. After you introduce yourself as a friend of Drusilla, she regales you with the tale of how she and her beloved fled Garlemald, displaying an eagerness to divulge personal details that appears oddly common amongst the Lemures. She then informs you that it was not her, but her beloved who spied the dread figure in the desert, and begs you to ask him for further details─and, if you are able, bring an end to the vile menace."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_04","You interrupt a slender man engaged in the sacred act of poetic creation. Whether it is because the verses he recites are divine or dreadful is unclear, but regardless, a voidsent reveals itself as the final rhyme is released unto the desert wind. The poet is helpless before the otherworldly beast, leaving the butchery in your hands."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_05","You dispatch the threat, which refrains from giving its opinion on the poet's latest masterpiece. The flustered artist appears unharmed and regards you in stunned awe. Perhaps the sound of your voice will awaken him from his stupor─or failing that, a powerful nod."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_06","The man thanks you profusely before reporting that it was during a similar excursion into the desert that he saw the man with pale skin and blood red eyes. The enigmatic figure returned his gaze with unnerving silence and an ominous grin before vanishing. While it is uncertain if this was Orcus or not, the poet recognizes that the desert is no place for feats of lyricism, and returns to the uncritical arms of his beloved, marking the end of your duty there."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_07","Drusilla listens to your story with concern and praises you for slaying the voidsent before anyone came to harm. She then asks for your thoughts on the disparate members of the Lemures before speaking of how all fled their homeland of Garlemald. She goes on to recount her own experiences at length, telling the story of her grandfather Rullus's failed assassination of Solus zos Galvus, and his subsequent pursuit of power that led to his possession by Orcus and her flight to Eorzea. While the memories are plainly not easy for her to recall, her willingness to share is proof that she has come to think of you as a member of her found family. Tired from the day's work, she bids you return to headquarters. 

※You may re-enter Lemures headquarters by speaking with the loyal Lemure in Pearl Lane."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_08","Although Orcus did not show himself during your investigations into the family's claims, Drusilla seems certain that he will act soon─and that she will be his chosen target. No sooner does she share this intuition than Orcus appears, scythe poised to remove her head from her shoulders. Though titillated by the hatred and fear he sees smoldering within you, he yearns to see his meal grow even more flavorful, and to that end declares that he will torture Drusilla at his leisure, all the while waiting for your soul to attain its full delicious potential. With those parting words, Orcus returns to the shadows whence he came, leaving you and Hermin alone in Drusilla's chambers. The gobsmacked girl looks as if she could use some comforting words, or perhaps an outlet for her rising anger."
9,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_SEQ_09","After Hermin's rage subsides, your next course of action becomes clear: rescue Drusilla from Orcus's clutches at all costs. His whereabouts are as uncertain as ever, but Hermin plans on pooling the resources of the family to make a concerted effort to ascertain them. In the meantime, you must keep your skills sharp, for only a reaper can cut Orcus down.

※The next reaper quest will be available from Hermin upon reaching level 80."

132,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_ORCUS_000_152","I was right not to give in to my baser instincts. To allow the thought of your taste to simmer in my mind as you and Drusilla formed a bond, a...kinship, even?"

134,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_ORCUS_000_154","Hmm... But perhaps I should wait a while longer. To let the flavor of your hatred mature and the tang of your malice ripen."
135,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_ORCUS_000_155","I can make use of Drusilla yet. Revel in her screams, exult in her misery. Ahh, how splendid it will be!"

145,"TEXT_AKTKBB231_04077_HERMIN_000_164","Right. We need a plan. First things first: find out where Orcus is hiding. The rest of the family should be able to help with that."
