50,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_011","Now, I've been pondering the ways in which I might contribute to the rebuilding effort. While I don't have many talents─not outside of those considered normal for a dwarf such as drinking, at any rate─people do say that I have the gift of the gab."
51,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_012","Using this gift, I've a mind to peddle wares in the outside world to earn coin to put towards our work. There's just one problem: at the moment, we don't have anything that would fetch a halfway decent price."
52,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_013","No, we need something more unusual and exotic than our grog and automata. And as I racked my beard for ideas, it came to me: what could be more unusual and exotic than objects from another world?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_014","The machines have a base inside the crater, and I understand it's brimming with all manner of their paraphernalia. Such items are guaranteed to fetch a high price─we just need someone to venture in to retrieve them: you!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_A1_000_001","If you're not fussed about what I bring back..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_A1_000_002","I'm not sure if they'd be worth <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> much..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_016","As long as it's unusual, I'm confident I can spin a sales pitch for it. Oh yes, the coinbags of Eulmore would trip over themselves for such rare curios."
58,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_017","So just bring back the items, and leave the rest to me. Our coffers will be full before you know it!"
59,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_020","How fares the search in the crater? Remember, I'm not fussed about what you bring back as long as it's unusual."
60,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_100","Back from the crater, are you? Come, come, show me what you were able to find."
61,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_101","Oho, strange and wonderous items, all! I'll examine everything closely before I attempt to peddle them, but these ought to be snapped up with nary a fuss."
62,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_102","My thanks for bringing these. Now I can do my little part for our village."
63,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_103","Ah, and before I forget, the chief was asking for you earlier. If you have a moment, do go and see what he wants."

68,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_100_161","The items you brought back last time are perfect, but I'm hoping to have more stock before I head to Eulmore to do my peddling."
69,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_161","Could I trouble you to go on another foray into the crater?"
70,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_165","With just a few more items from the crater, I'll have enough stock to make it worth setting out to do my peddling. My thanks in advance."
71,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_250","There you are. Were you able to find anything else of interest?"
72,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_251","Marvelous! With the addition of this little lot, I'm now ready to set forth!"
73,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_252","If truth be told, I'm a little daunted by the prospect of going all the way to Eulmore. But if I have confidence in myself─and some grog is always good for that─I'm sure that all will be well."
74,"TEXT_LUCKTA522_04051_VILLAGERB03954_000_253","Oh yes, I'll see to it our wares fetch the best coin they can, and prove to everyone that I'm worth more than the ale I can hold."
