1,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_01","As Cerigg tells it, the child who you rescued from the hollow is resting safely in Mord Souq, but there is a rub: the boy seemingly remembers nothing save his name─Taynor. Cerigg sent him for a stroll around town to see if it might help to jog his memories, and encourages you to check in on him. Track down Taynor and see if he has met with any success in piecing together his past."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_02","You and Cerigg speak further with Taynor, who unfortunately can still recall nothing of where he came from. Cerigg further explains that according to the carer who examined him, the boy apparently possesses considerable magical powers. Drawing the conclusion that he doubtless has a master or tutor somewhere out there, the bounty hunter proposes speaking with a traveling merchant in town to see if anything might be gleaned as to your young friend's origins."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_03","The merchant tells of something he overheard when sojourning at the Inn at Journey's Head─that of an ill-fated mage who was attacked by a sin eater and was separated from his child in the process. Believing that this could very well be Taynor's father, the three of you resolve to make for the Inn and investigate further."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_04","You arrive at the Inn to learn that the son of the wounded mage has already been found─the man was not Taynor's father after all. The kindly boy offers to show Taynor around the premises in hopes of further rekindling his memories. Once the boy is gone, Cerigg, dismayed at the unfortunate turn of events, proposes entrusting Taynor to the care of another so that the two of you might return to hunting Phronesis─and continue the search for Taynor's family in the process. Cerigg offers to break the news to the unfortunate child himself, and you agree to accompany him."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_05","Events have taken yet another distressing turn, as Taynor is nowhere to be found. As it happens, your young charge got into a heated quarrel with the other boy, and subsequently dashed off on his own to the gods know where. Together with Cerigg, you make for the Fields of Amber, that you might track down Taynor before he comes to harm."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_06","Arriving in the Fields of Amber, you find Taynor under attack by nasty-looking sin eaters. Vanquish the fiends before they devour the poor, frightened child."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_07","You successfully dispatch the sin eaters and rescue Taynor from harm. In the aftermath of the battle, you are granted a vision of Taynor's past through the power of the Echo. There, you see that the boy was a young mage training under the same teacher as Nyelbert, one of the erstwhile Warriors of Light who now roams the area as the baleful Phronesis. Understandably perplexed by these recent developments, Cerigg proposes a return to the Inn at Journey's Head, where you might discuss matters further in safer environs."
8,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_08","Back at the Inn, Taynor and the other boy apologize to each other and make their peace, and the latter departs for his new home at the Crystarium. The remaining three of you make plans to return to Mord Souq, where you might think over the knowledge you have recently gleaned and unravel the mysteries behind the enigmatic child's past."
9,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_SEQ_09","Back at Mord Souq, Cerigg explains to Taynor that, as bizarre as it may sound, the events of his memory must have taken place over one hundred years ago. Convinced now that your young companion is the key to vanquishing the dread Phronesis, Cerigg has a change of heart and proposes that the two of you officially take him in. Taynor welcomes the offer, thanking the two of you profusely for your kindness and promising that he will lend you whatever aid he can. For your part, you resolve to further hone your command of the magical arts while waiting for the lad's memories to recover further.

※The next role quest will be available from Cerigg upon reaching level 76 in any magical ranged DPS class."

49,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_001","There's just one rub, you see. He has no recollection of where he came from, or just how he managed to get swallowed up into the void."
50,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_002","In fact, other than his own name─Taynor─he can't remember much of anything at all."
51,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_003","He seems a good lad, mind you─eats my half-arsed cooking with a smile and nary a word of complaint. Yet I reckon he's hurting inside, and badly. We must reunite him with his parents with all due speed."
52,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_004","I suggested that he go for a stroll around Mord Souq, in the hopes that the sights might help to jog his memories. He can't have wandered far─why don't you go check up on him?"

54,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_020","Do not tell me...you are the one who rescued me from the flow, yes? I feel from you the same warmth that reached out to me when I was adrift in the aether."
55,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_021","Well, I'll be damned. The boy's a sharp one."
56,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_022","And that's not the least of it. The carer who examined him said they could feel great power welling up from within him. Despite his young age, Taynor here seems to possess a remarkable command of the magical arts."

58,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_025","No need for apologies, boy. You did well just to make it back to us. Speaking of which, can you remember anything at all of what you felt when you were adrift in the void?"
59,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_026","That I remember...or at least I think I do. I recall a vague sensation of someone passing alongside me. Indeed, I believe this is what roused me from my slumber."
60,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_027","Hmm... If the hollows truly are a gate between worlds, that would mean that someone recently traveled from ours to another─or from another to ours... But that's not possible...or is it?"

67,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_041","You'd truly do that? For me? But the two of you have already saved my life. I couldn't possibly burden you any further..."
68,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_042","Hah, it's no burden at all! Besides, if we can figure out just who you are─and where you came from─it just might lead us to the answers we seek."
69,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_043","Now, let's consider the options. One possibility is that you're an orphan─all alone in this world, with not a soul to care for or look after you."
70,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_044","And yet, this seems unlikely. Yes, the mystical powers you possess say otherwise. If you are truly as skilled in magic as they say, then it stands to reason that someone trained you in the art."
71,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_045","Who this master of yours is─and whether you are of their blood, or simply received their tutelage─this I cannot say. But either way, I'm certain they're worried sick about you."

73,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_047","That settles it, then─let's get down to business. I took the liberty of inquiring around Mord Souq and the Crystarium. Unfortunately, there have been no reports of missing persons matching Taynor's description."
74,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_048","Which means that we have no choice but to take our search elsewhere. I know of a merchant in town whose travels often take him far afield. Let us have a talk with him and see if he's heard any helpful rumors."
75,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_060","Impressive how Taynor's managed to keep himself together, eh? The boy's mature beyond his years, no doubt."
76,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_065","The two of you are far too kind. I cannot thank you enough..."
77,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TRAVELINGMERCHANT03625_000_080","Rumors of a missing boy, you say? Funny that you ask. It's a long shot, I reckon, but I overheard something the other day that might be of use."
78,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TRAVELINGMERCHANT03625_000_081","On my way to Mord Souq, I stopped over at the Inn at Journey's Head. There, I met an ailing mage. As the carers told it, he'd been ambushed by a sin eater, and was separated from his child in the battle."
79,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_082","Bloody hells...could it be!? If the sin eater that attacked the poor man was Phronesis, that would explain everything!"
80,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_083","This man you speak of...he could be my father? We must go to him at once!"
81,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_084","Agreed. I only hope that the man is...no, there is no point in presuming the worst. Let us make for the Inn, and see what the carers there can tell us."
82,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TRAVELINGMERCHANT03625_000_090","The man was in rough shape, I fear. For the child's sake, I hope he's doing better than when I last saw him..."
83,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_095","I just hope whatever we find here puts a smile on the poor boy's face."

92,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_127","Indeed it's not. Guess that means either myself or <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here should accompany him..."

101,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_136","If the lad tags along with us every step of the way, he's far more likely to end up dead or worse than to ever reunite with his family."

141,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_245","I knew that you two would work things out. Now, let us return to Mord Souq. We have more than our share of questions that need answering."
142,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_260","I cannot help but feel I also made a promise to that boy in my memories... Nyelbert, was it?"
143,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_280","As I saw it, first you fainted all of a sudden. When you came to, a portion of Taynor's memories had returned. What in the world happened out there?"
144,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_290","The power to look into the past, eh?"
145,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_100_290","And you're certain that what <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> described matches up with your recollection of the past?"
146,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_291","I don't know how to break this to you, lad, but...your friend Nyelbert that was with you that day? He's no ordinary boy."
147,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_292","He's none other than the very man who became Phronesis─one of those godsdamned Warriors of Light. If he was just a young child in your memories, that means that what you saw took place over one hundred years ago!"
148,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_293","Would that it were just a coincidence─another boy with the same name. But no, judging from the formidable command of magic...we can only assume it was him."
149,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_294","On the way back, I managed to recall some more...about Nyelbert and myself."
150,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_295","We were taken in by a group of mages...a consortium of sorts. They were searching for a means to open a hole to another world, and were recruiting young children with high magical aptitude for the task. Nyelbert and myself were the two they chose..."
151,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_296","You can't be serious! And yet, that would explain the sin eater's ability to summon those damned hollows..."
152,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_297","And if you possess the same knowledge and training as Nyelbert did, it could also explain why you were able to survive in there all that time. But what I don't understand is...why haven't you aged at all?"
153,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_298","I cannot say for sure. And yet my memories...they are slowly coming back to me. In time, I may be able to help you find a way to close the hollows."
154,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_299","You'd be a lifesaver if you could. But don't overburden yourself─you're still recovering, after all. In the meantime, don't worry: <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and I will see that you're safe."
155,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_300","I'd thought Taynor was just a victim of the sin eater. To think he was actually <Emphasis>friends</Emphasis> with the man himself...er, back when he was still a man. This can't be simple coincidence."
156,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_301","Yes, I'm convinced of it now─the child holds the key to defeating Phronesis. We must keep him safe, and not let him out of our sights."
157,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_100_301","Besides, look at how hard he's trying to recover his memories. I'm not so heartless as to kick the poor lad aside before he's figured matters out."
158,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_302","But we can't very well rush things. You and I will continue to prepare for the battle ahead, while waiting for the rest of Taynor's memories to come back to him..."
159,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_100_302","Ah, that is to say...if it's all right with you, lad?"
160,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_TAYNOR_000_303","I...I'm so sorry. I couldn't possibly burden you any further..."
161,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_304","Look, lad. I've only known you a short while, but I can tell you've a good heart, and a good head on your shoulders."
162,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_305","I can only begin to imagine the horrors you've been through, not to mention the fears and uncertainty you face even now."
163,"TEXT_LUCKBA421_03625_CERIGG_000_306","But I want you to promise me this: no more apologies. You're no burden to us, not in the least. You're a valuable member of our band, and as long as you're willing, I want you with us. Isn't that right, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
