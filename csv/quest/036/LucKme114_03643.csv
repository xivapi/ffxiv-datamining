1,"TEXT_LUCKME114_03643_SEQ_01","Chai-Nuzz informs you everything is in place, and that the Talos is ready to be awakened. Only the imbuing remains to be done, after which the enormous golem will rise to take Mt. Gulg in its grasp─assuming all goes according to plan. Once the process is set in motion, there will be no turning back, so the Exarch bids you see to your battle preparations, that he might then give the order to begin."
2,"TEXT_LUCKME114_03643_SEQ_02","As all present hold their collective breaths, the Talos wakes to life and proceeds to reach out for the volcano. Excitement quickly gives way to dismay, however, as the sin eaters guarding Vauthry's domain converge upon the golem's vulnerable hands, threatening to end your mission before it has begun. For a blessing, help then arrives in the unexpected form of the fae folk, who engage the sin eaters from the air and allow the Talos to safely complete its task. With the route to Vauthry thus secured, you make haste to join your fellow Scions at the foot of Mt. Gulg."
3,"TEXT_LUCKME114_03643_SEQ_03","Your comrades all know their purpose, and there is no further need for words. In silence, you set forth for the grueling climb that will see you traverse the Talos's stony body on your way to Vauthry's newly built paradise.

※In the event that you leave the instance, you may proceed to the Crown of the Immaculate by speaking with the sentry at the foot of Mt. Gulg."

※The Crown of the Immaculate can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
6,"TEXT_LUCKME114_03643_SEQ_06","At the end of a furious encounter, you succeed in laying low Vauthry's ultimate incarnation, Innocence. Their own foes having fled, your comrades join you just in time to witness your broken adversary's final moments.

※In the event that you leave the instance, you may proceed to the Crown of the Immaculate by speaking with the sentry at the foot of Mt. Gulg."
7,"TEXT_LUCKME114_03643_SEQ_07","Succumbing to his wounds at last, Vauthry's body dissolves into innumerable motes of light, which you stoically take unto yourself. At that instant, the blazing shroud covering the firmament falls away to reveal a peaceful night sky. You do not have a chance to relish the sight, however, as you find yourself pulled into a vision of Vauthry's past, when he was but a babe in the womb. He too, you discover, was a pawn of the Ascians, born as man and sin eater both to bring about the First's Rejoining.

Even as the vision fades, your entire being is racked by pain. What all had feared is coming to pass─you are unable to contain the combined power of all the Wardens. In that moment, the Crystal Exarch arrives, his true plan finally revealed. From the beginning, it was his intent to take your unbearable burden upon himself, and teleport into the rift in a final act of sacrifice. But before he can complete his ritual, a shot rings out and he crumples to the floor. Holding the smoking gun is none other than Emet-Selch, come to prevent his painstakingly amassed Light from being spirited away. Declaring you unworthy to be his ally, the Ascian leaves with the wounded Exarch, though not before inviting you to seek him out at his abode, in the dark depths of the Tempest.

Some time later, you awaken in your chambers with Ardbert watching over you. Your spectral companion duly explains the events that took place after you lost consciousness. You learn it is only thanks to Ryne's powers that you have not yet turned into a sin eater, but that it is only a matter of time. Bile rising in your throat, you throw open the window...and look out upon a land shrouded in Light once more─all of your efforts having come to naught. Seeing your despair, Ardbert urges you to get some fresh air outside the confines of your room.

※The next main scenario quest will be available from the manager of suites in the Pendants."
