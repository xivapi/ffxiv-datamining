52,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_020","Though the Talos yet wants for a beating heart, it would appear thine efforts were not for naught."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_JERYK_000_030","Right, then. The Talos...their hearts cannot be made of just any stone. You need a special sort with sufficient aetherial conductivity. Both it and the other materials used in the construction of Talos bodies are mined in the same place..."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_JERYK_000_031","That place, of course, being here. The Hills of Amber..."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_JERYK_000_032","And it was three years ago when...when she..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_JERYK_000_033","No, no I can't. I'm sorry, but you'll have to hear it from Thaffe or someone else."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THANCRED_000_034","<sigh> Back to the tavern, then."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THANCRED_000_040","You don't suppose Thaffe is going to run off too, do you?"
59,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_RYNE_000_045","This is all my fault. I never should have pressured him."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_050","What terrible tragedy befell him years ago, I wonder..."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_060","Still here, eh? You can ask again, but the answer's the same. Our trolleys are─"
62,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_061","What!? Godsdammit Jeryk. You could've at least finished so I wouldn't have to clean up your mess."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_062","Seeing how you made such quick progress in fixing that Talos and all, he was probably thinking you could help change things around here."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_063","And I think he may be right... Gather your friends, and I'll tell you what you want to know."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_RYNE_000_070","Why must he always treat me like this..."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_MAGNUS_000_075","If not for those damned Talos, she'd...she'd..."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_080","I wish there was more we could do for you, I truly do. But after Agna's accident, no one is allowed near those mines."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_090","Full well do I know the pain of loss and how heavily it can weigh on one's heart. Nevertheless, there is but one way forward."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_091","We must needs procure a new heart for the Talos."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_092","Thaffe. Knowest thou any location wherein we might find the stone we require? No matter how scant the possibility, we would seize it."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_093","I told you near all of the veins were tapped dry years ago. ...Though I suppose, if you really wanted to try, you may find something at Nuvy's Leavings."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_094","It was opened well before Talos became commonplace, which is why the mining there was never quite as deep."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_095","When you get there, look for Guthjon and tell him I sent you. But don't be surprised if he tells you the same thing."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_096","Thine assistance is most appreciated."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_097","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I think it best Thancred join thee in this search."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_098","Though he wouldst be quick to deny it, his heart is in turmoil, and his thoughts clouded."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_099","'Twould be unwise to ignore his distress."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_URIANGER_000_110","I prithee attend Thancred and keep him occupied with the task at hand."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THAFFE_000_115","Guthjon has worked in these mines longer than near anyone I know. You'd do well to heed his advice in there."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THANCRED_000_120","Off to somewhere, are you?"
81,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THANCRED_000_121","At last, a lead on the stone we need to power the Talos."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMD110_03615_THANCRED_000_122","I can't very well have you go on your own. Lead the way."
