1,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_01","Thancred bids you make your way to the Ocular while he and Minfilia gather the remaining Scions for the coming meeting. As you turn to depart, he reminds you to deliver the soldier's message of support to the Exarch─something that is probably better done in private, before the others arrive."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_02","However hard he tries to conceal it, the Exarch is plainly burdened by the sacrifices made in the name of restoring balance to the First. Be that as it may, his conviction shows no sign of wavering, and he seems heartened by your show of solidarity. Once Thancred and the others arrive, you set about discussing Vauthry's recent threat, the Exarch sharing what he suspects of the man: namely, that he may have control not only over the sin eaters, but the people of Eulmore as well. Though all are agreed that destroying the Lightwardens remains the most expedient method of fighting back, it seems that little progress has been made in finding them. When no other options present themselves, Minfilia suggests that you travel to Amh Araeng, where she may become one with the Oracle of Light, thereby acquiring the power to locate your quarry. Thancred is not best pleased by this prospect, but has no choice but to concede defeat in the face of Minfilia's determination."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_03","Sensing your concern, Minfilia reaffirms her commitment to her chosen course of action, and asks that you trust her judgment with an earnestness worthy of her namesake. She then departs─presumably to make her preparations before joining Thancred at the gates."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_04","After a short wait, Minfilia arrives at the appointed place and declares her readiness to depart. But before proceeding, you give her one last opportunity to abandon her chosen course. Her emphatic reply leaves little room for argument, however, so the group turns its attention to the question of how best to pass through Amh Araeng unnoticed. At Alisaie's suggestion, you decide to split up─sending her, Alphinaud, and Y'shtola to the east to distract the Eulmoran Army while the rest of you take the western route to Nabaath Areng."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_05","As you near the gate to Amh Araeng, you realize you are not the only one contemplating the ordeals that may lie ahead. Hearing Thancred's quiet plea for assistance in protecting Minfilia, his trepidation could not be more obvious."
6,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_06","You speak with Hardyss, who grants you passage through the gate─perhaps against her better judgment."
7,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_07","Vibrant violet gives way to dry red and orange as you, Urianger, Thancred, and Minfilia pass through the gate and proceed into the Hills of Amber. Taking in the dusty and precipitous landscape, your eyes fall upon what appears to be a village nearby, and the party pauses for a moment to prepare for whatsoever may come."
8,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_SEQ_08","As Minfilia looks out over the valley before you, you see newfound purpose in her eyes. Whatever doubts she may harbor, it is plain she is pleased to be in control of her own destiny at long last."

113,"TEXT_LUCKMD104_03609_ALPHINAUD_000_113","Hm. I cannot deny that it's a sound plan─but nor can I allow you to go alone. My skills will make your task at least somewhat easier, will they not?"
