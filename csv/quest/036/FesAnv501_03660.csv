※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_01","An overworked and under-rested P'obyano has her hands full cleaning up after a revelrous Moonfire Faire, and your fortuitous arrival has afforded her the perfect opportunity to delegate one of the more menial tasks. Taking pity on the girl, you agree to assist in picking up various pieces of rubbish and refuse that have been unceremoniously dumped on the sparkling sands of Bloodshore. P'obyano thanks you for your offer of aid, and bids you return whatever you may find to her so that she might see it disposed of properly.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_02","Thanks to your efforts, the beaches of Bloodshore are no longer blighted by the unsightly presence of empty bottles and assorted pieces of trash and refuse. Deliver the fruits of your labor to P'obyano, so that your inventory, too, might similarly be free of worthless junk."
3,"TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_03","P'obyano duly thanks you for your efforts and takes the rubbish you found on the beach into her possession, when her curiosity is immediately piqued by the presence of a bottle containing a message. She promptly extracts and reads the largely illegible missive, which appears to be writ with a grim prophecy. Concerned that another calamity may be impending, P'obyano pleads with you to deliver the letter to her friend Bran in Limsa Lominsa, a reporter for the <Emphasis>Harbor Herald</Emphasis> who specializes in such matters."
4,"TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_04","You present the mysterious missive to Bran, who immediately identifies the letter as having been penned by none other than a certain wandering minstrel of some renown, and the words themselves as having been excerpted from the seventh verse of Mezaya Thousand Eyes's <Emphasis>Divine Chronicles</Emphasis>. At a loss for what this all means, the veteran gazetteer proposes that the two of you pay a visit to the enigmatic musician in Ul'dah and question him to see what information you might glean."
5,"TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_05","Arriving in Ul'dah, you and Bran quickly locate the minstrel, who genially acquiesces to your request for an interview─provided it is conducted on his terms─and proceeds to enlighten you as to the nature of the letter. As he tells it, it actually dates back to before the Calamity, when the minstrel and his adventurer friends were endeavoring to spread the word about the impending destruction far and wide across the land. As for why it has found its way to you years later, however, he cannot say. Moved to song, he begins to play an ode on his harp, but the song has only begun when you are whisked away to a curious pocket of time and space. There, you are greeted by a man bearing an uncanny resemblance to the minstrel, who introduces himself by the unusual name of “Naoki Yoshida.” He thanks you for the countless heroic deeds you have performed in Eorzea, and shares with you his own feelings of deep fondness for the realm you call home. Leaving you with a cryptic message suggesting that his unseen companions also wish to share words of gratitude with you by other means, he bids you farewell. In the next moment, you find yourself regaining your senses beside Bran and the minstrel, who has just finished what─judging from Bran's reaction─appears to have been a truly memorable performance. After the reporter rushes from the scene to begin penning his latest and greatest story, you share a reflective moment with the minstrel as you watch a spectacular fireworks display in the heavens above the sultanate. Your work done for today, you set out for Bloodshore to share news of all that has happened with P'obyano."
6,"TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_06","Back at Bloodshore, P'obyano is relieved to hear that the ominous letter is years old, and that no Calamity or catastrophe is impending. She then explains that, in a rather curious development, more and more message bottles have been washing up on the shore ever since you left. Should you be curious as to the contents, you are free to assist her in retrieving them, a job for which she would be happy to compensate you with tokens exchangeable for a host of seasonal specialties."
