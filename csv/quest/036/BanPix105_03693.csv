49,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_001","You see, I've asked a Nu Mou crafter to craft me a delightful new toy to bring to the children in their dreams, and I promised I'd repay them with something very, very special─an echevore tail, to be precise!"
50,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_002","Have you ever seen an echevore tail? You can smell them or sip from them, and they have the taste and aroma of sweet, sweet honey! A bit <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> sweet for my liking, to tell the truth, but the Nu Mou just can't seem to get enough of them."
51,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_003","But there's a bit of a rub. The sweetest of the sweet echevores can only be found distressingly close to the stamping grounds of those oh-so-nasty Fuath.

52,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_004","Hmph! As penance, I demand that you go forth and fetch the echevore tail that I seek! And if you see any Fuath along the way, feel free to smack them in their smarmy faces with those stupid little hats of theirs!"
53,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_010","<sniff> Is that sweet, sweet honey I smell? I knew you wouldn't come back empty-handed! Well, hand it over then, already!"
54,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_011","Why, I say, this is the sweetest aroma I've ever had the pleasure of smelling! Perhaps those Nu Mou <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know what they're talking about. Perhaps they won't mind if I take just a teeny-tiny smidgen..."
55,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_012","Ahem! Which is to say, of <Emphasis>course</Emphasis> I'm not thinking of taking a sip! We pixies have <Emphasis>far</Emphasis> more refined palates than those silly Nu Mou. We're not ones to sit around all day sucking on these icky tails!"
56,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_013","At any rate, thank you as always for being so subser─er, helpful! So helpful! Please come back again soon! Now, just a tiny little... Hmm? You're still here?"
