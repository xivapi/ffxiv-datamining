1,"TEXT_LUCKYB005_03601_SEQ_01","In the wake of the many changes come to the city of Eulmore, several military leaders have taken it upon themselves to resurrect an ancient training method to mold a new generation of peacekeepers. You too may benefit from taking part in this endeavor, though you will have to speak with the soft-faced bloke outside the city to learn more first."
2,"TEXT_LUCKYB005_03601_SEQ_02","To your considerable surprise, the new training grounds are a near replica of those found on the Source. Quite how such an extraordinary coincidence could be possible is hard to fathom, but regardless, the resilient training dummies are at your disposal should you wish to hone your skills."

50,"TEXT_LUCKYB005_03601_EULMORRANPEOPLE03601_000_002","Say what you will about the bastards, but they kept the city safe, or near as much. The remaining leadership-types have got their work cut out for them keeping everyone fighting fit, but for a start, there's been talk of bringing back traditional training methods."
51,"TEXT_LUCKYB005_03601_EULMORRANPEOPLE03601_000_003","I'm talking about stuff what could be used to get unbloodied layabouts like me ready to take the field. Of course, there's also plenty of military men taking part, eager to hone their skills for the struggles ahead."

55,"TEXT_LUCKYB005_03601_TRAVELLER03601_000_011","In case it's not bloody obvious, we're all of us struggling to adapt to the new normal. When you wake up one day and realize half the life decisions you made weren't your own, it's hard to adjust."

57,"TEXT_LUCKYB005_03601_TRAVELLER03601_000_013","Anyway, it's all very much a work in progress─and one we're hoping warriors like you can help us with, even if only by taking part as a guest. Draw attention to what we're trying to get off the ground, you know?"

61,"TEXT_LUCKYB005_03601_TRAVELLER03601_000_018","Eerie coincidences notwithstanding, if you'd like to hone your warcraft, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better option than unleashing everything you've got on one of our contraptions."
