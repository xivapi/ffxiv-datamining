118,"TEXT_LUCKMD108_03613_JERYK_000_132","When they left, the life began to bleed out of the town. The trolley's tracks rusted, and its cars fell into disrepair. Now, I was born in Twine, raised there─my first word was “trolley,” dammit─and those were the worst years of my life."
119,"TEXT_LUCKMD108_03613_JERYK_000_133","But then, about seven years past, Magnus and his wife returned to us."
120,"TEXT_LUCKMD108_03613_JERYK_000_134","Magnus is a real, proper trolley engineer, and perhaps he would never have left in the first place─if it hadn't been for his son. As you're well aware, Amh Araeng is hardly the safest place, and Magnus wanted his child to grow up away from its dangers."
121,"TEXT_LUCKMD108_03613_JERYK_000_135","It didn't help, in the end. The sin eaters got the boy. Isn't that always the way?"

125,"TEXT_LUCKMD108_03613_JERYK_000_141","And now you know the story of the trolley. Won't do you much good without the Talos, though."
