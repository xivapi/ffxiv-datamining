49,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_001","Fascinating...and precisely the sort of information I was hoping to hear."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_002","In fact, if you have a moment, I'd like to borrow your eyes to confirm a theory I've been working on. Come."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_010","Now, there are two tasks I would have you perform."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_011","The first requires you to inspect the buildings which surround the Ondo settlement, and note their most distinctive characteristics."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_012","For the second, I wish you to use this knife to take scrapings from one of the remnant walls."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_013","Pray be as thorough as you can. I shall be waiting here for the results of your investigations."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_020","'Tis strange to be here, under the ocean. It seems a lifetime ago that we stood amidst the trees of Rak'tika..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_SYSTEM_000_030","Inspect the structures of the Ondo Cups for distinctive features. You may move the camera, as well as zoom in and out.

57,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_SYSTEM_000_040","You set the point of the knife against the wall, but even after applying considerable pressure, you cannot remove so much as a flake of stone."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_050","And what have you discovered?"
59,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_051","Yes, I would agree that the windows are most distinctive. 'Twould seem the structures appear the same to both your sight and mine..."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_052","And you say you could not so much as scratch the wall? Even with all your might behind the blade?"
61,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_053","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, everywhere I turn in this place, my gaze is drawn by peculiar materials for which I do not have a name."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_054","The buildings I had you investigate are prime examples. They may appear to be constructed of ordinary stone, but I assure you it is nothing of the sort..."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_055","If pressed, I would describe the substance as a composite of several mineral properties, blended to create a material of unparalleled durability."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_056","Even the Ronkan Empire, once the greatest power in Norvrandt, produced nothing which compares to this level of perfection."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_057","But if not the Ronkans, then who? Who were these ancients the Ondo claim as the architects of their sanctuary?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_058","I suspect our answer lies with the reason Emet-Selch withdrew here to the Tempest."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_059","He may simply have wished to retreat somewhere mere mortals would struggle to reach...but there are many such remote locations. Why here, specifically?"
68,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_060","Emet-Selch is devoted to his role, and thus we might assume his choice of stronghold somehow serves the Ascian agenda."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_061","Or mayhap...'tis a place more dear to him than any other."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"

72,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_A1_000_002","Could this place provide power to Emet-Selch?"
73,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_A1_000_003","I couldn't say either way..."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_062","That is my theory, that these structures are remnants of a time before history─of a star that was yet whole and unbroken."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_063","That was my first thought as well. Yet no matter how superior the materials, a ruin is just a ruin. 'Tis naught that would decide a battle's outcome."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_064","Which brings us to my second theory: that he has some other, more personal connection to this site. What if these structures are remnants of a time before history─of a star that was yet whole and unbroken?"

79,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_067","...A copy of the mural in the Qitana Ravel. Almet presented it to me during my visit to Fanow, after our victory in Kholusia."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_068","Here, in the first scene...
By Emet-Selch's own words, it depicts a city of eons past and the disaster which befell it."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_069","The design is much simplified, of course, but do you see the similarities between its towers and those you have just inspected?"
82,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_070","We are close to the truth, I feel. Let us search the surrounds for another tower─one which matches the picture near enough to remove all doubt."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_071","From what I have seen, naught more than sand and more sand lies to the east, and the south held no such structures. I suggest we try our luck further to the northwest."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_SYSTEM_000_072","You may view the Qitana Ravel mural at any time during this quest by using the relevant item in the <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Key Items<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> menu."

88,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_080","Aye... This is the mural writ large..."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_081","Though I cannot guess at its purpose, it must have been an imposing sight. How much of the tower's height lies hidden beneath the ground, I wonder..."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_082","Centuries of our history have settled upon such ruins. Countless layers of dust and sediment..."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_083","...An entire civilization, its existence forgotten by all except a handful of Ascians."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_084","And yet it did exist. They lived here, in this city..."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_085","But let us focus on what we've learned thus far. The Ondo chieftain spoke of mysteries stirring─of a land illuminated."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_086","Judging by his words, he believes this phenomenon related to the ancients' return."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_087","Thus can we surmise that what the Ondo saw shining in the abyss was, in all likelihood, yet another remnant of this age-old civilization."
96,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_088","And who else would “light the lanterns” as Ryne put it, than Emet-Selch himself? 'Tis almost certain he is there!"
97,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_090","But if we are to find this stronghold in a timely manner, it seems gaining the Ondo's trust remains our swiftest path forward."
98,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_091","I only hope our deeds are enough to win them over..."
