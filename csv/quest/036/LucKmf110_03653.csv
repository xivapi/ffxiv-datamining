52,"TEXT_LUCKMF110_03653_YSHTOLA_000_003","Ah, Urianger, if I may. What are your thoughts on the ancients' art of creation?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKMF110_03653_URIANGER_000_004","A fascinating discipline, indeed. Aught the mind can conceive may be rendered in reality─all that is required is a clear “concept” upon which to focus one's will."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMF110_03653_URIANGER_000_005","'Tis not dissimilar to the primal rites taught by the Ascians, wherein ritual ceremony breatheth life into figments of myth and legend."

58,"TEXT_LUCKMF110_03653_YSHTOLA_000_009","If we were to attempt the same, such spells would soon deplete our energies, and then seek to draw the balance from elsewhere─from a hoard of crystals, mayhap, or from the very land itself."

60,"TEXT_LUCKMF110_03653_ALISAIE_000_011","An interesting matter which no doubt bears further study. But despite all these revelations, I worry we are no closer to finding Emet-Selch."
