49,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_002","But it's not enough, is it? Don't deny it. Nay, you need to experience it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles! And they need it too, if not more─why else would those Eulmoran bastards offer bigger and bigger bounties?"
50,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_003","They're waiting for you to slip up, just once. To give them a spectacular death. But you won't go quietly, oh no─you'll bleed them for every last gil and then some!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_004","And soon you'll have the chance to do so on an entirely different scale. How, you ask? By slaying elite marks, that's how!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_005","They're like nothing you've ever faced before. Wild and unpredictable, possessed of surpassing strength and guile. Many are the men who have left to slay such fiends, never to return."
53,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_006","But their failures will only serve to season the dish that is your victory! The greater the risk, the greater the reward─extrinsic and intrinsic, no? Which is why you must speak with Xylle without further delay!"

64,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_XYLLE_000_059","I rather think you have only yourself to blame for that. After all, was it not you who encouraged him and the others to strike you down and claim leadership?"
