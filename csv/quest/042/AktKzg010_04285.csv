Hold on─ You seem...thinner somehow."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_001","Hmm... You have much in common with <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> but it's clear you're not one of us. A familiar perhaps?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_002","I suppose it's just like <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> to send one of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> minions to poke its nose into our affairs. But since you're here, instead of hanging around like a bad smell, why don't you make yourself useful?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_003","I want you to take this latest work of mine─a new variety of fruit─to my colleagues."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_004","In the meantime, I will be cultivating more specimens in the Cthonic Horns. Yes, you heard that correctly. Cultivating, not simply conjuring with creation magicks. Aye, the fruit I produce is a labor of love."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_005","Now that my newest masterpiece is close to completion, I would have my fellow researchers sample its delights. I wish to hear their impressions before I make the final adjustments."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_006","Unfortunately, for all their wisdom, I find them intolerable at the best of times, never mind when they are critiquing my work. For that reason, I would have you go in my stead. And be quick about it─lest the fruit spoil as a result of your dawdling."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_010","Yes? Is something the matter? I've already given you your instructions, and I'd prefer not to repeat myself. Now go."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERA04285_000_020","You are the familiar who arrived with Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus, yes? And what do we have here?"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERA04285_000_021","A new species of fruit, eh? Let us hope it tastes better than it looks."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERA04285_000_022","My word!"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERA04285_000_023","What an unusual flavor! Equal parts bitter, musty, and tart...and not entirely unpleasant. I am curious to know how such a thing was created."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERA04285_000_024","Grown from seed in the Cthonic Horns, you say? In my experience, leaving such things to nature leads to wildly varying results. To have bred such a specimen must've been incredibly time-consuming, not to mention inefficient."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERB04285_000_030","You wish to speak with me?"
62,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERB04285_000_031","My impressions? Very well."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERB04285_000_032","Good gracious, what...is this!?"
64,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERB04285_000_033","It's so outrageously bitter, something akin to a wave of icy cold has spread throughout my entire body!"
65,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERB04285_000_034","I certainly wouldn't eat this out of choice, but it could be made into medicine for staving off the heat in arid environments."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERC04285_000_040","Are you lost, little familiar?"
67,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERC04285_000_041","For me? Why yes, I should love to try a piece!"
68,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERC04285_000_042","Hmm..."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERC04285_000_043","I don't mean to be rude, but this falls somewhere between “rather foul” and “positively revolting.” It's so bitter, it's practically inedible."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_OBSERVERC04285_000_044","More important, however, is the question of whether this fruit would serve its intended function. If wild animals cannot bring themselves to eat it, the seeds will never be spread. I can't imagine this creation being approved in its current state."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_050","You are returned, minus three fruit samples, I presume?"
72,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_051","Is that so? Not one of them found it to their liking? They claimed my last attempt was too sweet, and now it's too bitter!? Honestly, the nerve of these so-called experts!"
73,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_052","As they shall soon learn, I am not so easily deterred."
74,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_053","For my next creation, I'll cross-pollinate sour and sweet varieties, and see what they have to say about <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>!"
75,"TEXT_AKTKZG010_04285_ELEGANCECREATOR04285_000_054","I'll show them it's these “wildly varying results” that come from adherence to natural processes that have the power to defy expectations! And as the familiar of Azem <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If>, I'm sure you can appreciate that!"
