49,"TEXT_AKTKZE010_04249_BRISKLYLOPORRIT04249_000_001","Four of my friends went out to patrol the moon and mine for ore. They should be back by now, but... Well, I'm worried something happened!"

51,"TEXT_AKTKZE010_04249_BRISKLYLOPORRIT04249_000_004","Thank you! Let's hop to it, then. My friends were headed toward the Chlorophosgrot."

56,"TEXT_AKTKZE010_04249_DIZZYLOPORRIT04249_000_013","The others are either there in the Chlorophosgrot or near the Cradle of Darkness... I'm sure they're fine, though. They're nowhere near as, uh...exhausted...as I am."
