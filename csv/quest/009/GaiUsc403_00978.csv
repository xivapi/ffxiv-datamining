1,"TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_SEQ_01","Y'shtola states that before a rescue plan can be devised, the Scions must first gather intelligence on the stronghold of Castrum Centri. With this in mind, she suggests traveling to the Observatorium in Coerthas, and there petitioning Lord Portelaine for aid."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_SEQ_02","Lord Portelaine confirms that four prisoners matching the descriptions of Minfilia, Urianger, Papalymo, and Tataru were observed being led into Castrum Centri. Furthermore, he informs you that two men─likely Biggs and Wedge─escaped from a downed imperial airship not long ago. After a brief discussion, Y'shtola decrees that the Scions will immediately begin searching for the missing engineers, conscious that the Garleans are not like to spare their lives a second time."
