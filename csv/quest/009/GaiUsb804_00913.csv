1,"TEXT_GAIUSB804_00913_SEQ_01","Ser Aurelle has a mind to discreetly present Lord Haurchefant with a gift, for the great debt of Lord Francel's life and the honor of House Haillenarte. Speak with Emanuel and collect a bottle of Daniffen's Joy."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB804_00913_SEQ_02","Emanuel entrusts you with a rare liquor of Ser Aurelle's choosing. Resist the fleeting urge to down the entire bottle and deliver it to Medguistl, a member of Haurchefant's household."
