1,"TEXT_GAIUSB708_00903_SEQ_01","A wagon contracted by House Fortemps is apparently stalled somewhere on the east road. With Belmont and other sellswords busy with other sundry tasks, it falls to you to locate the wagon."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB708_00903_SEQ_02","You discover the wagon on its side and the occupants dead. They had not yet even begun shaping the new wheel shaft before they were taken by the Ixal. You slay the birdmen, but a new worm of unease coils in your belly. Go speak with Belmont."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB708_00903_SEQ_03","You tell Belmont of what passed, reflecting that too many of your reports from Coerthas end with vengeance rather than rescue. Belmont gives voice to the consternation you yourself feel─Ishgard's enemies are legion, but the obsession with the dragons blinds the knights and perhaps the Holy See..."

All manner of nasties that don't breathe fire kill just as many men, but that's neither here nor there for them."
