1,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_SEQ_01","Wedge has again implored you to search for Biggs. Though Abelie's suggestion yielded nothing, it is possible that one of the other Ishgardians stationed at Monument Tower might be able to point you in a more fruitful direction."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_SEQ_02","Ignace suggests that Biggs may have attempted to reach Whitebrim Front. If true, he would have needed to make his way through Daniffen Pass, whose southern entrance is found to the northeast of Monument Tower."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_SEQ_03","With the aid of Yda and Y'shtola, you succeed in rescuing Biggs from a detachment of imperial troops. Make your way back to Monument Tower and speak with Wedge."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_SEQ_04","With Biggs's safe return, the three core members of Garlond Ironworks are together again, and the future seems brighter for their reunion. Now it is time to turn your thoughts to the next challenge: rescuing Minfilia and the remaining Scions."

82,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_YSHTOLA_000_083","I myself have asked the same question. That day, when I returned to the carnage at the Waking Sands, I noted naught amiss in Horizon─nothing at all to suggest the passing of an imperial force. From this, I conclude that the Garleans came neither by land nor by air. Nay, they were borne there by potent teleportation magicks─magicks of the kind used by the Ascians."

84,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_WEDGE_000_090","We were bound and blindfolded, and bundled into the cargo bay of a waiting airship."

88,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_100","What happened next?"
89,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_WEDGE_000_101","Well, we were held in isolation for what felt like years, but was probably moons...or maybe only weeks. And then, without warning, the imperials collected the pair of us, and put us on another vessel, which we found out was bound for Garlemald, much to our dread. We knew that if we were taken back there, we weren't like to leave again."
90,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_WEDGE_000_102","So, risky though it was, we sabotaged the ship's altitude control and thereby forced an emergency landing. And in the midst of the ensuing chaos, we managed to slip our captors. The rest, as they say, is history."
91,"TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_103","Hah! If I didn't know better, I'd call that a likely story! Sabotaging the altitude controls of an airborne vessel!? That will have been Biggs's handiwork, like as not. You always were resourceful in a tight spot, my friend!"
