1,"TEXT_GAIUSC407_00982_SEQ_01","Wedge has implored you to search for Biggs, who is still alone in the cold with the enemy on his trail. Perhaps one of the Ishgardians stationed at Monument Tower has seen something. Begin by asking Abelie."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC407_00982_SEQ_02","While Abelie has not seen Biggs, she suggests that he might have taken refuge within the Fury's Gaze, south of Monument Tower. For want of a better lead, make your way there and investigate."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC407_00982_SEQ_03","Your search of the Fury's Gaze yields nothing but a confrontation with vengeful ghosts. Report back to Wedge, who awaits you in Monument Tower."
