1,"TEXT_GAIUSB705_00900_SEQ_01","A patrol of knights, fresh from triumph on the front, has been led astray by will-o'-the-wykes in the blizzard. Of those that returned, many are badly frostbitten. There is only one thing to be done: four wykes must be dispatched by your capable hands."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB705_00900_SEQ_02","The wykes are slain. The lowly adventurer succeeds where the High Houses have failed, though you should keep the thought to yourself if you enjoy owning a tongue. Return to Ser Corentiaux and give him the good news."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB705_00900_SEQ_03","Your report of the wykes' demise was heard with much delight. Adding the reward to your growing purse, you wonder why as insightful a man as Ser Corentiaux does not see what every child of the road does: the land itself has turned inimical, and lays siege to the hosts of Ishgard."
