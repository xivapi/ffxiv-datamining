1,"TEXT_GAIUSB810_00919_SEQ_01","Syntgoht complains that the shipment of processed ceruleum from the mines of Amajina & Sons has stopped. You wonder why he continued taking orders from customers in that case, but that is not your bailiwick. Go to Camp Bluefog and talk to the Concern's company man, Papawazu."
