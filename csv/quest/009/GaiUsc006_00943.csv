1,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_SEQ_01","Overrun with patients for many moons, the infirmary at the Front has finally persuaded the powers-that-be to assign them another chirurgeon. Astidien bids you escort this welcome new addition from Camp Dragonhead."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_SEQ_02","Alas, you and the chirurgeon have somehow missed each other. It is likely that he is dying slowly out in the snow even as you bemoan his foolishness. Find the lost chirurgeon and dose him with the life-saving maddening potion."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_SEQ_03","You find the chirurgeon and restore him to health─or at least to some version of it that will get him to the Front. On a second thought, it was possibly a poor decision to let loose a recently frozen naif under the influence of anything described as “maddening.” It would behoove you to find him again."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_SEQ_04","You appear in the nick of time to strike down two dragonflies attacking the chirurgeon. Disaster seems to love this man, but still, speak to him."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_SEQ_05","You allow the chirurgeon to go his way, for he seemed calm enough. Besides, it is known that a man who escapes death twice in one day will escape it the third time as well. Take yourself to Astidien and tell him the tale."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_SEQ_06","As you predicted, the chirurgeon not only reached the Front, but is cheating death for the third time as you make your report to Astidien. The head chirurgeon may feel otherwise, but your road sense tells you the naif will do much good here."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_ASTIDIEN_000_001","This has taxed the infirmary beyond all natural limits, and the healers show signs of becoming patients."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_ASTIDIEN_000_002","After some doing, I have managed to secure a chirurgeon from Camp Dragonhead. From the reluctance they evinced at the transfer order, he must have great promise. I would be easier in my mind if you would escort him here."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_BRAITOGNIEUX_000_013","Here, take this bottle of maddening potion, for he is like to be frozen. Tcha, we cannot have this recklessness when he is tasked with saving lives!"

64,"TEXT_GAIUSC006_00943_ASTIDIEN_000_042","It bodes not well that he failed to prepare himself for the potion's aftereffects. I begin to think that taking on new staff is not the panacea I had hoped for..."
