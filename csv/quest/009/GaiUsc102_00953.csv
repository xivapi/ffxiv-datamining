To breach the barrier, Cid has devised a plan to harness the power of a corrupted crystal. While he himself has no idea where to find one, he knows a man who might─the scholar, Lamberteint, who resides in Camp Drybone."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_SEQ_02","After learning of your shared interest in corrupted crystals, Professor Lamberteint seems eager to discuss his work. With any luck, your time in Thanalan will be brief and forgettable."
