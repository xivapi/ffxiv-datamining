The clever youngling is looking for someone."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_SEQ_01","In the now-desolate streets of Yesterland, you encounter a young boy looking for his brother. Perhaps disoriented by the present state of the city, he seems doubtful of his ability to conduct a thorough search alone. He bids you speak with him again should you be willing to assist.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_SEQ_02","You agree to accompany the clever youngling, and together, make your way to the Bergmähr-Ring.

※You must be accompanied by the clever youngling to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_SEQ_03","The merry-go-round stands still, and the once-teeming plaza is devoid of life─a stark contrast to the tales of fun and games the child is kind enough to share with you. With no sign of the missing brother, the pair of you head for the esperance wheels to continue the search."
4,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_SEQ_04","You arrive at the motionless hulks of the esperance wheels, and yet again fail to find signs of the boy's brother. As your discussions stray from tales of youthful recklessness to ceruleum contraptions, the truth about his circumstances begins to dawn on the clever youngling. The look of consternation on his face prompts you to inquire further."
5,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_SEQ_05","Hearing your news of the outside world, the boy seems to age before your very eyes. The news that his beloved brother is likely safe and sound rouses the boy─now an elderly man─prompting him to reflect upon his life inside the dome. Thankful and relieved, the man fades out of existence─his metaphorical search at an end."

50,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_001","I'm looking for my brother, you see. The two of us were hardly ever apart, which is why I'm starting to think I'll be stuck here until we're reunited."
51,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_002","But I'm worried about overlooking something... Would you mind coming with me?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_003","If you're able to help, just say the word."
53,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_004","You'll help me look for him? Yay! Thank you!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_005","I've already checked near the air cab station, so let's head for the Bergmähr-Ring."

63,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_Q3_000_011","Are you sure you wish to part ways with the clever youngling?"
64,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_012","Oh, did something urgent come up? Don't worry, I'll be waiting for you where we first spoke."
65,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_013","You're back! Right, let's keep looking."
66,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_015","The Bergmähr-Ring was great. It was so fun to ride, and beautiful too, especially when it was all lit up. Seeing it always used to make me happy."
67,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_016","Some of the naughty kids used to have competitions to see how far they could launch their shoes while they were riding it."
68,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_017","Once, someone accidentally sent their shoe flying right into Otis while he was on patrol. You should've seen the look on their face!"
69,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_018","It's strange seeing this place so empty now... No sign of my brother, either."
70,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_019","We should take a look near the esperance wheels next."
71,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_020","I remember a game some of us used to play here. Two people would split up and ride on opposite wheels, then when the cabins got close enough, we'd reach out and try to link hands. It was quite the stretch, and you had to do all that while the cabins were moving... It's a miracle none of us got hurt."
72,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_021","Apparently, any pair that pulled it off would share an unbreakable bond. I was always a bit skeptical though..."
73,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_022","Still, part of me wishes I'd given it a try with my brother."
74,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_023","Speaking of─there's no sign of him here either. I mean, there's no sign of <Emphasis>anyone</Emphasis>..."
75,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_024","I thought he might have wandered this way to get a glimpse of the wheels up close, but I should've known better─no doubt he'd rather be tinkering with a ceruleum engine than taking in the sights."
76,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_Q2_000_025","What will you say?"
77,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_A2_000_001","Wait, are you from Tuliyollal?"
78,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_A2_000_002","You have ceruleum in Alexandria as well?"
79,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_026","Wh-What? Don't tell me you're from Tuliyollal too."
80,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_027","Hmmm, I could've sworn I saw someone just like you when I was getting on the train that day..."
81,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_028","Does that mean people found a way of getting through the barrier after I died?"
82,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_029","Come to think of it, there was another familiar face during the performance at the castle. That was Vow Wuk Lamat with you, wasn't it? I wonder why I didn't realize it at the time..."
83,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_BOY05177_000_030","Sorry, this is a lot to take in..."

86,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_033","Ever since we were children, my brother and I have always been inseparable. When Dawnservant Koana first brought ceruleum to Tural, we both marveled at its potential, and together helped develop the dirigible technology that our society came to rely on."
87,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_034","So too were we charmed by the railroads of Shaaloani, but on that fateful day we parted ways... Since then, I've only known the confines of the dome."
88,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_035","When Vow Wuk Lamat took to the stage with you, she appeared much as she did the day of the ascension ceremony, and as a living person, no less. Might I ask how Tuliyollal fares?"
89,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_Q3_000_036","What will you say?"
90,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_A3_000_001","The people are still getting used to their new Dawnservants."
91,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_A3_000_002","Hardly any time has passed beyond the barrier."
92,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_037","The day I boarded the train, my brother decided to stay behind in Shaaloani to inspect the facilities nearby. If the world outside the dome is much the same as it was then, I can only assume he is alive and well."
93,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_038","If that's the case, I suppose this search of mine was rather futile..."
94,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_039","But if he's out there, living his life to the fullest, nothing in the world could bring me more joy."
95,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_040","The years we spent together were some of the happiest of my life. Not a moment went by that I didn't wish to return to those halcyon days."
96,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_041","That isn't to say the life I've built here hasn't been worthwhile. I drew strength from those who met the same fate in Yyasulani that day, and learned much and more from the engineers I became acquainted with."
97,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_042","It took time, but I finally see that this period of my life was just as joyful, just as fulfilling."
98,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_043","Were it not for the news you shared, I may never have come to this realization."
99,"TEXT_KINGZH004_05177_OLDER05177_000_044","Thank you. In the end, perhaps all I needed was an assurance that my dear brother is alive and well... "
