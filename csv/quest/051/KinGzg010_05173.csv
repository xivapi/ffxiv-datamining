The Cornservant seems to be marveling at the sights of Solution Nine."
1,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SEQ_01","The power of corn is boundless, as demonstrated by the Conservant's appearance in Solution Nine. It has come in search of bellies needing nourishment, but there appear to be no rumbling stomachs anywhere to be found.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SEQ_02","While the Cornservant's ear can hear no hungry stomachs in need of sustenance, they're confident that, if you venture about long enough, there is at least one to be found somewhere in Solution Nine."
3,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SEQ_03","You speak with several seemingly disgruntled citizens of Solution Nine, but none of their grievances have anything to do with hunger. The Cornservant is not one to be deterred, however, and so you continue your search."
4,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SEQ_04","After a little more searching, you come across a seemingly dejected woman all by herself. She admits to being hungry, but because she has lost her sense of taste, eating has become a chore she actively avoids. The Cornservant believes such a crisis calls for a special dish. After a brief moment of reflection, they are struck with inspiration and, within moments, conjure a most delectable taco. The woman takes a bite and is gripped by nostalgia that brings her sense of taste rushing back. She thanks both you and the Cornservant before taking her leave, promising to be better about her neglected diet."
5,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SEQ_05","The Cornservant not only helped another hungry soul in need but was at last able to be seen, which surely brought the ardent cob no small amount of joy. Even so, the world is vast, and there will always be more people who hunger for one thing or another. Thus, the Cornservant's journey will continue."

69,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SATIETYSHETONA05173_000_051","No, not at all. Though Solution Nine was recently attacked, the production facility remains intact to supply us with all the food we could ask for."
70,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_052","I can hear not a growl nor rumble coming from this one's belly. Perhaps we should look elsewhere."
71,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SATIETYSHETONA05173_000_055","So long as the production facility remains intact, we'll not want for food."

75,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_SATIETYMILALA05173_000_065","To be honest, I'm more concerned about nursing this injury than what I'm having to eat."

81,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_081","I suppose you could say I do. A strange thing to say in a place like this, where most if not all of our needs are easily met."
82,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_082","I wouldn't normally ask this of someone I don't know, but might I speak candidly about something? It's not every day someone takes an interest in my problems."

84,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_084","Because of that, I've been gradually losing interest in food. I realize I have to eat for the sake of my health, but now it's become a chore I'd rather avoid altogether."
85,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_085","How terrible. A life without flavor is no life at all! But how am I to help her...?"
86,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_086","<rustle> I've got it!"
87,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_087","<rustle> First, I grind corn into powder, work it into a dough, then use heat to make thin shells. Then we mix together several extra ingredients, layer them into the shells and...there! The most tantalizing of tacos! Surely this will reawaken her taste buds."
88,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_088","You've prepared something for me? But I told you, I'm not really in the mood."

90,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_A2_000_001","Trust me. You're going to want to try this."
91,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_A2_000_002","This dish was cooked by the great Cornservant!"
92,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_090","<sigh> Fine. If you insist."
93,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_091","The Cornservant...? I've no idea what you're talking about, it's meant to be something special. All right, let's have it."
94,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_092","It certainly has an interesting smell."
95,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_093","Oh, that was incredible! I can't remember when last I've had anything so delicious."
96,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_094","There was someone who used to make these for me when I was younger, I think. It was their specialty."
97,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_095","I wish I could remember who, but I'm afraid that memory is lost to me."
98,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_096","Like as not, they're in the cloud now. Something tells me they were quite near and dear to my heart, but it's all a blank now."
99,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_097","I'm not sad about it, but I do feel a strange, lingering sense of loss. It's hard to explain. The feeling grew over time, and before I knew it, my sense of taste was gone."
100,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_098","But this food. The texture, the smell, the taste─it takes me back to my youth."
101,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_099","Thank you, traveler. I've been reminded of something very precious that would've remained lost if not for you. I promise to do better about eating from now on."
102,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_HUNGRYWOMAN05173_000_100","And thank you, little corncob. Your cooking was simply divine."
103,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_110","<rustle> Just when all hope seemed lost, corn has prevailed once again."
104,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_111","It was admittedly shocking to discover that, even in a world where no one goes hungry, there could be such terrible discontent."
105,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_112","But with a little corn and know-how, we rekindled the memories of happier times in her. It does my cob good to see all go to plan."
106,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_113","What's more, she was able to see me! Through the power of corn and happiness no doubt."
107,"TEXT_KINGZG010_05173_CORNSERVANT_000_114","I've seen a great deal on my travels thus far, and helped no few people find satiation. But there is still much of Tural I've yet to see, and more bellies in need of nourishment. I wish you well, my friend. May your belly ever be full, and your days filled with happiness."
