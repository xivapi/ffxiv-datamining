49,"TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_001","Lately, we've been inundated with flying popotoes. Don't let the name fool you─they're nasty little critters. We laid out some repellent a while back, but the effect seems to be wearing off."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_002","Ever since that enormous dome appeared, we've had all kinds of trouble to deal with, and I just can't find the time to lay down any repellent. That must be why those darned popotoes have been showing up in droves. At this rate, the whole place'll be overrun!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_003","I'd go out there and spread the repellent myself, but they'd make a meal of me lickety-split. Reckon you could take care of it for me?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_004","Oh, and the repellent doesn't take effect right away, so any flying popotoes already there'll probably need culling the old-fashioned way. If you could take care of that, too, you'd be doing us all a huge favor!"

55,"TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_021","You see, until we figured out how to make a repellent out of bitter-smelling juices, those popotoes would wreak havoc on our crops, eat our rroneek... They even tried to take a bite out of more than one of the residents!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_022","We tried asking the Dustwatch to come deal with 'em, but they didn't wanna get involved in culling wild...um, tubers. Setting up a perimeter fence was another option, only we're short on people and building materials. That's why we came up with the repellent."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_023","Anyway, I don't need to be chewing your ear off about all that! You've done us a good turn, and I won't soon forget it."
