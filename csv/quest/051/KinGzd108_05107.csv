49,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_001","As Mamook begins to tread a different path, so should Golmajiik Grove. Or so I think. Probably. <sigh> The thing is, I'm not sure. "
50,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_002","I'd like to hear what hopes the people have for the Grove's future, but I'm afraid they wouldn't be honest if I asked. No one wants to upset the najool keepers, after all. Do you think you could ask around for me?"
51,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_003","I want to know what our people want from Golmajiik Grove going forward. In all honesty."
52,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_SONEELJA_000_004","The Grove's future? Well...the najool they grow are instrumental to our society."
53,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_SONEELJA_000_005","Both the fruit and leaves can be used for cooking and trade. So my only thought is that they should keep up the good work and grow lots of najool."
54,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_MAMOOKMOBB05107_000_006","Golmajiik Grove? Hmm... On the one hand, I'd say they should expand their operations, but that would be more difficult than it sounds..."
55,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_MAMOOKMOBB05107_000_007","Even the smaller trees in this forest are nigh impossible to fell, so clearing more space would be difficult."
56,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_MAMOOKMOBB05107_000_008","Not much of a suggestion after all, I'm afraid."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_TOJOLLJAA_000_009","If the offer of foreign crops still stands, I think our grove workers should be the ones to cultivate them."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_TOJOLLJAA_100_009","Now that we have foreign crops, I think our grove workers should collaborate with Gok Golma."
59,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_TOJOLLJAA_000_010","Their experience in growing najool makes them well suited to the job. None know our soil better, and I know they will do us proud. "
60,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_SONEELJA_000_011","Having plenty of najool on hand can never be a bad thing. Both the fruit and leaves are useful, after all."

64,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_015","People really do think about our future! That's heartening to hear."
65,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_016","Mamook's food supply can be a touchy subject. We're not supposed to talk about it, but in times of great shortage, the Autarch trades najool leaves to Iq Br'aax in exchange for provisions."
66,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_017","Going forward, I want to make sure Mamook always has plenty to eat, but...what piece of advice do you think I should prioritize?"

68,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_A1_000_001","Keep growing lots of najool, for both food and trade."
69,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_A1_000_002","Maybe try to expand your operations?"
70,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_A1_000_003","Assist with growing foreign crops."
71,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_A1_000_004","There's no need to decide just now."
72,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_018","I see... By engaging with others, Golmajiik Grove can find its own way forward alongside Mamook!"
73,"TEXT_KINGZD108_05107_ZESEELJA_000_019","You're right... Maybe it's okay for Golmajiik Grove to move at its own pace."
