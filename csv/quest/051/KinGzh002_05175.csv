Unreturned books are a nightmare for any lending library."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH002_05175_SEQ_01","The Daguerreo archivist informs you that several documents from the facility's collection have not been returned─on account of their borrowers having ceased to exist. You agree to help gather the outstanding medical history texts, and set off for the southern side of Canal Town to begin your search.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH002_05175_SEQ_02","You successfully relocate the abandoned books, perusing a few paragraphs as you go. Clearly, a great deal of knowledge is contained in these three tomes alone. No doubt the archivist will be delighted to take receipt of the missing monographs."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH002_05175_SEQ_03","With the texts back in her safekeeping, the Daguerreo archivist expounds upon the importance of documenting medical history. Mistaking you for a recent Endless arrival, she quizzes you about the latest technological advancements before returning to her work, pledging to carry out her duties until the moment she too fades away."
