49,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_001","Just northwest of here, some of the railroad workers have been attacked by a pack of snakes. Aspis, to be exact."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_002","I know what you're thinking, “Snakes don't hunt in packs, do they?” Well, these do, and there's one particularly huge one that seems to be the ringleader. If you're willing, I want you to go out there and kill it!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_003","Take out the leader and the rest'll get the message. Tricky part is, it usually stays hidden, so I recommend taking out a couple of the smaller ones to get its attention. When you're done, bring me proof of the kill, would you?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_004","Not only are aspis venomous, but they're damned big besides. Watch yourself out there!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_005","Glad to see you in one piece! So, got any snake bits to show me?"
54,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_006","Would you look at that! This must've belonged to a real whopper!"
55,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_007","I reckon we could even use this to make an antivenom. If someone gets themselves bit, it might even save their life."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_008","Y'know, I almost hate to say it, but if there's any more of that snake still out there, we could sell its skin for leather. We can even eat its meat, which is surprising tasty. This might even end up being a good source of revenue for the company!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_009","I'd better hurry, though, or the other desert critters'll leave me with nothing but the bones! Thanks for the help!"
