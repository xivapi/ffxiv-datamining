The exhausted engineer requires the aid of a sharp-eyed individual."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH006_05179_SEQ_01","You cross paths with a Milalla engineer who, despite a recent soak in Opal Springs, appears to be anything but relaxed. She begs your assistance in finding her lost blueprints, and hastily orders you to search the Arena of Valor in her stead.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH006_05179_SEQ_02","At the Arena of Valor, you discover a set of documents describing the ins and outs of the Meso Terminal. You assume them to be the engineer's blueprints, though only her confirmation will prove whether they are the ones she seeks."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH006_05179_SEQ_03","The engineer's eyes light up at the sight of the blueprints, and she confirms they are her prized possessions. She reveals herself as the mind behind the Meso Terminal's design, having once found inspiration in the parallels between Sphene and the Milalla's revered Speaker. She regards the blueprints as a symbol of her life's work, and hopes to spend her final moments basking in the terminal's presence before she fades from existence."
