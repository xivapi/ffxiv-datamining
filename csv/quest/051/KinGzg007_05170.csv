52,"TEXT_KINGZG007_05170_ADAPTERMAN05170_000_012","Someone must've put this unit out of action during the raid. No doubt it tried to turn its weapons on the very people it once kept safe. As an engineer, I'd like see the automaton restored, but military-grade components are tough to come by."

59,"TEXT_KINGZG007_05170_UNAKITE_000_024","You paid for those parts fair and square, I don't care what you do with 'em. Now, unless you're looking to spend more of your hard-earned coin, I suggest you make yourself scarce."
