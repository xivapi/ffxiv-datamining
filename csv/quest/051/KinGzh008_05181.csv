The budding botanist is breathing rather heavily."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_SEQ_01","You meet a young botanist still reeling from a frightful encounter with a fiend. The boy reveals that he was chased away while searching for plant specimens in an effort to emulate his hero. He asks you to brave the bushes in his stead, and bring back a nepheletta fronds, irenaris leaves, and some banana leaves for his colellection.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_SEQ_02","You manage to gather the requisite leaves. Time to head back to the Cleyra Museum of Nature and deliver the specimens to the youth."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_SEQ_03","The budding botanist thanks you profusely for helping him complete his collection. He goes on to share with you a wealth of knowledge gleaned from hours of diligent study, and reveals he once harbored a wish to travel far and wide, before poor health forced him to abandon his plans. Hearing your tales of adventure, however, reignites a flame within the boy, and he renews his vow to explore the world. When he fades from existence, his eyes are gleaming with unmistakable wonder."

49,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_001","I'm here to collect all sorts of leaves and flowers, just like my hero!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_002","I was looking for plants to add to my collection when a fiend burst out of the bushes and chased me away. I've only just caught my breath..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_003","I know it's a lot to ask, but would you mind helping me out?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_004","I'm looking for nepheletta fronds, irenaris leaves, and some banana leaves. You should be able to find everything nearby!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_005","I need nepheletta fronds, irenaris leaves, and banana leaves for my collection. You shouldn't have to roam too far!"

55,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_007","Whoa, thank you so much! I'm annoyed I couldn't do it alone, but thanks to you, my Living Memory plant collection is complete!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_008","Have you heard of nepheletta? People take the fronds and use them to brew a nice, warming tea! One of my books says that travelers and merchants used to drink it all the time before the war."
57,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_009","Apparently, the second type of leaf I asked you to get─irenaris─is really, really bitter! I heard they used it in a lot of old Alexandrian dishes. People must have had different tastes back then..."
58,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_010","And then there's banana leaves. In Tural they use the leaves to wrap different kinds of fillings before cooking them. I've never tried it personally, but that's what my hero told me!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_011","I suppose I should also tell you a little bit about her. She had the loveliest long ears, and used to talk with me all the time in Heritage Found. I remember she once laughed at me for calling her “miss”─she said she wasn't as young as I thought!"
60,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_012","She knew so much about plants and animals, and she'd tell me all kinds of amazing stories about her travels."

62,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_014","I heard that and decided I'd make it <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> life's work too. But when I told her I wanted to go on an adventure, she said to wait until I was older and wiser, and ready to stand on my own two feet. Well, after that, I got sick, and in the end..."
63,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_015","I guess I wasn't being realistic. I was so obsessed with the idea of collecting new plants and finding all sorts of amazing trees that I forgot about my health─I've always been frail, you see."
64,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_016","I wanted to visit Cleyra too. You know, the place they named this museum after. I read that the town is built on top of a giant tree protected by swirling sandstorms. Apparently, it's on the same continent as Alexandria..."
65,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_017","Speaking of giant trees, have you ever seen any?"
66,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_Q1_000_018","What will you say?"
67,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_A1_000_001","During my time in the Black Shroud, I saw a truly towering specimen called the Guardian Tree."
68,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_A1_000_002","The Rak'tika Greatwood is filled with the biggest trees you could imagine."
69,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_A1_000_003","On Aloalo, there are mighty trees bristling with ancient statues."
70,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_019","Whoa, I've never heard about that place... You must be a traveler, just like my hero!"
71,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_020","Oh, I think I've read about those statues in one of my books on the Milalla. If you've seen a place like that─you must have traveled the whole wide world!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_021","I'd given up on my idea of going on a big adventure, but after hearing your stories, I can't bear the thought of not living out my dream! Just you wait, one day I'll see the world and all it has to offer."
73,"TEXT_KINGZH008_05181_BOY05181_000_022","After all, there's so much more out there than my books could ever tell me!"
