Toanzohe is seeking help with a family matter."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_SEQ_01","Toanzohe is visiting Hhusatahwi to check on his grandson. He is convinced they have gotten themselves into some sort of trouble, but the grandson refuses to talk about what the problem might be. He expects they may be willing to talk with a traveler passing through town, and so Toanzohe begs you go in and speak with the seemingly troubled youth.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_SEQ_02","You find the grandson upstairs, who introduces himself as Zitekkwa. He works as a moneylender, a profession Toanzohe apparently disapproves of. He wishes to win his grandfather over, and believes a firsthand account of what his work entails may be the key to doing it. To that end, he asks you accompany him on the job."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_SEQ_03","Zitekkwa has loaned money to a number of clients, and the time has come for him to collect. The first on his list is a man named Wakkwaze. Zitekkwa asks you to meet him on the outskirts of town, where he expects to find his client returning home from work."
4,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_SEQ_04","Zitekkwa confronts Wakkwaze, who claims to have forgotten when he was expected to repay his debt. His nervousness, however, suggests he is not being entirely truthful. Rather than resort to brute force, Zitekkwa asks that you intimidate Wakkwaze with a flex."
5,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_SEQ_05","Wakkwaze is not wont to argue with one so hefty of frame, and readily hands over the money he owes. He then goes on to explain he was avoiding repayment so that he could purchase a lavish gift for his lady friend. Zitekkwa reminds Wakkwaze the importance of being responsible with his money and sends him on his way. A job well done, but there yet remain clients on Zitekkwa's list."

49,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_TOANZOHE_000_002","The name's Toanzohe. I'm not from around here, truth be told. I live in Luwateninyawawsa, but I'm here visiting my grandson."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_TOANZOHE_000_003","I was excited to see him after so long, but then I spied him dealing with some unsavory looking man, exchanging unusually large sums of money."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_TOANZOHE_000_004","I confronted him about what I saw, but he'll say little more than “it's just a misunderstanding,” then grumble as he changes the subject. I realize this is sudden, but could you see if there's anything to be done to help him? He's in trouble─I just know it."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_TOANZOHE_100_004","Oh, a weight's been lifted off my heart. Bless you, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>! "
53,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_TOANZOHE_000_005","His name's Zitekkwa. Last I saw him, he was heading inside this here saloon. The Tonawawta with a red cap, pulled down over his face to cover those bruises, most like. You can't miss him."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_TOANZOHE_000_006","He's quite fond of this saloon, so I'm sure he's still in there. I hope he's all right..."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_010","Hm? A new face in town, eh? Well, what can I do you for?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_011","Thinks I'm in trouble, does he? There he goes jumping to conclusions as usual. I thought it'd be less of a hassle if I didn't tell him."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_012","Truth is, I've been helping other folk in town with their money troubles. Matter of fact, the man you saw leaving just a moment ago is one of my clients."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_013","I should probably explain from the beginning."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_014","My work involves loaning gil to folks having trouble with coin for one reason or another. There's a reason I don't lend them pel, but I'll get to that in a moment."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_015","My family's lived here long before there was ever a town here. But then people moved in and they started expanding. Before long, Kemakka's family approached us about selling our land."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_016","It was around the time when trade overseas was gaining in popularity. I had it on good authority that gil was on its way to becoming common currency here in the wilds, so I decided to sell the land for gil, and use those funds to start my business."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_017","Sure enough, everything went as expected, and the business is starting to do well. It's not without its troubles, seeing as money is involved, but I never lend to any unsavory types."
63,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
64,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_A1_000_000","Your grandfather's worried sick about you."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_A1_000_001","Why not simply explain all this to your grandfather?"
66,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_018","The whole point of me keeping quiet was so I wouldn't make him worry. Seems my silence only made things worse."
67,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_019","He found himself in a real tight corner once. Gil's what got him there, and now he wants nothing to do with the stuff."
68,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_020","When I told him about my idea to sell the land, the moment “gil” came out of my mouth, his whole mood turned sour. He said he'd put everything in my name, and whatever happens after that is on me."
69,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_021","It's not exactly easy to bring up my work when it involves the one thing he seems to hate more than anything. But maybe it's time I changed that."
70,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_022","This job does more than just put food on the table. I'm able to help people─help this town. But how do I get him to see that?"
71,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_023","I've got it─you're going to come and watch me work."
72,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_024","Grandpa won't hear anything I have to say if it involves gil, but he might come around to a firsthand account from you. So come and see what good my work does for Hhusatahwi, and how I help the people here. "
73,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_025","He did send you here to help me, didn't he? I promise to make it worth your while."
74,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_030","Right then. Before we get started, I should probably know who it is I'm working with."

76,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_032","He had a pretty bad accident on the job a while back. Had no money for treatment or much of anything, really, so I loaned him the gil he needed to keep on his feet."
77,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_033","But now it's well past time he returns what he owes and he hasn't said a word. There's been time enough for him to not only return back to work, but also receive his wages. Several times, in fact."
78,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_034","He usually comes here into town when he's not working, and his shift ends soon. Meet me just outside of town. If we're lucky, we'll catch him just as he arrives."
79,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_040","Explain yourself, Wakkwaze."
80,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_WAKKWAZE_000_041","You're here for the money? I-I was gonna pay, honest! I just mixed up the dates is all. Can't we settle this later? I'm busy."
81,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_042","I know you're lying, Wakkwaze, and you're not going anywhere until you can look me in the eye and tell me why you're late paying me back."
82,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_043","He's obviously hiding something, but I'm not looking to start trouble. I don't suppose there's anything you can do to, uh...persuade him? Maybe a little <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>flex<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> to show him we're serious."

84,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_WAKKWAZE_000_045","Don't look at me like that. I just forgot when the money was due, I swear!"
85,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_SYSTEM_000_046","Wakkwaze seems intent on hiding the truth. Show him you mean business with a brief <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>flex<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>."

88,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_WAKKWAZE_000_049","When I was still on the mend, my lady friend took really good care of me, see. I wanted to buy her something fancy to thank her, and, well..."
89,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_050","I understand. Really, I do. But if you really want to make her happy, you need to get your life together."

92,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_051","I can't blame him for wanting to show his appreciation to a loved one, but it's no excuse to get carried away with his spending."
93,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_ZITEKKWA_000_052","So, what do you think of my job? The money I loaned him paid for his treatment, and supported him through his recovery. That has to count for something, right?"

95,"TEXT_KINGZE201_05140_A2_000_000","I'm still not convinced."
