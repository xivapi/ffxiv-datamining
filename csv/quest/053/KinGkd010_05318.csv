While unwilling to commit the expedition's resources to exploring the tower, he nonetheless gives tacit approval to your own potential forays within. For his part, the veteran seafarer has turned his attentions to the next stage of the expedition, and bids you return to Tuliyollal and inform the messenger of progress thus far."

Progress report complete, all that remains is to await news of Ketenramm's ingress into the north horn and the resumption of your adventures upon the Occult Crescent..."
