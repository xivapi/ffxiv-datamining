1,"TEXT_KINGKW001_05319_SEQ_01","You encounter Lydirceil by the isle's fledgling smithy, bemoaning the disorderly conduct of the master artisan hired for the expedition. After spending much of the journey to the Occult Crescent languishing in the ship's hold and making a sizable dent in the crew's liquid provisions, it would appear the weaponsmith has attempted to flee. Lydirceil bids you seek out the man in question─Gerolt─and implore him to return."
2,"TEXT_KINGKW001_05319_SEQ_02","Gerolt turns out to be in the midst of a fruitless quest for rum among a pile of supply crates. According to the weaponsmith, he was not made aware of the expedition's destination until the ship had already left High Tide Harbor─perhaps explaining the erratic behavior Lydirceil recounted. Realizing that fulfilling his contractual duties will be the fastest way off the isle, Gerolt makes his way back to smithy, ready─though hardly raring─to work. No doubt Lydirceil will wish to thank you for locating the wayward weaponsmith."
3,"TEXT_KINGKW001_05319_SEQ_03","With Gerolt returned, Lydirceil is eager to see him earn his keep. The weaponsmith, however, considers all but the most challenging commissions beneath him, and outlines his plans for a brand-new weapon enhancement technique. Lydirceil acknowledges the folly of having a realm-renowned craftsman perform the everyday drudgery of running a smithy, and begrudgingly assents. According to Gerolt, your weapon can be raised to hitherto unimaginable heights of power through the use of crystalline objects known as demiatma.

※Three pieces of six unique varieties are required, and these can be obtained from FATEs and critical encounters on the Occult Crescent's south horn, or from FATEs in the following regions:
Urqopacha, Kozama'uka, Yak T'el, Shaaloani, Heritage Found, or Living Memory."
4,"TEXT_KINGKW001_05319_SEQ_04","You deliver the requisite six varieties of demiatma to the weaponsmith, who seems eager to begin─not least because renewed access to the expedition's rum supply is contingent on his progress. Taking the crystals, he vows to imbue his tools in preparation for the enhancement process."
