※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_01","To slake your thirst for freedom from this hot Eorzean summer, Mayaru Moyaru suggests you pay a visit to Costa del Sol, where the Moonfire Faire is being held on the <Emphasis>Queen Lhaminn</Emphasis>, a remodeled ship. Promised unparalleled recreation, you sally forth to witness the seaside delights at hand.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_02","Chief Chaperone Haermaga was hoping Mayaru Moyaru would send along someone like you, which makes you suspect your visit might entail more than fun and games.

3,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_03","Haermaga gives you an overview of the ship's activities: cannon rides, water chutes, a swimming bath, and even a stage for performers. Additionally, Lhaminn's Coastguard works tirelessly to ensure the guests' comfort and security, and it is to this group of elite swimmers Haermaga would recruit you. P'obyano has been charged with uniform allocation, so you inquire with her before setting out on your first patrol."
4,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_04","After a bit of digging, P'obyano pulls out a set of maritime attire expertly tailored to your size. Only while wearing it will you be recognizable to those in need as an official member of the Coastguard.

※You must be wearing the costume provided by P'obyano to complete this task. Speak with her again to prolong or restore the guise."
5,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_05","On your patrol, you witness the gaiety of the guests alongside the dedicated efforts of your fellows in Lhaminn's Coastguard. Beaudefoin and R'fhul Tia are both especially pleased with the thoughtful design of the uniforms. When you encounter Hildelana, however, a more pressing matter is raised: one of the water chutes' wooden support beams has begun to splinter beneath the surface. She elects to remain nearby to direct the guests away from it, but this is only a stopgap measure until Haermaga is informed."
6,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_06","With your patrol concluded, you report your observations to Haermaga, who assures you that he will arrange for the splintering beam to be repaired at once. Your conversation is interrupted, however, by a call for help somewhere on the coastline. By the sound of it, a woman is in distress─but before you can rescue her, you will need to find her."
7,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_07","The moment the drowning woman is located, Haermaga leaps into action. Once she is brought ashore, he decides the best place for her to rest is aboard the <Emphasis>Queen Lhaminn</Emphasis>, where a healer is on standby for emergency situations precisely like these. It seems the two of you were meant to be introduced in a less dramatic fashion, but to what end, Haermaga has yet to reveal."
8,"TEXT_FESSUX101_05321_SEQ_08","Haermaga introduces the Miqo'te woman as T'zanza, the Ul'dahn weaver who worked tirelessly to craft the Coastguard uniforms. Concerned about her design's functionality, she sought to observe it from afar─yet ended up requiring the Coastguard's assistance in the process. Though she laments the trouble she caused, she feels proud to have contributed to the safety of the event. Lhaminn's Coastguard, for its part, has nothing but praise for her work.

Since you have completed your shift, Haermaga makes good on his promise to let you keep the maritime attire, though this gift may naturally lead to another patrol or two around the facility─if only for safety's sake."
