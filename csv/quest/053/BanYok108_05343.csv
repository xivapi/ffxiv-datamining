49,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_VUYARGUR_000_001","One such method is the use of melting salts. We must regularly spread them around the stones, lest their edges crack and dull from the bitter cold."
50,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_VUYARGUR_000_002","It has proven vital to our restoration, and we seek extra pairs of hands to aid us in the salting. If you wish to lend yours, our stonekeeper can apprise you of the details."
51,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_VUYARGUR_000_005","Our new stonework stands as proud as ever, but we must continue to salt the stones if we wish to preserve their integrity. If you've time to aid us again, we would be most grateful."

54,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_CITIZENA05343_000_011","The work is quite simple, really. For your part, I'd like you to scatter the salts around Warmth."
55,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_CITIZENA05343_000_012","I'll take care of the other areas, so once you've applied your share, you're free to report back to Vuyargur."
56,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_CITIZENA05343_000_015","Here to assist, yes? Much obliged. I was just about to start the salting, so why don't we split the work again? I'll leave Warmth to you, as before."

58,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_VUYARGUR_000_020","I hear you were hard at work spreading melting salts at Warmth! The stonekeeper and I greatly appreciate the effort. Were you aware that the salts we use are brought to us by Nopli?"
59,"TEXT_BANYOK108_05343_VUYARGUR_000_021","As he tells it, he's procured a healthy supply from the Yok Huy at Chirwagur Saltern. He is brave to consort with such dangerous folk...but that fearlessness speaks to his experience as a merchant."
