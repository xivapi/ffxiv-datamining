2,"TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_02","Upon arriving at the foot of the terminal, Sphene relives her recent awakening. She gives thanks to those who have preserved the spirit of her beloved Alexandria, past and present, and together you reaffirm your commitment to fighting against Calyx's callous designs. The opening in the structure's wall glitters with golden energy, inviting you to venture within and confront the architect of Alexandria's mounting mortal dilemma...

3,"TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_03","You have defeated the Endless entities Calyx has sent against you and secured a path to the Meso Terminal's upper reaches. Now you must ascend to the structure's pinnacle, there to bring an end to this calculated confrontation.

4,"TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_04","Calyx commends you on your perseverance in reaching him. As you persist in refusing to yield the key, however, he proceeds to summon an entity designed for the sole purpose of defeating you. The chamber darkens with an innervating chill, and the fear of inevitable death flowing from Alexandria's enthralled citizens feeds the manifestation of a terrifying primal being. Though the device holding Calyx's memories is tantalizingly close, you must first contend with this horror whose grasp promises naught but eternal darkness.

5,"TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_05","Fighting as one, you triumph over the summoned primal, and you feel the pall of fear lift from your beleaguered hearts. It is time to bring an end to Calyx's Endless ambitions, and return with your companions to the promenades of Living Memory."
6,"TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_06","You strike against the memory bank, only to discover it is shielded by a powerful barrier. As Calyx mocks your efforts, the air grows heavy, the weight of mortal dread once more pressing down upon you. In a dry, academic tone, Calyx explains that the experience of death has only strengthened his creation─that it will rise, again and again, until the lightning aether suffusing his ravaged world is drained to its last spark. However, his promise of enduring memories prompts Sphene to recall the true meaning of those words and the comfort they were meant to offer. With Shale's help, she broadcasts a message of hope across Alexandria, buoying the citizens and interrupting the flow of prayer to the primal. Taking advantage of its momentary weakness, your party divides its efforts, with one half battling the entity, and the other working to bring down the barrier protecting the device. Wuk Lamat and Sphene's combined attack finally shatters the energy shield, while Alisaie delivers the killing blow to your enfeebled enemy. Calyx can only monitor the progress of his memory transfer in silent desperation as you spring into action, your decisive strike causing the memory bank to erupt in a spectacular explosion. In the wake of this destruction, Calyx has winked out of existence, and an exhausted Wuk Lamat collapses to the ground, her promise fulfilled."
7,"TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_07","You exit the terminal with the unconscious Wuk Lamat, and Alphinaud concludes that his patient will survive to see another morrow─though she will be spending that day and many others resting abed. With Preservation no longer a threat, he offers to remain behind until Vow Koana comes to retrieve her. Meanwhile, you and your comrades must return to the outskirts, and begin the task of putting Alexandria and its people back to rights."
8,"TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_08","In the aftermath of the primal summoning, it becomes clear that all who adopted the neo regulators have fallen under the entity's sway. Alexandria's government and citizens have come together to bring the afflicted into custody, but it may help ease Sphene's mind to see the state of the people firsthand."
