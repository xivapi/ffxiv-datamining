1,"TEXT_KINGMI101_05364_SEQ_01","The machine rampages have caused much strife and heartache, and while there have since been no new incidents to report, Gulool Ja warns that his renewed control over the now-disarmed soldiers may be temporary at best. Calyx, the mastermind behind the attacks, seems capable of commandeering Alexandria's machines at will. Sphene recalls what she can of the genius engineer from her age, and attempts to make sense of his declared motivations for “improving” mankind. While Preservation did indeed contribute to Alexandria's growth and development in centuries past, Calyx's fixation on creating Endless has led to untold suffering. He must be stopped─but if you would foil his schemes, Shale laments that you will first need to find him. To that end, Geode suggests a patrol to survey the streets and search for information which may help lead you to your elusive enemy."
2,"TEXT_KINGMI101_05364_SEQ_02","You reconvene on the street outside the Neon Stein, where Geode considers the uneasy faces of his countrymen. Bolstered by Sphene's faith in Alexandrians to decide a course for the future, he turns his full attention to the task at hand. While Krile and Sphene will patrol the west of the recreation zone, you and Geode look to question citizens in the east."
3,"TEXT_KINGMI101_05364_SEQ_03","Geode is ready to begin your patrol and speak with the people you meet along the way. He suggests paying special attention to those appearing overwhelmed or overly excited, in the hopes that they might yield more useful details about the current situation.

※You must be accompanied by Geode to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_KINGMI101_05364_SEQ_04","You make your way through the recreation zone and speak with several residents about the recent attacks. Geode then muses that there was one factor in their stories you all neglected to consider previously: that the victims may not have been wearing regulators. With this suspicion in mind, you take to the streets to speak with the locals once more."
5,"TEXT_KINGMI101_05364_SEQ_05","Your specific line of questioning leads to the confirmation that people without regulators were almost certainly being targeted. Armed with this new information, you look to rejoin Krile and Sphene at the agreed rendezvous point."
6,"TEXT_KINGMI101_05364_SEQ_06","After sharing your findings with the others, you recall another familiar detail in the story you heard from Malachite. Bodies had gone missing from several sites where citizens died in both the outskirts and recreation zones, and in their place were found strange piles of dust. As you make plans to investigate further, a panicked Gulool Ja contacts you with a plea for help, fearing that the residential radii have come under attack.

You hasten to the apartment buildings and find hostile mechanical soldiers assaulting the residents. No sooner have you saved one citizen than you hear a commotion coming from Isadora and Milos's quarters. Upon entering, you find the aftermath of Wayakkwe's battle with a murderous drone, but the wounded Oblivion member urges you to tend to Isadora first. Sphene puts her retrained magicks to work, healing the critically injured mother and comforting the distraught Milos. The worst appears to have passed, but Wayakkwe remains visibly shaken..."
