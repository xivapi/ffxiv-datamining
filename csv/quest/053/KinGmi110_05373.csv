1,"TEXT_KINGMI110_05373_SEQ_01","You pause a moment to let Shale savor the recent victory. For her, it represents the culmination of years of rebellion, and marks the end of an era for Oblivion itself. Triumphs aside, Krile wonders if you have seen the last of the troubles arising from the key. The Scion leaves you with that unsettling thought as she heads off to her meeting with G'raha Tia and the city officials. Shale, too, returns to her own waiting tasks, but not before inviting you to rest in the Backroom while you watch over Alexandria's return to normalcy."
2,"TEXT_KINGMI110_05373_SEQ_02","You while away the days in the Backroom, coming and going as you please. In the weeks that pass, Oblivion uncovers several Preservation facilities and makes a comprehensive study of regulator function. This leads to the understanding that memories of the deceased were never truly erased, merely locked away, and that this process can be reversed by sending a signal from the Meso Terminal.

Acting at the government's behest, your party and Sphene escort Gossan to Living Memory, where a much-recovered Wuk Lamat makes a surprise appearance. Together, you reactivate the terminals, and restore the memories of those who consented. The reaction in Alexandria is immediate and bittersweet, with many bursting into tears at the sudden flood of long-lost remembrances.

Gossan is grateful for your actions, and responds to Sphene's request to remain in Alexandria with an unexpected demand of his own: it seems that, inspired by the gentle leadership she displayed when despair held the kingdom in thrall, the people have insisted that she take her rightful place as their monarch. After much flustered deliberation, Sphene accepts the role, declaring peace and prosperity for Alexandria as her foremost purpose. Thus do you stand witness to the rise of a new Queen of Reason."
3,"TEXT_KINGMI110_05373_SEQ_03","A determined Sphene returns to meet her citizens with her chief aide at her side, the Scions joining them to assist with any confusion stemming from memory restoration. Erenville and Wuk Lamat also prepare to depart, the Vow of Resolve urging you to come and visit her at the palace so that she and Koana might thank you properly for your deeds."
4,"TEXT_KINGMI110_05373_SEQ_04","You approach the two Vows outside Vollok Shoonsa only to find Gulool Ja there as well, having come to begin his training under the Landsguard. After showing enthusiastic support for her nephew's ambition to learn swordplay, Wuk Lamat turns her attention to you. She expresses joy at how events unfolded for the queens past and present, and thanks you for helping her fulfill her promise. Erenville, meanwhile, speaks of an impending extended journey, and Koana declares his intent to compile a thorough account of Tuliyollan history even as he attends to his day-to-day administrative duties. With plans shared and assurances to reunite exchanged, they send you on your way back to Sphene and the other Scions."
5,"TEXT_KINGMI110_05373_SEQ_05","Your arrival in Alexandria is met with discussion of the daunting tasks which lie ahead of Sphene, now that her kingdom will engage more openly with the other nations of Etheirys. Her citizens, too, have elected to face their grief with courage─the precious memories they have reclaimed serving to guide and sustain them through the days to come. Whether you are staying to investigate Preservation's mysteries, or departing to seek distant adventures, the soon-to-be-crowned Queen of Reason offers you all, her cherished comrades, the eternal hospitality of the nation you so valiantly saved."
