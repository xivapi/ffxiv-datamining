1,"TEXT_KINGKW101_05380_SEQ_01","Lydirceil informs you the surveyors have unearthed a new variety of ore with potential for use in the weapon enhancement process. While the team works to procure a sufficient quantity, the smithy foreman is eager to plan for the next phase of the endeavor. His efforts to secure Gerolt's continued cooperation have been unsuccessful, however, with the weaponsmith once again fixated on rum and the excessive consumption thereof. In the hopes of leveraging his pride as a craftsman and spurring him to action, Lydirceil bids you cast /doubt on Gerolt's capabilities.

※Speak to Lydirceil if you wish to abandon this quest."
2,"TEXT_KINGKW101_05380_SEQ_02","Having been subjected to the full force of your doubt, Gerolt reveals that, despite appearances, he has been contemplating how best to proceed. His grand idea: have someone else figure it out. More specifically, your resident knife-wielding know-it-all, the Archive. An exasperated Lydirceil calls the scholar-turned-tonberry over, who, once apprised of the situation, reveals unsealed knowledge of an ancient imbuing process known as “aetheric infusion.” The method turns out to be rather labor-intensive, requiring four vessels known as “aetherwells” to be filled with energy via repeated, intense combat. Enthused by the idea of acquiring this long-lost art, Gerolt offers to coat the aetherwells with a solution to increase their aetheric absorption rate and thus speed up the process. You are to collect the requisite ingredients and deliver them to the weaponsmith when ready.

Rroneek glue: seek a trader in the markets of Tuliyollal.
Ut'ohmu siderite: seek a Yak T'el trader who deals in precious stones.
Three varieties of synthetic dark matter: craft using the relevant recipe or purchase from the market board.

※Should you choose to craft the synthetic dark matter, you will need to have obtained the Master Recipe XII tomes of the Disciples of the Hand."

4,"TEXT_KINGKW101_05380_SEQ_04","The Lalafellin metallurgist finishes applying the solution to the empty aetherwells, thereby boosting their capacity to absorb the aether generated in battle. Despite this provision to expedite the process, no doubt many a grueling bout of bloodshed lies ahead..."
