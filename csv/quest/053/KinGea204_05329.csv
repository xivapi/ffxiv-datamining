1,"TEXT_KINGEA204_05329_SEQ_01","With no other pressing matters at hand, Bakool Ja Ja suggests the group press on to the dome where you are to meet with Oblivion. Alxaal, too, appears ready to depart. Prishe, meanwhile, is peering off into the distance, lost in thought. Bakool Ja Ja gently draws her attention back from the horizon, and the four of you are soon on your way."
2,"TEXT_KINGEA204_05329_SEQ_02","The impending meeting with Oblivion prompts Prishe to give voice to the idle musings that previously held her attention. The idea of merely being an echo weighs heavy on her mind, but Alxaal reminds her that─even if she is not the real Prishe─the future is what they make of it, and there is nothing to stop her from finding her own place in the world. She finds comfort in his words, but it quickly gives way to panic when a terrible pain suddenly shoots through her. For a brief moment, her body is enveloped in electric current, and an electrope cube can be seen thrumming in her chest. Fearing time may be running out, Alxaal urges the group to hurry to the dome."

He is admittedly unsure what he can do to help Alxaal and Prishe, but he is nevertheless determined to do all he can to be of assistance. First, he will need to collect samples to study. This leaves you and Bakool Ja Ja idle, and so he suggests the two of you return to Brightploom Post."
