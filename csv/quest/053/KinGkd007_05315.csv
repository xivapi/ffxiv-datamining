54,"TEXT_KINGKD007_05315_ARCHIVE_000_012","The mages of Amdapor are famed for having developed white magic, with its focus on restorative and purifying arts. It was in the depths of such bastions that they honed their arcane craft."

57,"TEXT_KINGKD007_05315_A1_000_001","A keep of that size must have required a sizable workforce."
58,"TEXT_KINGKD007_05315_A1_000_002","I wonder where all the stone was sourced from."
59,"TEXT_KINGKD007_05315_ARCHIVE_000_015","The Amdapori were renowned for their use of life-imbued statues in construction and defense. I daresay the structure you surveyed was built by such stone familiars."
60,"TEXT_KINGKD007_05315_ARCHIVE_000_016","Given that transporting vast quantities of stone by ship is unfeasible, it stands to reason that some manner of quarry exists here on the island."

77,"TEXT_KINGKD007_05315_ARCHIVE_000_207","I'm afraid that will require more fieldwork on your part, my friend. And considering all we have seen thus far, there are doubtless signs of other civilizations here on the island. See if you can't find the ruins of three distinct civilizations out there. That should prove a sufficient sample size!"
