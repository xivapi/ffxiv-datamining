48,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_VUYARGUR_000_000","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you may be just the volunteer I was looking for."
49,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_VUYARGUR_000_001","The restoration efforts require a modest sum of coin, you see, and after considering our situation, a merchant friend was adamant he could find a demand for ice formed from mountain spring water."
50,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_VUYARGUR_000_002","The arrangement has us carrying the ice down the slope to our peddler acquaintance, who then sells it in the city. Every step of the journey must be swift, however, lest the precious cargo begin to melt... And our plodding gait is simply too slow."
51,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_VUYARGUR_000_003","Would you mind making the delivery in our stead? Make your way to the back of the high larder, and our ice harvester will break off the largest piece you can carry."
52,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_STORAGEYOKHUY05354_000_010","Another icicle for market? Hmmm, you might need a lighter one than usual...."
53,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_STORAGEYOKHUY05354_000_011","Here you go─a freshly harvested hunk of ice made from mountain spring water."
54,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_STORAGEYOKHUY05354_000_012","Hurry this down the slope to Solace, and you should find our peddler friend waiting by the road to Kozama'uka."
55,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_STORAGEYOKHUY05354_000_014","The ice forms in the larder in large quantities, but I'm told city people pay good money for even the smallest shard. Best get that icicle to the peddler while there's something left of it to sell!"
56,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_ICEBLOCKPELUPELU05354_000_020","Ah, you've brought the Yok Huy's ice down the mountain, have you?"
57,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_ICEBLOCKPELUPELU05354_000_021","Yes, yes, this is exquisite! So clear, so beautiful..."
58,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_ICEBLOCKPELUPELU05354_000_022","But as much as I'd like to stand here yapping about the various─and lucrative─applications of frozen mountain spring water in the culinarian field, I really must trot this over to Tuliyollal right away!"
59,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_ICEBLOCKPELUPELU05354_000_023","Thank you for the fleet-footed delivery, and please let Vuyargur know I'll bring him his share of the profits upon my return!"
60,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_VUYARGUR_000_030","Thank you for seeing the icicle safely into the peddler's hands. I imagine our patrons in Tuliyollal will be grateful for this new shipment as well."
61,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_VUYARGUR_000_031","Ordinary ice can be created through magicks, of course, but when it comes to creating frozen dishes, I am given to understand that the gentle flavor of our natural spring water is highly coveted."
62,"TEXT_BANYOK119_05354_VUYARGUR_000_032","In any case, we are fortunate to have this arrangement in place. I can only hope that the ice remains popular until we have completed work on the restorations."
