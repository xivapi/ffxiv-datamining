1,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_SEQ_01","Sphene is eager to follow the suggestion that she check in on her countrymen, but fears that speaking with those who are unaware of her return would prove more disruptive than not. Thankfully, Krile's advice to visit Mahuwsa at Yyupye's Halo seems the perfect compromise, as the fieldworker is aware of Sphene's circumstances and would surely be glad to know you all are alive and well."
2,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_SEQ_02","You are welcomed by Mahuwsa, who gives a brief account of the chaos which arose from the enthrallment of those wearing neo regulators. She is optimistic for the future, however, thanking you for putting a stop to Calyx and praising Sphene for her uplifting speech. After Mahuwsa leaves to aid the residents of the outskirts, the discussion turns to the subject of recruiting arcane practitioners to assist with the treatments. While your comrades are occupied with this endeavor, Alisaie asks if you might track down Gulool Ja, who is currently making every problem in the kingdom his personal responsibility to solve. Taapu in the driftdowns should be able to point you in his and Erenville's direction."
3,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_SEQ_03","As promised, Taapu is able to direct you to where Gulool Ja is hopefully taking a well-earned rest. She suggests you look for him somewhere in the vicinity of the old Alexandrian ruins."
4,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_SEQ_04","Delighted to see you, Gulool Ja explains that he has heard from Koana regarding Wuk Lamat's condition, but relief wars with frustration as he laments how his lack of strength has hindered his ability to help others. He then takes you to a spot where he keeps both his father's and Otis's swords, and shares his plans to train with the Landsguard that he might one day be worthy to wield these blades. Erenville offers his warm encouragement, and Gulool Ja, his path decided, wrests a promise from you to spar with him when he has grown bigger."
5,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_SEQ_05","Gulool Ja thanks you for listening to his future ambitions and assures you that he will take things one step at a time. Asserting that all is well with them for the moment, Erenville urges you to stop by the Backroom to pay Shale a visit."
6,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_SEQ_06","You arrive in the Backroom to meet a visibly relieved Shale. She expresses her heartfelt gratitude for your deeds, and the mood shifts to one of celebration."

57,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_ALISAIE_000_015","Erenville and Shale were both relieved to learn of our victory. I could practically hear the tension drain out of their voices, especially Shale's─she was quite worried for us."

76,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_YSHTOLA_000_044","Actually, this would be a good opportunity to round up other arcane practitioners, and teach everyone how to use the porxies. The knowledge will come in handy for treating levin sickness, as well."

91,"TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_ERENVILLE_000_061","You needn't have trekked all the way out here, but it is good to see you. Alisaie gave us the broad strokes, and Koana had some choice words as well."
