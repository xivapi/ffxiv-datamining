The moment you lay eyes upon it, the Archive claims to have recalled all that he once knew pertaining to his discovery. Having thus unlocked a portion of his sealed knowledge, he explains that the crystal─a soul shard─affords the bearer access to the martial techniques and arcane arts of eld, and insists you affix it to your garb."
