107,"TEXT_KINGMI107_05370_YSHTOLA_000_141","As for us, we've been ahead to inspect the lay of the land. There were no changes of note...aside from with the Meso Terminal itself."

109,"TEXT_KINGMI107_05370_YSHTOLA_000_143","The wall has receded to provide a convenient entrance into the structure's interior. There was no such ingress when last we were here, so we must assume that Calyx has since manipulated the terminal's electrope."
