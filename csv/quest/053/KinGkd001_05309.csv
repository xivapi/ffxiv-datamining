1,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_01","At High Tide Harbor you meet a messenger sent by Ketenramm to find you. He soon fetches the legendary Eorzean explorer, who proceeds to outline his plans for one final voyage─sights firmly set on Shades' Triangle, a fabled and feared stretch of ocean in the Indigo Deep. Convinced that your aid will guarantee the expedition's success, he invites you to join his crew on a journey into the unknown. Having assented, you are to speak with Ofangeim, one of the expedition crew members waiting on the pier."
2,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_02","Ofangeim, the ship's navigator, informs you that the treacherous storms Shades' Triangle is famed for will briefly subside, leaving calm seas and perfect sailing conditions in their wake. Gesturing to the skiff moored nearby, she explains that the main vessel is waiting beyond the shallows, and bids you report to her when ready."
3,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_03","After making the necessary preparations for the voyage ahead, you speak with Ofangeim and set off for seas uncharted..."
4,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_04","On board the expedition vessel, Ketenramm reveals that the stormy waters of Shades' Triangle conceal a strange, crescent-shaped island, the sight of which is said to spell certain doom for all who sail too close. Listening to his explanation, it is clear that such cautionary tales have had quite the opposite effect on the veteran sailor. Still malms away from your destination, Ketenramm suggests you get to know the crew risking their lives alongside you on this perilous adventure.

※In the event that you leave the ship, you may resume your journey by speaking with the expedition ferryman at High Tide Harbor."
5,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_05","You meet the crew and hear their motivations for joining the expedition─not to mention a curious account of a wayward weaponsmith currently languishing in the ship's hold. Ketenramm is no doubt curious to hear your impressions of the crew."
6,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_06","Ketenramm announces that the ship will soon enter Shades' Triangle. The crew assume their positions, steeled for the final approach."
7,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_07","As the crew contend with the island vanishing and reappearing at will, you hear a voice ring out over the waves, beckoning you onward. Shortly after, the ship lurches violently, seized by some arcane power as blinding light engulfs the vessel. As the white pall dissipates, you find yourselves docked at the island's crumbling stone pier. The ship is unscathed but locked firmly in place─perhaps held by the same force that transported you and the crew to these shores. For his part, Ketenramm is quietly pleased about the prospect of being trapped on the isle, and ventures forth with a grin.

※Should you leave the Occult Crescent, you will be able to return via High Tide Harbor whenever you wish to rejoin the expedition."
8,"TEXT_KINGKD001_05309_SEQ_08","You gather by the entrance to a walled settlement nestled above the dock. Expecting the island to be uninhabited, Ketenramm is intrigued to find signs of civilization, albeit seemingly long absent. No doubt this will be but the first of myriad mysteries awaiting you once the expedition gets underway."
