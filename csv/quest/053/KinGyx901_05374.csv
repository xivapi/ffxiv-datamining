Before he and his fellow hunters could begin a proper investigation, however, they received an unusual mark bill for a beast they believe to be responsible. Knowing of your exploits in felling Valigarmanda, they can think of no one better to aid them in seeking out this quarry. You agree to assist, and the tracker bids you speak with their equally unusual client, who should be near the tavern in Hhusatahwi."
2,"TEXT_KINGYX901_05374_SEQ_02","As you scan the dusty roads of Hhusatahwi, your eyes fall upon a curiously clad, feline-esque creature─its visage vaguely matching the tracker's description. The self-described “Felyne” entreats your aid in hunting a monster known as Guardian Arkveld, who has been disrupting the ecosystem of Shaaloani. Having agreed to lend your aid, the Felyne explains to you how they and their quarry arrived in these lands. With you now brought up to speed, your fuzzy friend sets off towards the town's exit, clearly expecting you to follow."
3,"TEXT_KINGYX901_05374_SEQ_03","The stray Felyne asks that you take the lead in searching the plains of Shaaloani for traces of Arkveld, given your greater knowledge of the area. You find the request reasonable enough, and so you happily oblige.

Your Felyne friend bids you collect samples to aid in tracking the beast by scent. To that end, they introduce you to their companion: a creature known as a Seikret, possessed of a keen sense of smell. Once it has taken in Arkveld's scent, all that remains is for you to climb onto its back and begin your pursuit."
7,"TEXT_KINGYX901_05374_SEQ_07","You begin your expedition, conversing with your Felyne companion as you roam the wilds, until at last you happen upon the remains of an animal. The beast is largely intact, showing no signs of predation, leading the Felyne to believe it was felled by Guardian Arkveld. Before they can explain further, however, a disturbance in the distance draws your attention. Turning towards the sound, you find that what the stray Felyne colorfully describes as a “turf war” has broken out between Guardian Arkveld and the Serpentlord Ttokrrone. Without delay, you rush to the scene and hurl a dung pod at the two monsters, inciting Ttokrrone to flee. Arkveld appears to then take your measure before making its own departure. Having seen the direction it fled, you and your Felyne companion regroup to plan your next steps."

10,"TEXT_KINGYX901_05374_SEQ_10","The Felyne stresses that one does not simply embark on a hunt on an empty stomach, and thus urges you to grill meat and eat your fill ere you face your silvery foe. With aplomb, you do as told. Newly invigorated, you feel ready to take on anything."

Rather than despair, however, the Felyne is eager to explore what the continent of Tural has to offer, hoping to find a means of return in the process. Yet before setting off on a new adventure, the Felyne insists on informing the Dawn Hunt tracker that the threat has been eliminated, and so the two of you make for Tuliyollal."
14,"TEXT_KINGYX901_05374_SEQ_14","Informing the Dawn Hunt tracker of Guardian Arkveld's demise, the Felyne is inspired to ask whether the scales you carved from the fiend's hide might be used to craft equipment. As fortune would have it, the nearby smithy can do just that─and more, should you provide the requisite materials. Amid this discovery, the Felyne's feathered companion appears, seemingly eager to remain by your side. Your friend is happy to let the Seikret follow its heart, and now intends to follow their own. Bidding you farewell, the Felyne sets off on a grand adventure to find their way home. Should the mood for monster hunting strike again, any scales you pry from Guardian Arkveld will earn you rich rewards from the smithy."
