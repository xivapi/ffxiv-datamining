1,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_01","Inspector's Log:
No sooner did I emerge from a thirty-year slumber than I found myself at the heart of a mystery most diabolical: the Case of the Fiendish Fugitives! A secretive researcher has been imbuing monsters with the souls of criminals, who are then set loose in Alexandria to commit their favored felony. With the cooperation of the surly-if-well-meaning Detective Hardiboiled─whom I feel compelled to reiterate resembles me not in the slightest─we were able to apprehend one such villain, an eyeclops with an eye for larceny. Though the fugitive knew naught of the researcher's grand scheme, it is only a matter of time─and the investigative genius of Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville─ere all is brought before the light of gentlemanly justice!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Hardiboiled has extracted more data from the storage device recovered from Yuweyawata, identifying a new fugitive-turned-fiend for your crew to pursue. The criminal in question has assumed the form of a cauahealoa, a bipedal wolf, and it is believed that it will be committing acts of wanton vandalism, for which it had earned notoriety as a man. While the fiend is like to avoid densely populated areas, for want of other leads, Hardiboiled suggests calling on one of his trusted sources, a man named Mymond. Setting aside the similarity to a certain information broker in Ul'dah for now, you make your way across the recreation zone to meet with the individual."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_02","In a development that would perhaps be amazing were it not but another of the countless curiosities you have experienced in the presence of Inspector Hildibrand, Mymond turns out to be the spitting image of Wymond. From the purveyor of information, you learn that a cauahealoa has been sighted entering yet not emerging from Vanguard. Furthermore, its mannerisms marked it as more man than beast. This is enough to convince Hardiboiled that your target has gone to Shaaloani, and you and companions set off for the barrier's exit."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_03","During your passage through Vanguard, Hardiboiled betrays an irrational fear for oglops when he loses his characteristic cool in an encounter with the verminous insects. Your timely provision of a boiled egg thankfully suffices for him to regain composure, and you continue on to Shaaloani without further incident."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_04","Upon arriving in Shaaloani, Hardiboiled proposes that you begin by gathering information in settlements. Sheshenewezi Springs lies a short distance to the south, and it is there that your crew first makes its way."
5,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_05","You and your companions split up to question the people of Sheshenewezi Springs about acts of vandalism in the area. Such incidents would serve to confirm the presence of your fugitive."
6,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_06","Through your inquiries, you have learned that there has been a spate of vandalism targeting equipment and barns. Though the Dustwatch has no lead as yet, the culprit is believed to be an outsider. Armed with this knowledge, you go to seek out Hardiboiled."
7,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_07","You report your findings to Hardiboiled, who says that he has heard much the same. When Hildibrand then wonders after Nashu's whereabouts, Hardiboiled expresses his exasperation before proposing that you split up to search for the inspector's absent-minded assistant."
8,"TEXT_CHRHDB931_05378_SEQ_08","At the outskirts of Sheshenewezi Springs, you find Nashu being accosted by ruffians who, having seen her polishing her “medicine,” wish to take her in as the wanted vandal. As the confrontation heats up, Hardiboiled challenges the leader to settle matters the old-fashioned way, and the two subsequently square off for a duel in the middle of town. With his superior experience and skill, Hardiboiled gets the better of his brash young opponent before further dodging a spray of bullets from the remaining ruffians. The commotion draws out Kemakka, who deems Hardiboiled innocent for his part in an unlawful gunfight, but when Hildibrand accidentally ignites one of Nashu's Delights in his presence, the sheriff decides to arrest her as a vandal suspect. As his assistant is led away in shackles, the inspector manages to extricate himself from the ground in time to swear that he will clear her name."
