She is determined to go forward with the Pact immediately, and honors you with the task of getting a barrel of the libation from the kirkahryar house and placing it on the Breathless Altar.

After a few tense moments, the spirit begins to speak in a calm voice.

While the stone monuments are usually engraved with symbols which tell the stories of their subject, Fahrafahr is aware that the spirits likely cannot read them.
