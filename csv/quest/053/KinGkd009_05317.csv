69,"TEXT_KINGKD009_05317_ARCHIVE_000_025","Precisely. This island's architect─it was he who foresaw catastrophe and sought to preserve a facet of each nation with these empty monuments."

If it was our architect that raised the isle's voidsent, he too may have followed the practice."
73,"TEXT_KINGKD009_05317_ARCHIVE_000_029","A dangerous gambit, to be sure, I believe obtaining such a contract will be our best shot at identifying him. Should you find and dispatch a voidsent, keep your eyes peeled."
