※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_KINGKW103_05382_SEQ_01","With Gerolt exuding aetheric energies, all that remains is to procure raw materials to begin the enhancement process. Thankfully, it appears the survey team have managed to extract a sizable quantity of waxing arcanite, which will be necessary to refine your phantom weapon. Given ongoing contractual obligations to the House of Splendors, however, you will need to purchase the requisite three chunks of ore from Ermina, their mercantile representative on the isle. Dodokkuli, meanwhile, waits patiently by the smithy, ready to receive the ore for preliminary processing.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.

※Chunks of waxing arcanite can be obtained from Ermina in the phantom village."

Eager to behold Gerolt's newfound forging potential, he swiftly completes preparations before passing the reins to the aether-rich weaponsmith. Gerolt draws upon the wellspring of energy within him, successfully emulating the ancient art of aetheric infusion and thus completing this phase of the refinement process. You hold your enhanced phantom weapon aloft, ready to test its true potential on the battlefield."
