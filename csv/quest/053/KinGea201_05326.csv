1,"TEXT_KINGEA201_05326_SEQ_01","There has been another sighting of what the Landsguard believe to be echoes in Yak T'el. Realizing the threat they pose to Tural, Bakool Ja Ja has already set off to confront them, and your assistance has been requested. The last sighting was reported by Toraal Ja in Mamook. Perhaps they can tell where in Yak T'el you can find Bakool Ja Ja."
2,"TEXT_KINGEA201_05326_SEQ_02","Toraal Ja informs you that Bakool Ja Ja was hunting for the echoes somewhere to the north of Gok Draak Descent when last they spoke, and he was ordered to escort you there. He asks that you climb aboard his mount when you are ready to set off."

Amidst their remains, however, you find a letter penned by Sareel Ja. His preparations for your next trial are complete, and he invites you to return to Jeuno. Not wishing to risk further attacks from potentially greater echoes, you accept his invitation and make for Jeuno."
4,"TEXT_KINGEA201_05326_SEQ_04","After a brief wait, Sareel Ja makes his dramatic entrance, the Shade of Resolve by his side. He boasts of his visions of grandeur, confident his plans will succeed with the help of a newly created echo─Kam'lanaut, the Archduke of the Grand Duchy of Jeuno. Prishe steps forward to exchange words, but he has grown tired of her meddling, and attempts to strike her down. Surprisingly, Bakool Ja Ja pushes her out of harm's way, though he is injured in the process. Prishe elects to stay behind and tend to his wounds, leaving you and Alxaal to brave the dangers ahead."
5,"TEXT_KINGEA201_05326_SEQ_05","You step through a portal and find yourself in yet another unfamiliar city, danger lurking around every corner.

6,"TEXT_KINGEA201_05326_SEQ_06","Sareel Ja congratulates you on your victory, though you can see little cause for celebration. Prishe believes his bravado in the wake of defeat is all bluster, but he assures her that his plans proceed apace. Indeed, the wheels in his mind already appear to be turning toward a new selection of echoes. He takes his leave once more, leaving you to wonder what schemes he might unfurl when next he appears."
7,"TEXT_KINGEA201_05326_SEQ_07","Despite the events of the day, Alxaal's resolve to stop Sareel Ja remains unshaken. Prishe's, perhaps, less so. Unfortunately, there is naught to be done save bide your time and prepare for the next inevitable confrontation. "
