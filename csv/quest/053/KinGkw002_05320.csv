0,"TEXT_KINGKW002_05320_SEQ_00","Lydirceil is eager for Gerolt to bring his plans to fruition.
※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_KINGKW002_05320_SEQ_01","You approach Lydirceil, having resolved to seek the new heights of perfection promised by Gerolt's phantom weapons. Although the crew have unearthed a sizable quantity of the raw materials required, Lydirceil informs you of a somewhat knotty contractual agreement to the House of Splendors. Any and all resources obtained during the expedition are apparently the property of Rowena, which will entail a significant outlay on your part to purchase the necessary arcanite. Conveniently, Rowena's mercantile representative, Ermina, stands at the ready to do business. Mere strides away awaits Dodokkuli, a metallurgist assisting with preparations in Gerolt's stead.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_KINGKW002_05320_SEQ_02","Stock of tomestones greatly diminished, you deliver the three chunks of arcanite to Dodokkuli. The metallurgist dutifully prepares the ore before entrusting the remaining work to Gerolt, who puts demiatma-infused hammer to anvil and completes the process. The result is every bit the “pinnacle o' weapon fabrication” the master artisan claims it to be, and will no doubt prove an exquisite companion in future encounters with fiends great and small alike."
