※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_01","On Emerald Avenue, you encounter an effusive fellow spreading word of the Gold Saucer festivities. Having caught your attention, he shares news of a rumor regarding the venerated Triple Triad player, King Elmer III. He stops short of sharing any pertinent details, however, instead directing you to speak with Ollier the attendant in Card Square should this tidbit have piqued your interest.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_02","As the attendant begins to expound on the matter, King Elmer III himself appears and reveals that the rumor concerns his skills, or supposed lack thereof, at the Triple Triad table. Fearing the deleterious impact on the king's reputation and reverberations among both past and potential challengers, Ollier seeks to discern the source of the rumor and tasks you with gathering information in Wonder Square."
3,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_03","Having spoken with three patrons, it seems the rumor is not widely believed and that King Elmer III enjoys the support of some very ardent fans. However, reported sightings of the card champion wandering the Saucer may warrant further inquiry. You make for the aetheryte plaza to share your findings with Ollier."
4,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_04","Given that King Elmer III has remained faithfully at his post, the attendant is alarmed by the reports of an errant king. The simplest explanation: an impostor is frequenting the squares and hallways of the Gold Saucer. Keen to locate the pretender, Ollier enlists your help in surveying the glittering vastness of Event Square."
5,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_05","In the distance, you glimpse a green-robed individual lose a game of Triple Triad in dramatic fashion. On approach, the man declares himself to be King Elmer III and challenges you to a match, but turns tail and flees when he notices Ollier's stern gaze. As the attendant dutifully dashes off in pursuit, you spot something laying on the red carpet mere ilms away from where the impostor was standing."
6,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_06","The object in question reveals itself as a Triple Triad card emblazoned with King Elmer III. You carefully stow the card and move to reconvene with Ollier, who may be able to shed light on its provenance."
7,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_07","According to the ever-professional attendant, the card is a limited-edition print─one of several commissioned as gifts for King Elmer III's adoring supporters. Surmising that the impostor himself is one such fan, you resolve to lure the false king out of hiding by using the card as bait. You are to wait by the main counter, ready to leap into action when your mark appears to collect his precious lost property."
8,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_08","After a daring chase and with the aid of the true King Elmer III, the pretender is surrounded. He confesses that he assumed the king's identity in order to feel stronger, a charade that spun wildly out of control. Far from excoriating the misguided fellow, King Elmer shares his own struggles as a Triple Triad player, offering advice on how to improve and ultimately inviting his doppelganger to face him fair and square─not as an impostor, but as an accomplished player in his own right. At any rate, with the false king repentant, the rumor ought not spread further. No doubt Ollier will wish to thank you for your efforts."
9,"TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_09","The grateful attendant gifts you a limited-edition King Elmer III card as a token of appreciation for your assistance in quelling the rumor. He bids you make the most of the Gold Saucer's ongoing festivities─particularly those of the Triple Triad variety, if the fancy strikes."
