The snow spirits, as well, seem to have come to an understanding of the Yok Huy perspective on death, and now look forward to new friendships that will endure generations. The living sepulchres stand as testament to this fellowship, and as the days come and go, they will surely be filled with stories of joy shared between the Yok Huy and the spirits of the snowy mountains."
