2,"TEXT_BANYOK004_05333_SEQ_02","Fahrafahr reads Dartorgor's living sepulchre for you, which starts with the story of her ancestors and the first Pact. Apparently the spirits are partial to a corn liquor called kirkahryar, which has been the centerpiece of the ritual for generations. This makes apparent the purpose of the corn Dartorgor used as currency, and Fahrafahr decides to speak with Kurbulur to see how viable it would be to make kirkahryar on the mountain. You follow the eager Yok Huy to the larder."
3,"TEXT_BANYOK004_05333_SEQ_03","As luck would have it, Kurbulur tells you that a ruined building was but recently discovered. He surmises it was once the very place where kirkahryar was produced, and Fahrafahr decides to make its restoration a priority. The stone golem would make the task much easier, but its viability as a tool is yet to be determined.

The ancient construct comes to life, and with its aid both the brewery and altar are restored to their former glory. Zirgorteh the Open-armed is now as pristine as in the days Dartorgor and her kin lived there, and all that is left is to wait for the kirkahryar to finish fermenting before the Pact can begin."
