1,"TEXT_KINGKW102_05381_SEQ_01","With the vessels glazed and ready, the trying task of filling them through ferocious combat lies ahead. According to Gerolt, the isle's unstable ambient aether is ill-suited to the endeavor, and instead recommends you strike out for battlefields distant and multifarious. Each aetherwell can be replenished via a different Duty Roulette category:

Green: High-level Dungeons
Blue: Alliance Raids
Red: Trials
Yellow: Normal Raids

You may use the aetherwell array to gauge how much aether has been accumulated.

※Speak to Gerolt if you wish to abandon this quest."
2,"TEXT_KINGKW102_05381_SEQ_02","After an endless succession of hard-fought battles, the aetherwells are full. You deliver them to Gerolt, who soon performs the necessary preparations and channels the abundance of energy into his very being. The ancient art of “aetheric bleedin' infusion” thus absorbed, the cantankerous craftsman is almost ready to turn his attention to the phantom weapons themselves. What hitherto unimagined heights of refinement await?"
