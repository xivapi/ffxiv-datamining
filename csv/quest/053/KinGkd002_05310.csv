56,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_SYSTEM_000_103","Judging from their orientation, the vessels must have sunk while attempting to leave the island. There is no telling whether the souls on board were also lost to the waves."

61,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_KETENRAMM_000_201","Lookin' at these structures, I'd say this settlement's ancient. The original inhabitants may be long gone, but I was half hopin' to find a few survivors from the wrecks at the very least."

82,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_KETENRAMM_000_216","I'm Ketenramm, an explorer hailin' from Limsa Lominsa. We're here on an expedition backed by the nation of Tuliyollal."

86,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_KETENRAMM_100_219","If memory serves, such a plague swept the realm at the end of the Fifth Astral Era... But that'd mean ye've been asleep for more than one thousand five hundred years."
87,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_ARCHIVE_000_220","That would explain why I feel so well rested. Now that I'm awake, I should very much like to see what has become of the isle..."
88,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_ARCHIVE_000_221","I certainly don't recall the memorial fountain being so begrimed with algae. Perhaps you do speak the truth."
89,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_ARCHIVE_000_222","And this strange aether I sense pervading the island... Could it be a ward of sorts?"
90,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_ARCHIVE_000_223","Hmph. The noggin's still foggy after that eons-long slumber."
91,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_ARCHIVE_000_224","There was a time when I knew all kinds of things─the name of every battle, the weight of all the riches in the world to the onze! I was a wise old man, a gushing font of knowledge!"
92,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_ARCHIVE_000_225","Say, I could be a real boon for your expedition once I get up to speed... I shall join you on your endeavors!"

95,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_A2_000_002","Perhaps in the course of our adventure, your memories will come flooding back."
96,"TEXT_KINGKD002_05310_KETENRAMM_000_227","Seein' as there's nothing in this settlement out to kill us, I think it's time we get the crew ashore an' earnin' their keep."
