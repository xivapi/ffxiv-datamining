1,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_SEQ_01","Sareel Ja is once again beyond your reach, leaving you and your companions little recourse save to return home and prepare for your next encounter. Vexed though he is by your present predicament, Bakool Ja Ja understands the futility of his idle rantings. And so, he suggests that you all reconvene at Brightploom Post."
2,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_SEQ_02","Before Sareel Ja elected to show himself, Prishe and Alxaal were taking in the sights of Tural, hopeful of discovering some hint as to the nature of electrope. An admirable mission, but one that Bakool Ja Ja explains is ultimately futile without venturing to the source of electrope─Alexandria. To help further their investigation, Bakool Ja Ja contacts Oblivion, who express a keen interest in meeting Alxaal and Prishe. In fact, they suggest a meeting on the outskirts of Alexandria. To that end, the four of you prepare to set off, first making a stop at Sheshenewezi Springs."
3,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_SEQ_03","No sooner do you arrive at Sheshenewezi Springs than you're approached by a distressed Eldite man looking for his daughter. Prishe claims to have seen a girl matching her description somewhere to the south. With time remaining before your meeting with Oblivion, you agree to help look for her. Together with Alxaal and Prishe, you make for a nearby settlement to the south, hopeful the residents there have seen the wayward young girl."
4,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_SEQ_04","Though most have seen neither hide nor hair of Jasper's daughter, one worker spotted her just outside the settlement not long ago. Perhaps Alxaal has good news to share."
5,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_SEQ_05","Alxaal has also heard tell of a girl seemingly lost, wandering about south of the settlement. He wastes no time rushing off in search of her."
6,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_SEQ_06","In catching up with Alxaal, you also happen upon Prishe. While contending with local scalekin, she says she spied what may have been Scoria nearby. Your search appears to be drawing to an end."

57,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_ALXAAL_000_103","We happened upon a most fascinating settlement of giants on our travels. The Yok Huy, I believe they called themselves. They bear a striking resemblance to the Trolls of our world."

66,"TEXT_KINGEA202_05327_PRISHE_000_112","Ah, right. I've heard stories about adventurers struggling to get a pass for the airships in Vana'diel. I'd sooner walk if I had to pay those prices."
