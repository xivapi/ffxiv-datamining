1,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_SEQ_01","You convene with the Archive and Ketenramm in the deserted plaza. As the tonberry ponders why his slumber went uninterrupted for so many years, a faerie floats forth and shares a curious revelation. She claims that whatever knowledge the Archive once possessed has been sealed away, and more bafflingly, that his present memory is somehow linked to the things you yourself have seen and learned. As the faerie leaves─the group none the wiser as to who summoned her, or indeed her purpose─the Archive notes that she is wreathed in the same aether permeating the isle. Discovering the identity of her master may shed light on how Shades' Triangle came to be. As the mysteries proliferate, Ketenramm is determined to forge on with the expedition, and bids you speak with Jeffroy who has been tasked with establishing a base camp on the isle."
2,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_SEQ_02","Jeffroy apprises you of the crew's progress scouting the south horn of the island. With the advance party already working to establish a base camp, the Hyur asks that you let him know when you are ready to begin your excursion."

51,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_011","So this isle lies in the heart of “Shades' Triangle,” and many a ship has gone missing in these waters?"
52,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_012","You mentioned the wrecks out in the bay─it's not unreasonable to think some of those sailors would have made it ashore. Why did no one try to wake me?"

54,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_A1_000_001","They probably took one look at you and sealed the sarcophagus back up."

58,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_100_013","I might be old, but I'm swift and sprightly. I'd have been up and about in a flash if they so much as shifted the coffin lid!"
59,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_014","But your burly companion was able to force the lock. I daresay younger, swarthier sailors would have even less trouble getting that door open."
60,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_015","You mean to imply that someone summoned you here?"
61,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_016","Clearly, it wasn't me. I've been sound asleep for the last few millennia, give or take."

64,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_018","Hm? What manner of creature is this?"
65,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_KETENRAMM_000_019","A familiar, methinks. Looks like the faeries employed by Nymian scholars of eld. Was it you who summoned her?"
66,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_020","Me? Preposterous! I would have summoned something more...statuesque."
67,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_IRIS_000_021","How rude! My name is Iris, and I certainly wasn't called forth by a wizened little wretch like you."
68,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_022","W-Wizened!? You mean “wise,” you petulant little whelp! Honestly, who would ever summon a companion so lacking in manners?"
69,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_IRIS_000_023","I know exactly what I meant, and <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>, sir, are lacking in wisdom. A seal has been placed upon your worldly knowledge, thus preventing its use."

71,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_024","Is that so? Well, that explains why I can't muster the faintest mote of magic. I tried to heal myself earlier, to no avail. Centuries of sleep on that cold stone slab really took its toll on my lower back..."

76,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_029","Ahem. I'll tell you one thing: that faerie was steeped in the same aether permeating the island."
77,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_100_029","As I surmised, there's a strange ward covering the isle in its entirety. No doubt those ships in the bay were caught in its pull."
78,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_KETENRAMM_000_030","Well, wards can't just cast themselves. Meaning someone's responsible for those poor souls who perished in Shades' Triangle..."
79,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_KETENRAMM_000_031","Methinks our focus ought to be findin' out what we can about this individual. An' let's not forget that strange voice you keep hearin'─for all we know, it could be connected in some way."
80,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_KETENRAMM_000_032","Right, let's go speak with Jeffroy over yonder. He ought to have word on progress at the base camp."

82,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_040","A fellow back pain sufferer, are you? The spell I tried to cast is called “Spinal Zap.” Some say it's the finest example of white magic to ever grace the pages of an arcane tome."
83,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_ARCHIVE_000_041","Hmph. I couldn't even recall the name of that spell before. Am I remembering it now because <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> heard me speak of trying to cure my aches and pains? My poor noggin─this is all so perplexing..."
84,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_JEFFROY_000_100","You'll be pleased to hear that preparations are well underway─I sent the advance party to scout ahead while the ship's being unloaded."

86,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_JEFFROY_000_102","When you're ready to head out, just say the word. Once you're out in the field, you'll have to speak with Ketenramm and decide how to proceed."
87,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_JEFFROY_000_103","The support crew will be stationed here in town. Be sure to avail yourself of their services if you're in need."
88,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_JEFFROY_000_104","And if you're after a weaponsmith, word is we hired a truly remarkable craftsman for the expedition. Judging by his reputation, he'll soon have your weapons honed to deadly perfection."
89,"TEXT_KINGKD003_05311_JEFFROY_000_105","The smithy'll be set up over yonder. Do drop by if you're interested."
