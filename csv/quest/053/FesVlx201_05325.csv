※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLX201_05325_SEQ_01","Astrid and Emilie tell you of their plans to serve giant cakes to guests at the Valentione's Day celebrations. A plan that has apparently hit a snag in cake production. Emissaries of love were dispatched to assess the situation at the pâtisserie and should be returning ere long. To that end, Astrid and Emilie invite you to meet them at the entrance to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."

And yet, Astrid cannot help but wonder what possessed the mammets to turn their ire on the pâtissiers. It seems as though Kupka Kupp may have an inkling."
5,"TEXT_FESVLX201_05325_SEQ_05","Upon closer observation, Kupka Kupp noticed traces of moogle magicks upon the mammets. The only other moogle who entered the pâtisserie should have been Kupna Kuko, who helped procure the fruit for the cakes. Kupka suggests asking him for further information, with your intimidating presence to help loosen any hesitant tongues. Giving your assent, you begin the search for Kupna Kuko by the Lancers' Guild."
6,"TEXT_FESVLX201_05325_SEQ_06","Kupna Kuko admits that the entire incident was a misguided attempt to help, with the moogle magicks intended to compel the mammets to work harder instead leading to dangerous malfunction. With the issue resolved─and Kupna Kuko suitably abashed─the group heads back to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to get the celebrations underway."
