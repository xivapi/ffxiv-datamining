48,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_UYARGUR_000_001","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I have a favor to ask of you. I had sent someone to Icuvlo's Inn to replenish our larder, but she is rather late to return."
49,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_UYARGUR_000_002","I fear she may have encountered some manner of trouble on the road. I would be grateful if you could search for her."
50,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_005","Oh dear, Vuyargur asked you to find me? I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to make him worry."
51,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_006","I'd heard that a feast was to be held for the snow spirits, you see, and I wanted to serve up something that they might enjoy with the kirkahryar."
52,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_007","But I couldn't think of anything, and the time got away... Would you happen to have any ideas?"
53,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_008","I wanted to provide a treat for the spirits again─something different and new. But I couldn't think of anything, and the time got away... Would you happen to have any ideas?"
54,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
55,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_A1_000_001","How about another variety of liquor?"
56,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_A1_000_002","How about sweets prepared with ice?"
57,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_A1_000_003","There's no knowing the spirits' tastes."
58,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_009","Ah, so something that offers contrast. In which case, the Pelupelu's mezcal may be suitable."
59,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_010","The taste is rather different from kirkahryar, but perhaps some snow spirits will enjoy it."
60,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_011","Ah, of course, it stands to reason that snow spirits would prefer cold things."
61,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_012","In which case, perhaps I could freeze some flowers and fruits in a bed of ice. That would be both pretty and palatable, I daresay."
62,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_013","It's true, there's still much that we don't know about the spirits... That's why I spent so much time pondering it to no avail."
63,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_014","Perhaps by simply enjoying the occasion ourselves, we would make it more enjoyable for them. In which case, something that we ourselves like would be suitable."
64,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_015","Yes, the more I think on it, the more I feel confident in that approach. It will make for a wonderful banquet, I'm sure of it!"
65,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_SHOPPINGYOK05363_000_016","I'm much obliged for your guidance. Please assure Vuyargur that I'll be back as soon as I have what I need."

68,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_UYARGUR_000_021","So that is the way of it... I'm glad to hear that she was safe."
69,"TEXT_BANYOK128_05363_UYARGUR_000_022","And thanks to your sage counsel, she was able to arrive at an answer to her dilemma. I shall look forward to seeing what she acquires for the snow spirits."
