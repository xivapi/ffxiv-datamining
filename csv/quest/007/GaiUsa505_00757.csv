1,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_SEQ_01","In light of your run-in with an Ala Mhigan bandit, Hihibaru recommends that you next take your investigation to Little Ala Mhigo. His daughter, a lass named Hihira, has taken up residence there, and should be able to lend you a hand."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_SEQ_02","Hihira has no knowledge of Lahabrea. She recommends you speak with a man named Gundobald, the leader of the refugee settlement."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_SEQ_03","As forewarned, you receive a cold welcome from Gundobald. It seems that some effort will be required on your part if the residents of Little Ala Mhigo are to warm to you."
