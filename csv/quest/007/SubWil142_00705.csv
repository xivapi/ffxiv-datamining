1,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_SEQ_01","Nedrick has introduced you to Rowena, an artifact collector who has set up shop at Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhona. If you are serious about your equipment, he recommends paying her a visit."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_SEQ_02","Rowena tells you about a weaponsmith of no small repute named Gerolt, who she claims is skilled in the restoration of ancient relics. Find Gerolt at Hyrstmill in the North Shroud, and show him the promise of payment that Rowena has given you."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_SEQ_03","You meet and speak with Gerolt. Shamelessly exploiting the prodigious debt he owes Rowena, you coerce the man into lending you his expertise in the restoration of a relic weapon. Do as Gerolt directs if you wish to become the proud owner of a legendary arm of yore."

51,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_ROWENA_060_000","A friend o' Nedrick's, are you? Then you must be an adventurer o' some skill. My business relies on capable people such as you. As a gesture o' goodwill, I'm goin' to share with you a morsel of information."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_ROWENA_000_000","There's this bloke named Gerolt. Makes his livin' in weapons and armor and whatnot. They say his skill is the finest in all the realm.

54,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_ROWENA_000_002","Aye, I've known Gerolt ever since I landed in this business. Ain't seen him for a while, though. And the last time I <Emphasis>did</Emphasis>, the ol' fool had tears in his eyes and snot drippin' from his nose. “Fallen on hard times,” he said. Asked for a bit o' coin to tide him over. Never paid me back, neither."
55,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_ROWENA_000_003","Couldn't say for sure where he is now. Seem to remember hearin' he was in the Black Shroud, puttin' up at Hyrstmill or some such place. You might do well to commission his work. He'll even reforge the relics of old if you make it worth his while, and there ain't no other in Eorzea as can do that."
