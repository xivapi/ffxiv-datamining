1,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_SEQ_01","Jalzahn is perplexed as to why such a priceless resource as the Book of Netherdark never came to light alongside the other Trials of the Braves. He wishes to learn more of the tome's origins for his own erudition, and asks that you accompany him to question Gerolt. Speak with the blacksmith, and help the alchemist solve this lingering mystery."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_SEQ_02","Upon consulting Gerolt, you learn that it was Jalzahn's ancient forefather who penned the Book of Netherdark. Moreover, you discover that the author left as his legacy the title of “Starforger” to the person who could succeed in fully recreating a legendary arm of yore. Gerolt and Jalzahn, both desirous of this, allow their pride to tear them apart. Speak with Jalzahn now, to discover if the matter has been resolved."
3,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_SEQ_03","Unable to decide who should be crowned “Starforger,” Jalzahn has decided to remain in Hyrstmill until Gerolt gives up his claim. However, the alchemist can now continue to aid you with your arm should the need arise. With a fondness in his voice, Jalzahn bids you to go forth, and use your Zodiac Weapon for good and so create your own legend."

50,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_JALZAHN_000_002","One matter puzzles me still, however: why was the Book of Netherdark─a priceless resource─never completed nor circulated?"
51,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_JALZAHN_000_003","If I have learned anything by now, 'tis that Gerolt can shed some light on the matter. Come, my friend, let us make one last journey across the village green─for the sake of knowledge itself!"

58,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_GEROLT_000_052","Eh? Well, Rowena's place, o' course. I came across it while I was pickin' up the rest o' the Trials of the Braves."
59,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_GEROLT_000_053","Rowena said she'd only sell the tome to a collector what'd pay a king's ransom fer it─till I threatened to wed her again, that is. Well, ye can bet she handed it over in a hurry after that, hehe."

63,"TEXT_JOBREL017_00561_GEROLT_000_057","But this Book of Netherdark, well, it's jus' raw facts. Seems like it were added to the set after everythin' else, an' ye can tell that no editor's pen ever touched it. 'Tis really jus' a treatise on the Zodiac Braves."
