48,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_000","Back so soon? Very well, let's resume your training."
49,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_001","Since last we spoke, you will doubtless have spent your time making the basic products of our trade─namely yarn and cloth."
50,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_002","Now I would have you take such basic products and craft whole garments from them. Make three pairs of hempen breeches and present them for my inspection."
51,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_003","You'll be working with hempen cloth and yarn this time, as well as a little bit of leather. Gigima can furnish you with materials to help you get started."
52,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_004","Ah, but eager as I am to see the fruits of your labor, it would be remiss of me not to mention that there are more economical methods of procuring that which you need."
53,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_005","For example, the moko grass from which you have been dutifully making yarn can be freely gathered out in the wilds. That said, one can't simply rip it out of the ground with one's hand─a scythe is needed, as well as a working knowledge of botany."
54,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_006","Have you, perchance, made the acquaintance of a botanist or two? If not, I heartily recommend that you do. They are attractively earthy without seeming dirty, and useful besides."
55,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_007","Having said all of that, I will <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> accept a newfound passion for botany and its practitioners as an excuse for the late delivery of your breeches─so don't keep me waiting!"
56,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_010","I take it the breeches are ready?"
57,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_011","Not bad, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Not bad at all."
58,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_012","This style of legwear has never been particularly fashionable, nor has its design changed significantly over the years─fluctuating lengths aside... But I digress."
59,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_013","I wondered if you might try for a variation on the conventional design, but I see you opted for orthodoxy. A wise decision, in this case."
60,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_014","Hempen clothing is inexpensive and durable, making it popular amongst farmers, miners, and others who work the land."
61,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_015","Such customers value comfort and mobility over all else. They may appreciate more elegant forms, but they will not sacrifice function for them."
62,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_016","Each garment has a purpose, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─a purpose that you should always bear in mind. A scalloped hem is about as useful to a miner as nipples on a gladiator's breastplate."
63,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_017","Now then─having completed your latest task, I believe you have earned this spinning wheel."
64,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_018","Use it in combination with your needle, and your work will benefit from it."
65,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_019","Saying that, it will of course take you a little while to become accustomed to using the tools together. You need not worry, though─I fully intend to give you <Emphasis>ample</Emphasis> opportunity to acquire the knack. In fact, I won't be teaching you anything else until you have!"
66,"TEXT_CLSWVR050_00587_REDOLENTROSE_020","By the time that spinning wheel feels like it belongs in your hand, I daresay I'll have thought of a new task for you. Until then, my <If(PlayerParameter(4))>girl<Else/>boy</If>."
