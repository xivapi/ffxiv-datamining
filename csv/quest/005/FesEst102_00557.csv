She bids you aid in the spriggan's escape, recommending you first have the local sylphic sorceress disguise you in spriggan form, to avoid attracting the brigands' unwelcome attentions."

Nonotta tries to gloss over the unusual exchange, but the air remains heavy with lingering doubt: could the day's commotions have all been a ruse, orchestrated by Nonotta herself?
