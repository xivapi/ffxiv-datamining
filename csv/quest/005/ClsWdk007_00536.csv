1,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_SEQ_01","Gairhard, the Twin Adder captain for whom you crafted a walnut cane, has once again requested your services. Craft an oak longbow of the highest quality and present it to Beatin for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_SEQ_02","Your work elicits nary a complaint from Beatin. Deliver the longbow to Gairhard at the Adders' Nest."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_SEQ_03","Gairhard thanks you for the bow, explaining that his squad cannot compromise on the quality of their equipment, due to the demanding nature of their reconnaissance missions. Unfortunately, it is because of one such mission that Gairhard will once again be unable to visit the Carpenters' Guild in person. Deliver the news to Beatin."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_SEQ_04","Though he understands the responsibilities Gairhard has as a Twin Adder captain, he nevertheless exhibits an uncharacteristic worry upon hearing of his friend's latest mission. Brushing aside his concerns, he states that you will speak again when next he receives a commission for you.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 40."

49,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_BEATINE_000_2","Take that walnut cane, for example. You remember, don't you? The one you crafted not long ago."
50,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_BEATINE_000_3","It must have left quite the impression on Gairhard, because he has once again requested your services."
51,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_BEATINE_000_4","This time, he would have you craft an oak longbow─a <Emphasis>quality</Emphasis> longbow, but I presume you already knew that."
52,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_BEATINE_000_5","Gairhard's squad is considered one of the finest units in the Yellow Serpents. They are oft tasked with dangerous missions which carry them deep into hostile territory."

56,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_BEATINE_000_12","Some carpenters claim that oak is ill-suited for use in longbows, and that other woods are far preferable."
57,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_BEATINE_000_13","But I would say you've chosen your materials well. This particular specimen is both hard and elastic, and I see no reason to believe it will take a permanent bend."
58,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_BEATINE_000_14","Of course, we have <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> to thank for that. The finest materials are nothing without a skilled craftsman to mold them."
