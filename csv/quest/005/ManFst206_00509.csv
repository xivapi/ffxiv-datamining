1,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_SEQ_01","According to Momodi, the men and women who call themselves the Scions of the Seventh Dawn have made it their mission to safeguard Eorzea's future. Given the multitude of problems facing the realm, they are always looking for capable individuals to join their cause, and it appears your recent exploits have drawn their attention. The Scions are headquartered in an establishment called the Waking Sands, located in Vesper Bay, out in western Thanalan. Make your way there and identify yourself to the guardsman at the entrance."
2,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_SEQ_02","At the entrance to the Waking Sands, you find not a guardsman but a singing Lalafell by the name of Tataru, who informs you that the Antecedent awaits within. Let the door guard know when you are ready to be shown through."
3,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_SEQ_03","You meet with Minfilia, the leader of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who expresses her belief that your power─the Echo─is the key to solving the primal problem facing Eorzea. At the end of a lengthy exposition, she implores you to lend your strength to the Scions' cause, and entrusts you with the order's password: “wild rose.”"

Now you know our purpose, and what we can offer you, I invite you to consider joining us. When you have come to a decision, you may tell me without fear of censure."
119,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_61","In good faith, I shall entrust you with our order's password, which our members use to reach one another when afield."
