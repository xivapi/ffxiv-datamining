When you subsequently come to your senses, you are relieved to find that Lady Lilira is safe, and apparently eager to return to the city. Head back to the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard and report all that has occurred to Papashan."
4,"TEXT_MANWIL005_00550_SEQ_04","Papashan explains that the young man was most likely Thancred, a scholar conducting research on aether-related subjects. The stationmaster then thanks you for protecting Lady Lilira and asks that you show that same kindness to the other people of Thanalan."
