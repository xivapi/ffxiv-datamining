50,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_GAGARUNA_000_5","You will find him overseeing his charges yonder. Go now and show to him the fighting spirit that burns within you!"
51,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_GAGARUNA_000_10","Oh? You do not wish to join us, after all? The decision is ultimately yours, but know that few would spurn the opportunity to train under Hamon Holyfist."
52,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_20","Heh heh... Past time you got your arse back here. Well? What did the dancer have to say about my...<Emphasis>proposition</Emphasis>?"
53,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_21","Eh!? Y-You're not my errand boy! There's no dancer─there never was! I'm not doing anything indecent, I swear to the gods!"
54,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_23","...What? You're here to enroll? Ohoho, well, why didn't you say so sooner!? In my capacity as guildmaster, I would be glad to give you a primer on the art of hand-to-hand combat!"
55,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_24","Doubtless you already know this, but we pugilists fight with our fists and feet. While these don't deal as much damage as a blade, it hardly matters when you can land several blows for each swing of the sword. What we lack in destructive force, we more than make up for in speed and cunning. Under my guidance, not only will you master striking techniques..."
56,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_28","You'll also learn to string them together to deliver an endless flurry of blows! Only through such fierce combinations can a pugilist realize his potential! Yaaarrrgh!"
57,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_29","<cough> <wheeze> Crikey, I'm spent from all this talking. You ought to speak more, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>son</If>─it'd give me a chance to catch my breath. But where was I?"
58,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_30","Ah, right. Joining the guild. Before you do so, I must warn you that the path of the pugilist is long and arduous. Do you believe you've got what it takes to go the distance? Be honest with yourself, now!"
59,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_Q1_000_1","Can you go the distance?"

63,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_43","For your first lesson, I want you to test your fledgling skills against the vermin of Thanalan. Get out there and put down three marmots, three hornets, and three shrews. Return here when the deed is done. "
64,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_50","Eh!? You are...shockingly honest, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>son</If>. 'Tis truly a shame you feel unready─I happen to like frankness in my charges."

68,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_63","If you want to become strong, you mustn't neglect your training. Indeed, a pugilist is only as good as the number of strikes he's dealt."
69,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_64","Get out there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and let your fists fly. When the time is ripe, I'll teach you something new."
