7,"TEXT_CLSPGL150_00558_SEQ_07","Beaten and despondent, Hamon admits that the ravages of age have robbed him of his former ability. There seems to be nothing you can do for your guildmaster at the moment. For now, make your way back to the guild, and discuss matters further with Chuchuto."

Determined to help her master and benefactor regain his former strength, she asks for your aid. Keep applying yourself to your training, that your improvement might rekindle the fires of passion within the guildmaster.

※The next pugilist quest will be available from Hamon upon reaching level 20."
