49,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_001","My mewling subordinates have requested that I put aside my personal research “for but a moment or two” and shoulder a portion of the guild's workload, even going so far as to force upon me some other alchemist's petty task."
50,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_002","What fools to think I am the sort of guildmaster that contributes in such a mundane capacity! If they had wanted an accommodating drudge to head the guild, then they should not have elected me to the post!"
51,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_003","Gods know there are others about the Phrontistery who would have been better suited to the leadership position. <sigh> It is times such as these that I curse my blood ties to the Syndicate. I would personally be content to eschew such tedious duties in favor of mine own work."

54,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_010","Mwahaha! Such bliss that my research might progress unhindered by bothersome requests! Speaking of which, have you created the beeswax as I asked?"
55,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_020","Hmmm... These will never be used for the sultana's bedchamber candles, but the quality is passable, I suppose."

58,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_023","Candles are the most obvious use for this refined material, but beeswax may also be used to enhance leather goods, or be mixed with dye to create painting supplies."
