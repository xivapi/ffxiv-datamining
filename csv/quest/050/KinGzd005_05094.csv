49,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_002","Recently I've observed one of the older residents of Iq Br'aax coming and going from the Xobr'it Cinderfield. Quite unusual, since that place is nothing but a barren wasteland, ravaged by war."
50,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_003","Of course, I don't want to be seen prying into private matters, so I can't ask the others about it. But if he's up to no good, I need to know about it. Will you follow him for me?"
51,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_004","He usually makes his regular journey to the cinderfield around this time. Once you find him, stick to his tail─but don't get too close, or else this'll all be for nothing!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_010","Look for an older man near the cinderfield and follow him to his destination. Remember, stealth is the order of the day!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_SYSTEM_000_020","Follow the elderly Xbr'aal from a safe distance. The objective will end in failure if you are noticed, or if you fall too far behind."
54,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_SYSTEM_000_021","Should you fail, return to the starting point to reattempt the objective."
55,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_SYSTEM_000_022","Attempt to follow the elderly Xbr'aal?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_100_030","...All right, no one saw me. I just have to wait until the goods get here. Hmm...maybe I'll be home in time for dinner."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_030","Wha─ Did you follow me here? I guess I wasn't as sneaky as I thought...but I'm not doing anything wrong, despite how this looks."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_031","I'm trading with Mamook, all under the blessing of Hunmu Rruk. We have to be secretive about it, though..."
59,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_032","You see, we deliver valuable foodstuffs to Mamook. Meats and vegetables that're hard to come by in their parts of the woods. In return, we get Ja Tiika bananas. Each party leaves their goods in carts and collects them when the other is out of sight."
60,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_033","For a while after hostilities ceased, trade didn't have to be so cloak-and-dagger. But many of the Mamool Ja who are willing to embrace change have left for Tuliyollal, and those who remain bear old grudges."
61,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_034","So, we chose a path of discretion. Of course, I don't blame the people of Mamook─even in Iq Br'aax, there are those who can't forgive the past. Trading like this appeases both sides, even though our dealings aren't exactly unknown to most."
62,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_035","I take it the one who asked you to follow me was young, yes? Too young to know to overlook an old man wandering into these blasted wastes."
63,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_040","But with relations between us and Mamook finally warming up again, I may not have to do this job for much longer. Clandestine agreements might become open promises of a brighter future."
64,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_MIDDLEAGE05094_000_042","Anyroad, it's time I took my goods and returned home. If you could tell that lass you lost sight of me, I'd be grateful. She'll accept the truth more easily if she discovers it for herself."
65,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_050","You're returned! Did you find out where he was going?"
66,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_CHOICE1Q1_100_060","What will you say?"
67,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_CHOICE1A1_101_060","He was secretly trading with Mamook."
68,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_CHOICE1A2_102_060","He was too quick for me..."
69,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_070","He was? Well, I suppose that explains where all the Ja Tiika bananas come from."
70,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_071","I feel like I should keep his secret. When the days come that we can trade openly, I hope everyone realizes our bond was formed by small threads like these."
71,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_080","Really? Well, these things happen, I suppose. Nevertheless, I thank you for trying. Truth be told, I do have a theory as to what he's up to."
72,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_081","You see, every once in while I'll spot people feasting on Ja Tiika bananas. They never say where they got them from...but if that man is venturing into the lower forest, he could be the one smuggling them."
73,"TEXT_KINGZD005_05094_THOUGHTS05094_000_082","But it's too soon to go around making accusations. I'll keep looking into the matter, and until I find the truth, let's both keep quiet about this, eh?"
