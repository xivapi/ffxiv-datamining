56,"TEXT_KINGZB102_05042_SYSTEM_000_016","The impossibly heavy builder's stone slips from your grasp and craters itself into the earth. Try as you might, you cannot pry it back out again. Return to the brawny Yok Huy to obtain another."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB102_05042_GENTLEYOKFUY05042_000_020","Ah, the builder's stone has arrived at last! I am grateful, of course, but also...confused. How did it end up in your hands?"

59,"TEXT_KINGZB102_05042_GENTLEYOKFUY05042_000_023","Ugh... These stones are miserable to carry, even for us, so I can only assume he tricked you into it somehow. On his behalf, I offer my sincere apologies. "
