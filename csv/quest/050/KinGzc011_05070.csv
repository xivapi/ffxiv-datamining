The Cornservant rustles with excitement at the sight of you."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_SEQ_01","While passing through Ok'hanu, who should you meet but your dear friend the Cornservant. As you expected from their presence, there is a hungry Hanuhanu in the village in need of assistance, and your corny comrade needs help.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_SEQ_02","The hungry Hanuhanu's home was ravaged by a storm, resulting in most of their food spoiling or worse. She has managed to ration what little unspoiled food remains thus far, but hunger tempts her to make a reckless choice. The Cornservant believes what she needs is food with longevity, and so they prepare a bounty of dried corn. The hungry Hanuhanu is moved by the generous offering. She thanks you profusely before leaving to share the good news with her family."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_SEQ_03","Another day, another stomach delivered from the uncertainty of hunger and sickness. But a corn's duty is never done, and so the Cornservant bids you farewell, shucking off once more to parts unknown."

49,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_002","As you might have guessed, there is a Hanuhanu in need of my assistance. And as I yet lack the strength to make myself seen, I am in need of your assistance."
50,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_003","Follow me, and I shall take you to them!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_005","Despite her bright and colorful plumage, her stomach has left her with a rather gloomy disposition."
52,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_HUNGRYHANUHANU05070_000_010","Ugh, my stomach. I can't stand this rationing any longer."
53,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_HUNGRYHANUHANU05070_000_011","My house was flooded in a recent storm, causing most of my food to spoil or rot. I've taken great pains to make what little I have last, but it's simply not enough."
54,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_012","I see. She requires food with longevity. Then she shall have the driest of corns my cob can muster! And...there! This should suffice."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_HUNGRYHANUHANU05070_000_013","My word! Is all this dried corn for me?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_HUNGRYHANUHANU05070_000_014","It will be many moons before I could hope to diminish such a bountiful store. And the crunch is certain to be sublime. Thank you, kind stranger!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_HUNGRYHANUHANU05070_000_015","There is hope for the future yet. Oh, the children will be thrilled!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_020","<rustle> She seemed quite taken with the dried corn. That is well."
59,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_021","I shudder to think what havoc spoiled foods might play on her stomach and bowels. Hunger might well be the least of her problems."
60,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_022","Thanks to your timely assistance, however, she and her family will have all the corn they need to help them weather their hardships."
61,"TEXT_KINGZC011_05070_CORNSERVANT_000_023","Yet there are other empty bellies that beckon, and so I must away. Take care, friend. I hope to see you again."
