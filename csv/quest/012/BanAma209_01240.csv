49,"TEXT_BANAMA209_01240_NARUJIBOH_000_001","Our scout reports that the single ambusher appeared more interested in the trader's cargo─a number of boxes that drew our addled kin's undivided attention. I strongly suspect that only a haul of crystals would outweigh the value of a potential tempered slave."
