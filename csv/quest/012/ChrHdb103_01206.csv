1,"TEXT_CHRHDB103_01206_SEQ_01","According to Wymond, the victim Inspector Hildibrand seeks is a wealthy woman named Yellow Moon. Given her taste for the finer things in life, she can often be found in the Weavers' Guild, being fitted for a new garment. Go and speak with Yellow Moon─with luck, Inspector Hildibrand will not be far behind."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB103_01206_SEQ_02","Serendipitously, Inspector Hildibrand and Nashu arrive at the Weavers' Guild shortly after you, and together you all learn that Yellow Moon's Pure Heart is but one of several items that have been stolen. Unable to determine precisely when and where the perpetrator struck, Inspector Hildibrand proposes that you retrace Yellow Moon's path on the day of the theft. To that end, speak with him outside the Sunsilk Tapestries shop on the Steps of Nald."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB103_01206_SEQ_03","Other than a bizarre incident in which a complete stranger professed his undying love to her, Yellow Moon can recall nothing of note. Proceed to the Coliseum entrance next and see what the wealthy woman remembers."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDB103_01206_SEQ_04","Other than yet another incident in which a complete stranger professed his undying love to her, Yellow Moon states that nothing out of the ordinary occurred. However, her testimony serves to spark something within Inspector Hildibrand, who demands to be left alone whilst he marshals his mental faculties. Respect his wishes and instead speak with Nashu, who appears to be contemplating the three large crates nearby."
5,"TEXT_CHRHDB103_01206_SEQ_05","Nashu is overcome with an unbearable desire to learn the contents of the crates. Unable to discern a simple means of opening them, she proposes destroying them with makeshift explosives of her own design, and even offers to let you do the honors. Though such a reckless and dangerous act is wholly unjustified, she will almost certainly take matters into her own hands if you refuse..."
6,"TEXT_CHRHDB103_01206_SEQ_06","Naught remains of the crates save for their contents: three sweltering, terrified men wearing yellow robes, and Yellow Moon's Pure Heart. It would be prudent to bring this to Inspector Hildibrand's attention."
7,"TEXT_CHRHDB103_01206_SEQ_07","The three men assert that they have followed Yellow Moon only out of a desire to keep her safe, and that the numerous items they stole were instead being kept for safekeeping. This explanation fails to satisfy the enraged woman, who attempts to seize the deviants as they flee for their lives. Inspector Hildibrand congratulates himself on a job well done, and begins to explain how the three men were also responsible for the weapon thefts─only to be corrected by Ellie, a reporter for the <Emphasis>Mythril Eye</Emphasis>, who reminds Inspector Hildibrand that the thief was also a duelist who defeated his victims in single combat. The reporter then offers to divulge the identity of one such victim, for which the inspector is tremendously grateful. However, as before, he neglects to linger long enough to receive the promised information, leaving you alone with Ellie and her exasperation."
