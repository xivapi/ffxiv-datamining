1,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_01","Assuming the role of expedition leader, G'raha Tia issues instructions to the assembled fellowship of NOAH, detailing how the operation will proceed. Make your way to the large gate located to the southeast of Saint Coinach's Find, and await the arrival of the rest of the survey team."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_02","To the great relief of all concerned, the crystal “fangs” make short work of the tower's lethal outer defenses. Reasoning that the structure's inner reaches are like to contain further hazards, Cid volunteers you for the task of securing the Labyrinth of the Ancients. Rid the maze of anything which might pose a threat to the survey team.

※The Labyrinth of the Ancients can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_03","Along with your steadfast adventuring companions, you have succeeded in ridding the labyrinth of its deadly protectors. Cid and G'raha Tia praise your invaluable contribution to the expedition, and together you gaze upon the shimmering spire that rises from the center of the maze."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_04","Though your labors in the labyrinth have secured a route to the tower, much remains to be discussed before the expedition can proceed. Return to Saint Coinach's Find and speak with G'raha Tia."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_05","Back at the excavation site, G'raha Tia invites you to take a moment to collect your thoughts before debating how best to proceed."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_002","Rammbroes, meanwhile, will remain here and oversee the operation. Given my knowledge of Allagan history, it seems logical that I should lead the expedition itself...though I admit the role does not exactly befit my status as an observer."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_003","Still, we can but make use of the resources at hand. Assuming all are in agreement, let us proceed forthwith to the large, lopsided gate found to the southeast."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_013","Lucky for us that it is. One might otherwise stroll past them... Feast your eyes on the elemental defenses which prompted our lengthy preparations. These sentinels prevent would-be intruders from advancing to within twenty yalms of the tower's inner reaches."

68,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_026","We did─and we will. But our investigations must proceed at a more measured pace."
69,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_027","If the outside of the place is this well defended, can you imagine what awaits us on the <Emphasis>inside</Emphasis>? Only a true hero could reasonably hope to brave the hazards ahead and live to tell the tale."
70,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_028","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here fits that description better than anyone I know."
71,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_029","And it is not as if we shall be idle in <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> absence. While <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> companions are risking life and limb to beat us a path to the tower, we can set about analyzing this rubble for evidence of how its technologies function."

74,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_032","Ahem. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─as it seems I won't be accompanying you, allow me at least to provide some instruction. The maze that surrounds the base of the tower is known as the “Labyrinth of the Ancients.” During this initial foray, I suggest you concentrate on ridding the place of hostile elements."
75,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_033","When you are reasonably certain the maze is secure, contact me via linkshell and we shall join you posthaste─no matter what Master Garlond says!"

82,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_045","...A giant of a man wielding a shimmering scimitar, you say? Yes, that will have been Phlegethon. Not Acheron. Phlegethon. He was a hero of the Allagan revolution."
83,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_046","And you gleaned that from what exactly? His choice of weapon?"
84,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_047","Well, I <Emphasis>am</Emphasis> a historian. And I have a certain, shall we say, “affinity” for the lore of the Allagan Empire."
85,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_048","It is, of course, all knowledge gleaned from musty scrolls and tomes. The ancient texts claim that the Crystal Tower is defended by the champions of eld, resurrected and augmented through the Allagans' extraordinary technology."
86,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_BIGGS_000_049","Chief, you need to see this!"
87,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_050","Well, well, there it is...the foot of the tower. What surprises do <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> have in store for us, I wonder...?"
88,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_051","I can't tell you how glad I am to have you with us on this little jaunt, old friend. Had you not beaten a path through that maze, I very much doubt we'd be standing here now..."
89,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_052","Well! We have much to discuss and digest. Let us retire to Saint Coinach's Find for the present and there plan our next step. Lest there be any doubt, our expedition has some way to go yet!"
90,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_060","So good of you to join us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Our meeting would be dull indeed without a full account of your experiences in the labyrinth."
91,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_061","Take a moment to collect yourself, and when you are ready, we shall debate how best to proceed."
