Impressed by your calm demeanor amidst the madness, she encourages you to investigate a scream she heard coming from the direction of the Hyaline."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS801_01210_SEQ_02","You have rushed to the scene of the cry to find a woman trembling in fear. The cultured madam insists that the man before her is none other than the Slasher, and encourages you to apprehend him before he claims any more victims. Express your /doubt as to the man's intentions."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS801_01210_SEQ_03","The madman insists that he has been misunderstood, and that the loss of the “very appendages of his soul” is responsible for his delirious state. Imploring you for aid, he asks you to seek out three influential acquaintances of his─Guildmasters H'naanza of the Armorers' Guild in Limsa Lominsa, Beatin of the Carpenters' Guild in Gridania, and Severian of the Alchemists' Guild in Ul'dah─before the inexplicable ailment he suffers from claims his very life."
4,"TEXT_SUBCTS801_01210_SEQ_04","You have traversed the realm and spoken with the three guildmasters, each of whom entrusted you with a package for Jandelaine. Deliver them to the stricken man in hopes that, whatever the contents might be, they will cure him of his affliction."

Profusely grateful for your kindness in his hour of need, he offers you unlimited access to his services, with no need for reservation.

※Ring the crystal bell in any inn room to summon the aesthetician.
