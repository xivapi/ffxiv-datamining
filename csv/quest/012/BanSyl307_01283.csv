With touched sylphs ever looking to steal away podlings to add to their numbers, Moxia would ask your aid in delivering a ready-to-sprout podling back to the safety of Little Solace. Travel to the Seedbed and take the podling in hand."

She fears, however, that the touched sylphs will not cease their attempt to rob the Seedbed, and asks that you lend your aid again."
