1,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_01","The pseudoscholar Voyce has belatedly come to the conclusion that the sylphs who had captured him are in possession of a podling containing the Chosen One. As he neither understands the full implications of this nor possesses the courage to investigate the matter himself, he bids you speak with Olmxio."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_02","Aghast at hearing that the Chosen One is in the hands of the touched sylphs, Olmxio urges you to go in search of the podling at once, casting a spell of transparency upon you to aid in your quest. Infiltrate the Sylphlands and spy upon any ill-intentioned sylphs you might find, that you might ascertain the location of the Chosen One's podling.

※This task must be completed before Olmxio's enchantment expires. To extend the length of his spell, interact with the fragrant blooms you encounter on your path."
3,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_03","To your fortune, the heedless sylph tasked with transporting the Chosen One's podling has misplaced his charge somewhere near the entrance to the Sylphlands. Hurry and find it before the touched ones do!"
4,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_04","You have secured the podling, which is a great deal weightier than you imagined. Transport it safely back to Little Solace while the strength in your arms remains.

※To bolster your strength while carrying the podling, interact with the patches of moongrass that you find along the way."
5,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_05","The Chosen One's podling now rests safely in Little Solace. Inform Voyce that you were able to succeed in the task without his help."
6,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_06","While relieved that the Chosen One is safe, Elder Frixio does not believe that the touched ones will give up so easily, and warns you that retaliation may come sooner than you think."
