1,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_01","The pseudoscholar Voyce has belatedly come to the conclusion that the sylphs who had captured him are in possession of a podling containing the Chosen One. As he neither understands the full implications of this nor possesses the courage to investigate the matter himself, he bids you speak with Olmxio."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_02","Aghast at hearing that the Chosen One is in the hands of the touched sylphs, Olmxio urges you to go in search of the podling at once, casting a spell of transparency upon you to aid in your quest. Infiltrate the Sylphlands and spy upon any ill-intentioned sylphs you might find, that you might ascertain the location of the Chosen One's podling.

※This task must be completed before Olmxio's enchantment expires. To extend the length of his spell, interact with the fragrant blooms you encounter on your path."
3,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_03","To your fortune, the heedless sylph tasked with transporting the Chosen One's podling has misplaced his charge somewhere near the entrance to the Sylphlands. Hurry and find it before the touched ones do!"
4,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_04","You have secured the podling, which is a great deal weightier than you imagined. Transport it safely back to Little Solace while the strength in your arms remains.

※To bolster your strength while carrying the podling, interact with the patches of moongrass that you find along the way."
5,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_05","The Chosen One's podling now rests safely in Little Solace. Inform Voyce that you were able to succeed in the task without his help."
6,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_06","While relieved that the Chosen One is safe, Elder Frixio does not believe that the touched ones will give up so easily, and warns you that retaliation may come sooner than you think."

49,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_002","Are you perchance familiar with how baby sylphs are born? Perhaps I can put it in layman's terms. You see, sylphs come into this world in the form of a bulb, not unlike certain types of flora."
50,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_003","But these bulbs will not sprout into a sylph of their own volition. No, they must first be incubated within a special pod─forming what is known as a “podling”─and given sufficient warmth and nutrition. Then, and only then, will a newborn sylph emerge."
51,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_004","This got me to thinking... Those frightful sylphs who accosted me said something about a podling, yes? I didn't put it together then, but..."
52,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_005","Yes, surely the Chosen One slumbers as a podling even as we speak...a podling which they assumed I had come to steal! This must be why they acted so threatened by my presence!"
53,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_006","We should continue our search in the Sylphlands straightaway. That is to say, <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> should continue it. I mean, I'd go with you, of course! It's just, uh... <cough> <cough> ...Still feel so weak... <cough> Ahem. I'm sure Olmxio would agree. You should go see what he thinks."
54,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_000_011","Bumbling one said <Emphasis>what</Emphasis>!? Chosen One yet exists as a podling? Why did bumbling one not tell this one sooner!? There is no time to lose!"
55,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_000_012","Walking one must become running one, and retrieve Chosen One's podling from the Sylphlands with all haste!"
56,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_001_012","This one can help. This one uses see-through magic, so that walking one becomes hidden one."
57,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_000_013","But be careful─see-through magic will not last long. If touched ones see walking one, walking one is in trouble. Now hurry, and find Chosen One!"
