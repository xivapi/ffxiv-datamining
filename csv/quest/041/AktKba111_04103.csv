1,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_01","After sifting through a mountain of reports, the Order of the Twin Adder has found a common thread: of late, Gleipnir has been most frequently sighted in the South Shroud. Kan–E–Senna has already departed for Rootslake and bid you meet her there."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_02","Together with the Elder Seedseer you seek out her sister, Raya–O–Senna, who has made her home in the southern marshlands. Their pleasant reunion is undercut by tension, as fear of Gleipnir grips the remote community. Although none of its residents have come to harm, Raya–O believes that it is only a matter of time before the blasphemy strikes. She urges her sister to entreat the elementals for aid, but the Elder Seedseer is reluctant to do so just yet. For now, she decides to speak with the people of Camp Tranquil, that she might assuage their fears and assure them that this crisis will soon pass."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_03","The people of Camp Tranquil are understandably nervous, but Kan–E–Senna's calming presence seems to be having a positive effect.

※You must be accompanied by Kan–E–Senna to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_04","The people yearn to give voice to their concerns, and the Elder Seedseer is more than willing to lend them an ear. The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents, too, recognizes there is much to be gained by visiting others.

※You must be accompanied by Kan–E–Senna to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_05","Speaking with the people of Camp Tranquil has bolstered Kan–E–Senna's resolve, but before you can resume your hunt for Gleipnir, a flustered Wood Wailer arrives and explains that a group of Gridanians has fled their homes to seek refuge in Thanalan. Per the Elder Seedseer's earlier instruction, however, all are to remain within the safety of the camp until the threat has passed. Nevertheless, the people are adamant that they be allowed to cross the border, and the Wood Wailers are but few, and so the Elder Seedseer goes to resolve the situation before it comes to a head."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_06","Kan–E–Senna attempts to calm the people, but to no avail, for one youth grows panicked upon realizing he has been marked by Gleipnir's poison. Before it can claim his life, however, despair takes hold of his heart, and he turns into a beast. The man beside him recoils in shock and, after crying out for his lost companion, undergoes a similar transformation. Both must be slain before they flee and spread terror throughout the Twelveswood."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_07","Though the beasts are soon laid to rest with no further lives lost, the Elder Seedseer remains distraught. Perhaps you can offer her a shoulder to lean on..."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_08","Though Kan–E–Senna is shaken, she maintains her composure as she implores the people to return to their homes. The incident serves as a stark reminder that while Gleipnir is indeed a danger to the realm, despair can be even more deadly, transforming the distraught into beasts. The Elder Seedseer finally accepts that she must seek the aid of the great one, but there are preparations that must be seen to beforehand. The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents at the Adders' Nest, however, may have further instructions for you."
9,"TEXT_AKTKBA111_04103_SEQ_09","It will take some time before Kan–E–Senna is ready to commune with the great one. In the meantime, her attendant asks that you prepare both mentally and physically.

※The next role quest will be available from the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents upon reaching level 87 in any tank class."
