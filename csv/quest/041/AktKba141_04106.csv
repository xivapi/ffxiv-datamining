1,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_01","Mere moments after your arrival, the moogles come bearing only the finest saplings for use in the purification of the Twelveswood. Before you depart, however, Kan–E–Senna joins you at the Adders' Nest, looking as vibrant as ever, and offers to consecrate each sapling with a prayer as Jorin did long, long ago. She senses that the flow of aether has become warped near Greentear, and so it is decided that it will be your first destination."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_02","Having cleansed the corruption, the soil is ready to receive the sapling. Kan–E–Senna awaits your signal to finish the ceremony."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_03","The Elder Seedseer plants the sapling in the purified soil and offers a prayer to the elementals. The ceremony seems to have been successful, but your work is far from finished. Kan–E–Senna senses another taint near the Silent Arbor, and bids you follow."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_04","You cleanse the corruption and fell the corrupted sprite with ease. Kan–E–Senna may now proceed with the ceremony."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_05","With a sapling and a prayer, the Elder Seedseer once again restores a weakened portion of the forest to good health. Although the next source of corruption is distant, Kan–E senses that it is somewhere in the vicinity of Hyrstmill."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_06","The corruption in Hyrstmill is faint, and the ceremony is carried out quickly and without incident. Before you leave, however, you are approached by a man who is surprised to see the Elder Seedseer in his village, and distressed to learn her purpose in coming there. He protests her efforts to placate the elementals at the expense of her people, as he perceives it. As Kan–E–Senna attempts to calm him, she learns that they suffered tragedy in the days preceding Gleipnir's appearance, when the Creeping Death claimed the life of a poor woman─the wife of a man she soon realizes is Ea–Sura–Supin, her childhood friend who was stripped of his Padjal horns and cast out many years ago. The nature of Gleipnir's apparent hostility towards the elementals becomes clear: the blasphemy is driven by the lingering resentment of one who grew to believe he had been twice robbed of purpose by the guardians of the Twelveswood. More resolved than ever to see this crisis resolved, the Elder Seedseer makes for Everschade, where the great one slumbers, to beseech its aid."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_07","Kan–E–Senna delivers an earnest plea to the great one, which takes hold of her body to communicate its reply. While it is grateful for your efforts to cleanse the Twelveswood of corruption, the elementals still fear the blasphemy's poison, and are reticent to lend their strength. The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents protests, and is joined a moment later by a chorus of other voices─people come from all across Gridania to lend their support to their leader. Moved by this display, the great one relents and offers up branches of the Guardian Tree, instructing those present to attach them to the oldest trees in the forest. By doing so will the great one be able to channel its power to every corner of the woods, purging once and for all the corruption from their home. The end of Gridania's great ordeal draws near, and the Elder Seedseer returns to the city to prepare."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_08","Kan–E–Senna's attendant informs you that the people are hard at work bearing the Guardian Tree's many branches to the far reaches of the Twelveswood, in preparation for the final ceremony the Elder Seedseer must perform. The Keeper bids you make ready for an encounter with Gleipnir as well, for the beast will surely attempt to interfere with your plans, and when it does, you must be there to meet it.

※The next role quest will be available from the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents upon reaching level 90 in any tank class."
