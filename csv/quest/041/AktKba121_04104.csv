1,"TEXT_AKTKBA121_04104_SEQ_01","Gleipnir's assaults continue unabated, and it has only become more clear that Gridania's sole hope for salvation lies with Kan–E–Senna's efforts to enlist the aid of the great one. You have only a moment to ponder this situation before the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents receives word via linkshell that Gleipnir has emerged once again─this time near the Guardian Tree. Wood Wailers have engaged the beast, but they are surely overmatched. The Elder Seedseer has instructed you to join her at Sorrel Haven with the utmost haste."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA121_04104_SEQ_02","You arrive at Sorrel Haven to find pieces of discarded armor and weaponry strewn about the ground. As you inspect the site, a vicious growl is the only warning you receive before being ambushed by feral beasts. You make quick work of the threat, but its presence bodes ill for the survival of the missing Wood Wailers. Kan–E–Senna is surely close, and so you must keep watch for more abominations until she arrives."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA121_04104_SEQ_03","The Elder Seedseer concludes that the Wailers, facing Gleipnir and certain death, must have succumbed to despair and turned into beasts like others before them. With grim determination she declares that they must be put to rest. She suggests splitting into two groups to track the monsters. When the hunt is finished, you are to reunite with your companions at Everschade."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA121_04104_SEQ_04","After a brief search you encounter the former Wood Wailers and bring an end to their suffering. With Gleipnir nowhere to be seen, no immediate threats to the Guardian Tree remain, and so you may wait at Everschade for Kan–E–Senna to return."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA121_04104_SEQ_05","Kan–E–Senna attempts to commune with the great one, but is repelled by a wave of pure terror. The heart of the forest is seized by fear and cannot aid you until it is calmed. To your collective horror, Gleipnir then leaps into the clearing, snarling in defiance. As the beast lunges forward, the Elder Seedseer places herself in his way and receives the full brunt of the charge. She is knocked to the ground, and as you brace for battle, the Echo grants you a vision of a young Padjali boy and girl, the latter of which bears a striking resemblance to Kan–E. As the vision fades, you see Gleipnir standing over the unconscious Elder Seedseer...but rather than attack, it slinks back into the woods. While it seems Kan–E was not wounded, her attendant resolves to deliver her to Gridania as quickly as possible. He will carry her, and asks you to meet him at the Adders' Nest upon your return."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA121_04104_SEQ_06","Kan–E–Senna has already regained consciousness, it seems, but is not yet ready to receive guests. The faithful attendant regrets that he could not protect her from Gleipnir, but an encouraging word from you serves to lift his spirits. He vows that together you will find a way to defeat the blasphemy once and for all, and asks that you return to the Adders' Nest when Kan–E–Senna has made a full recovery.

※The next role quest will be available from the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents upon reaching level 88 in any tank class."
