1,"TEXT_AKTKBA351_04119_SEQ_01","While speaking with the secretariat at Maelstrom Command, you are interrupted by an incoming communication from Wheiskaet, who announces that his men have successfully tracked down the blasphemy and driven it into Sastasha Seagrot. With no time to waste, Merlwyb asks all parties to meet at the Drowning Wench to make ready for your final confrontation."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA351_04119_SEQ_02","As you prepare to set sail, Merlwyb comforts the despondent Noll, assuring him that he will not have to bear the burden of ending his mother's life, as she once had to do with her father. The Admiral briefs all present on the plan of attack, and with nothing left to discuss, you set sail for Sastasha."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA351_04119_SEQ_03","You arrive at the Seagrot in time to find Speaker Doww, or what remains of him after he was brutally mauled by his former mother and queen. The battle is joined, and this time you and your companions─aided by Lorens, who enters the fray somewhat late─succeed in defeating the blasphemy. With the beast at her mercy, Merlwyb fires the final bullet and puts it out of its misery once and for all. Two members of the Crushing Tide are present to witness the struggle, and are moved by your deeds and Merlwyb's words to put aside their hatred of the Lominsans and work towards peace. Your mission accomplished, you and your companions breathe a sigh of relief and prepare to sail home."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA351_04119_SEQ_04","Back at the Wench, Lorens─now revealed to be none other than the Company's former commander─is accosted by his men, who are none too pleased with his penchant for vanishing when needed most. Eventually, tempers cool, and it comes time to relinquish your role of acting commander and bid farewell to your men."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA351_04119_SEQ_05","With a few parting words, you formally dismiss each member of the Company of Heroes, thanking them for their service and sending them back whence they came. Lorens alone remains, ready to take his leave..."

Nevertheless, she understands he had his reasons, and is forever grateful to the man she considers a brother in all but blood. Lorens brushes aside her kind words, stressing that she has shouldered a heavy burden for a long time─too long, perhaps...but she is her father's daughter, and Limsa Lominsa yet has need of her leadership. His part in the tale finished for now, Lorens wishes Merlwyb and you well and goes off on his own once more."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA351_04119_SEQ_07","Though the events of the day weigh heavy on his heart, Noll is nevertheless able to take comfort in the knowledge that there is hope for peace between the Sahagin and the Lominsans.

The Sahagin take their leave, and only you and Merlwyb remain."
