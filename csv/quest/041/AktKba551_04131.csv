1,"TEXT_AKTKBA551_04131_SEQ_01","Aymeric arrives at the Congregation with word that his secret weapon is ready. It is revealed to be none other than the Fury's Grace, the holy crozier of the archbishop, which Bishop Vartinoix recovered from Azys Lla. Exploiting the blasphemy's instincts, you will use it to lure the creature to the Chancel when next it appears over Ishgard, and thence strike it down. The strategy thus determined, you see to your preparations before proceeding to the Vault."

As expected, its draconic silhouette is soon spotted, and as expected, it is drawn to the crozier in Aymeric's hand. Upon realizing it has been deceived, it lashes out at you with all its rage, but you nevertheless succeed in striking it down, and lay to rest the souls of the knights of the Heavens' Ward.

6,"TEXT_AKTKBA551_04131_SEQ_06","Last but never least, Aymeric thanks you and Artoirel for the vital roles you played in vanquishing Profane Fafnir. With no other Ishgardians having turned since the council, he prays that Ishgard is finally free of the scourge of despair, and swears that he will work to build a nation united and filled with hope. With surely nothing left unsaid, Artoirel bids you bear word of your success to the Ishgardian delegate in Radz-at-Han, that other nations may benefit and take inspiration from your firsthand account of events."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA551_04131_SEQ_07","Arriving at Sundrop, you deliver the glad tidings to the Ishgardian delegate. The man takes the opportunity to confess his admiration for you, and you make a mental note to share some of your adventures with him one day, should the opportunity arise."
