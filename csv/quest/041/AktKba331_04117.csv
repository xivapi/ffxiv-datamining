1,"TEXT_AKTKBA331_04117_SEQ_01","The Crushing Tide have struck again, and Candlekeep Quay is under attack. You prepare to contact the Company of Heroes and order them into battle, that the threat may be quashed before the residents suffer any casualties."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA331_04117_SEQ_02","You reach out to Wheiskaet and the Company via linkpearl and order them to defend Candlekeep Quay. With Landenel and U'odh Nunh already in the vicinity, you assign each their tasks and send them on their way, while resolving to join them as soon as possible."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA331_04117_SEQ_03","You arrive at Candlekeep Quay to find that the Company of Heroes succeeded in fending off the raiders and seeing the residents to safety. Interrogating two of the captured Crushing Tide after the battle, you learn that Doww is hiding out on a deserted isle that Merlwyb surmises is located in the Cieldalaes. All present resolve to set sail to promptly deal with the threat."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA331_04117_SEQ_04","On the isle you come face-to-face with Doww and the blasphemy, whose presence stirs the power of the Echo. You are granted a vision which reveals that the blasphemy was born of none other than the Indigo Matriarch, queen of the Sahagin, who was overcome with despair for the plight of her people. Regaining your senses, you and your companions confront the beast, only to be incapacitated by a devastating attack that saps your strength. Fortunately, you manage to escape unharmed thanks to a well-timed bullet fired by an unknown sharpshooter. Making for the docks, you regroup with your companions and consider your next course of action."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA331_04117_SEQ_05","The members of the Company vent their frustration at their failure to defeat the blasphemy. Noll, for his part, is deeply distressed by the revelation that the abomination was once his people's mother and queen. Together with Wheiskaet, you ponder the implications of what you have learned from your brief encounter, while Merlwyb declares her intent to dispatch scouts to track the escaped beast, and ascertain where it is taking shelter."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA331_04117_SEQ_06","Back at Maelstrom Command, Merlwyb considers how the beast might be dealt with. Reaffirming her confidence in you and the Company of Heroes, she muses about attempting to recruit the Company's missing commander to aid in your cause. She encourages you to rest up while you can, as your greatest challenge still lies ahead.

※The next role quest will be available from the Maelstrom secretariat upon reaching level 89 in any melee DPS class."
