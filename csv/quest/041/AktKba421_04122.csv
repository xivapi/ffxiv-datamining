1,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_01","Yugiri suspects Kisei hails from her home of Sui-no-Sato, and after asking the Kojin to inquire in her stead, she is all but certain. To learn more would require speaking with the people of Sui-no-Sato in person, a seemingly impossible task due to her exile imposed by the Ruby Princess. To that end, she asks you to lead the investigation while she accompanies you in disguise. She will meet you at Onokoro after donning a suitable guise."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_02","You arrive to find Yugiri dressed in the selfsame garbs she wore when you first met in Eorzea. Before departing, she explains to you the reason for her banishment─that her people feared she might drag them into Doma's war with the Empire. Putting the past aside for now, you press onward and downward, into the deep beneath the waves of the Ruby Sea."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_03","Kisei's banishment was likely decades ago, meaning only the elders among the village would remember what became of her. With that in mind, Yugiri asks you to walk about Sui-no-Sato, speak with her people, and see what you can learn.

6,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_06","Yunagi tells you of Kisei's past, and her gifts that drew the scrutiny of the Ruby Princess. Whether she does possess preternatural powers remains to be seen, but what is certain is her claims led to her exile.
