2,"TEXT_AKTKRA105_04479_SEQ_02","Erichthonios reveals his fraught past with Lahabrea, his father. Although the gaoler learned the art of shackles from said man, there is little else connecting father and son, and when Erichthonios's mother─previous chief warden of Pandæmonium─passed away, Lahabrea assumed her position with characteristic stoicism. Although there is surely more to the story, Erichthonios changes the subject to Hesperos and the battle ahead. After some discussion, you decide that he should be tracked down with the utmost haste and sealed away with interment magicks, that he might be questioned and his motives made clear. Although Hesperos's mastery of creation magicks means that you must face him in an unfavorable battle, hope ever remains in your heart.

4,"TEXT_AKTKRA105_04479_SEQ_04","Your hopes to detain Hesperos for questioning are thwarted when he brings an end to his own life, his essence and secrets returning to the star. While this leaves many questions unanswered, Erichthonios is eager to begin rescuing his colleagues and the subjects he is charged with safekeeping. Themis takes control of Asphodelos, but as he does, he senses a presence from deeper within the facility─and no sooner does he inform you of this discovery than a ward appears to block your way forward. Stymied, Themis suggests withdrawing for now, that he might better gauge this new threat."
5,"TEXT_AKTKRA105_04479_SEQ_05","With room to think, Themis concludes that Hesperos was not the one behind the chaos in Pandæmonium, and suggests that the true mastermind is hiding deeper underground. To progress further, however, you must find a way to surpass the obstruction blocking the entrance to Abyssos, a feat which may take some time. Themis and Erichthonios encourage you to rest until you are needed once more, and perhaps in the meantime return to Aporia to apprise Professor Claudien of your exploits."
