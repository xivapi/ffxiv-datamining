Shaggles is searching for a solution."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_SEQ_01","Shaggles is despondent as he finds himself unable to come up with a suitable plan to rid the Archeion of its woodworm infestation. N'welhi Tia suggests you try petting the young troll to see if you can lift his spirits.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_SEQ_02","You tenderly pet Shaggles, but he doesn't seem especially happy about it. Perhaps he'll appreciate your intentions if you pet him once more."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_SEQ_03","Shaggles starts to feel more like himself after a good petting. With further discussion, he decides that attempting to suffocate the woodworms is the best course of action."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_SEQ_04","Shaggles's plan will require limestone and acid to create a smothering gas, and you helpfully procure the former from the thirty-third facet for him. As the acid was N'welhi Tia's troll-assigned problem, you need only meet him and Shaggles back at the Archeion."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_SEQ_05","The testing phase of the plan goes smashingly well and, as promised, Shaggles is freed from his former specimen status and made an apprentice researcher. Delighted by his success, he resolves to do all he can to find a way to converse with those who do not possess the Echo."

53,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_NWELHITIA_000_003","You know, creatures like trolls tend to perk up when someone pets them. Why don't you show Shaggles some affection?"

71,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_026","But we can't use our strong pesticide. The fumes would grrr havoc..."
72,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_100_026","Wait, fumes... That's it─we need to suffocate the vilekin!"
73,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_027","The woodworms do come from tropical climes, so their weakness would probably be freezing temperatures. Though if we make it too cold in the Archeion we'd risk exposing the books to frost damage when all the moistgrrr in the air freezes..."

76,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_100_029","I suppose the easiest way to “end” any creature is to stop it from breathing... Depriving them of the air they need to survive!"
77,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_030","I bet we could starve the worms of oxygen with the gas emitted when you pour hydrochloric acid on limestone. We'll need to evacuate the staff and other living specimens, but it wouldn't damage the tomes or documents."
78,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_031","We won't know if it'll work unless we grrr it a go. N'welhi Tia can get the acid, so I just need you to find some limestone."

87,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_054","You know, I've been on my own almost as long as I can remember. I do recall that I constantly questioned my parents, which is probably what led to them giving up on me altogether."
88,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_055","That same intelligence─or belligerence, depending on who you grrr─saw me rescued and brought here. It made me interesting, I suppose. But I've only ever been treated as a specimen. You're the first person I've been able to have an actual conversation with."
89,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_056","For the longest time, the Archeion's books were my only friends. They were both my loyal companions and my window from which I gazed upon the outer world."

96,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_063","And allow me to thank <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> for everything. I couldn't have done it alone."
97,"TEXT_AKTKZA104_04483_LITTLETROLL_000_064","My very first project as an apprentice will be to study how to produce sounds just like your kind do. After grrr, if I want to be a researcher, I need to learn how to speak with people other than you."
