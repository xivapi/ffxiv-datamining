Yezahn has yet another favor to ask of the only adventurer he knows."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_01","The troubles facing Palaka's Stand continue to mount, the most pressing of them being the lack of supplies and able bodies. Yezahn asks you if you know anyone who could help, and you mention Kancana and Ogul, who reside in Yedlihmad. Yezahn seems eager to make their acquaintance, and leaves it to you to enlist their aid.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_02","Kancana listens with growling concern as you explain the purpose of your visit. She agrees to help Palaka's Stand without question, and promises to have a shipment of supplies ready posthaste. Ogul offers to protect the shipment, and rushes off to the gates of Yedlihmad with Racashir hot on her heels."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_03","Ogul and Racashir are ready to depart, with the former carrying the supplies on her back. Keep an eye out for hungry monsters and daring bandits as you make the long journey to Palaka's Stand."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_04","You rescue Ogul and Racashir from the maws of a hungry beast. They do not appear to be unharmed, but Racashir is staring at you with an awed expression."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_05","Racashir is impressed with your display, and while Ogul is thankful for your help, she is eager to commence the adventure. She rushes off with a boisterous challenge, leaving the supplies behind. Luckily, Racashir remains to pick up the slack."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_06","You arrive to find a monster slain, with Ogul and Sula standing over it triumphantly. Sula is pleased to see you, and it seems that in Ogul she has found a fierce fighting companion. She offers to escort you to Palaka's Stand, where it seems Yezahn is awaiting your arrival."
7,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_07","Yezahn is grateful for the arrival of supplies and protection both, and Ogul seems to have found her next adventure. She presents Yezahn with a journal she found during the journey, which the alchemist reveals belonged to Mehvan and Qerasaf. This unexpected discovery is welcomed, and it seems that there is hope for Palaka's Stand at last."
8,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_08","Ogul resolves to help the people of Palaka's Stand rebuild, and is eager to resume Racashir's instruction in the fine art of adventuring. The sun shines bright on Palaka's Stand, and the tenseness in Yezahn's shoulders seems to have dissipated entirely."
9,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_SEQ_09","With the pressing crisis facing Palaka's Stand solved, Yezahn basks in the first moments of comfort he has had in some time. The reverie is short-lived, however, as he quickly turns to what must be done in the days ahead. With his help, and the help of the settlement's new arrivals, wounds will heal and the citizens of Palaka's Stand will come to know peace once more."

49,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_YEZAHN_000_003","The recent crisis has caused the flow of supplies to grind to a halt, and the people can scarcely meet their daily needs. This would be the case even without the influx of refugees."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_YEZAHN_100_003","One way we might alleviate this is to requisition a shipment from Yedlihmad, but the process takes precious time. I fear that many would starve before we see a single sack of grain. "
51,"TEXT_AKTKZF201_04497_YEZAHN_000_008","All of this is exacerbated by the lack of able-bodied fighters. The wounded are many, and there are few who have the strength and skill to guard us from the beasts lurking in the forest."
