Kancana looks at you expectantly."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_01","Pleased that you have chosen to take on more work, Kancana offers you a job helping a local fisherman with his monster problem. Ogul all but drags you along with her as she heads off to the western shore to find your next Arkasodara employer.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_02","You meet with the Arkasodara fisherman, who explains that the overland routes have become unsafe due to the rising number of monsters in the area. He asks that you first speak with the nearby locals to gain a fuller understanding of the situation at hand, but it seems Ogul will be unable to accomplish that task without you at her side..."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_03","You indicate your readiness to help Ogul with her inquiries, and her face takes on a look of grim determination.

※You must be accompanied by Ogul to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_04","You question the locals, and learn that aggressive, long-tongued brutes have been terrorizing the roads. Return to the Arkasodara fisherman with your newfound insight.

※You must be accompanied by Ogul to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_05","The fisherman puts a name to the hostile creatures, calling them “pisaca.” It seems they are usually found further inland, but the lack of recent patrols has emboldened them to expand their territory─an invasion which must be met with decisive retribution. An eager Ogul rushes off to begin the hunt, leaving you to follow in her wake."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_06","You find Ogul standing over the corpse of the pisaca she has slain. She asks that you pursue its fleeing packmates to the northwest while she hauls the carcass of her foe back to the fisherman."
7,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_07","You have slain the two remaining pisaca. Return to your employer and inform him of the deed."
8,"TEXT_AKTKZA202_04490_SEQ_08","Upon your return, the fisherman shares his philosophy on the sanctity of life, and explains how they intend to make use of the pisaca's remains. Ogul, for her part, is surprised and pleased by the similarities with her own tribe's customs. Little by little, it seems that she is learning to separate her feelings for the Arkasodara from her fear of their violent Gajasura cousins."
