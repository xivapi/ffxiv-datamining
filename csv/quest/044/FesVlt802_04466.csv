※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT802_04466_SEQ_01","A distraught Kupka Kupp tells you of a young Elezen woman by the name of Aloyse, who has suddenly begged the moogle to rescind a letter she posted only moments ago. According to Kupka, tears were sparkling in her eyes as she fled the scene, and now, left only with a vague understanding of where she has gone, the postmoogle begs you and your friends' assistance in locating her. Astrid and Kupka Kupp are to search Greatloam Growery, while you and Pukty Piko are to head to Nophica's Altar.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT802_04466_SEQ_02","You have found Aloyse, who expresses contrition for worrying Kupka Kupp. She departs with haste to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, telling you she will divulge all there."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT802_04466_SEQ_03","Aloyse explains that Ezolmile, an Ishgardian blue blood, has sought her hand in marriage. Though she is delighted by the prospect of a life so happily situated with her beloved, she confesses to a worry she cannot shake: she is not noble herself. Heart heavy with doubt, she retrieved her letter, which contained her acceptance, before it could be sent off. Pukty Piko, now wiser to all things romantical in nature, insists she not give up so easily, and together with you and the other emissaries she writes her message anew. Kupka Kupp and Pukty Piko set off at once to see to the delivery, leaving Aloyse to wait for her darling's reply with bated breath."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT802_04466_SEQ_04","Anxiety coursing through her─and unwilling to let her future be decided without her present─Aloyse races off toward the Gentry's Ward, where Ezolmile could be poring over the contents of her letter this very moment. Astrid, concerned for the young woman, urges you to follow her."
5,"TEXT_FESVLT802_04466_SEQ_05","Upon arriving at the Gentry's Ward, you find that Ezolmile has not only received Aloyse's letter, but is in the middle of reading it as well. No sooner has he absorbed his beloved's words than he makes to write a reply. Aloyse returns to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre with all haste to ensure that she is present when Kupka Kupp and Pukty Piko rejoin the group with his correspondence. Lisette, left out of your adventure to the Gentry's Ward, must be getting impatient."
6,"TEXT_FESVLT802_04466_SEQ_06","Pukty Piko and Kupka Kupp return shortly after you, and deliver Ezolmile's letter to Aloyse. Her beloved's reply is of the sweetest nature, and he writes to say that nothing can stand between them and marital bliss. To everyone's surprise, Ezolmile makes an appearance and the two lovebirds leave to discuss their future in a more private setting. So touched is Pukty Piko by the sight of the happy couple that her pom transforms into the shape of a heart, and she becomes a full-fledged emissary of ardor and affection. Kupka Kupp, pink with pride, asks for her continued cooperation during these most jovial festivities."
