1,"TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_01","Hoping to cover more ground, Artoirel suggests splitting up to speak with as many Garleans as possible. He asks you and Fourchenault to speak with the people at Victors' Spoils, while he and the Gridanian sentry carry out their inquiries at Liminal Station IV."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_02","Fourchenault suspects the Garleans, having chosen frozen squalor over the comforts of camp, will not be amenable to conversation. Nevertheless, you must press on and speak with anyone willing to talk."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_03","The Garleans have painted a rather grim picture of their lives, making it clear how their countrymen might succumb to despair. You go and speak with Fourchenault to see what he has learned, though you have little hope he has heard anything better."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_04","There are no glad tidings to be had when you confer with Fourchenault. Before you can decide your next plan of action, however, a shrill cry in the distance interrupts your train of thought."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_05","Following the sound of the scream, you happen upon one of the Garlean refugees. He tells you his comrade transformed into grisly horror and wandered off in the direction of the Tower of Babil. Fearing the worst, Fourchenault bids you give chase while he stays behind to account for all those who yet remain."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_06","You find the wayward beast and slay it before anyone comes to harm. Fourchenault will be glad for the news."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_07","Witnesses to the transformation noted that the man affected was listening to a radio which continues to play a strange, cryptic message. As you consider who could be sending this broadcast, you are soon joined by Aymeric, Merlwyb, Artoirel, and the Gridanian sentry. You listen to the radio together once more, and part of its message strikes a chord with the sentry─he recalls it being the mantra of Nerva yae Galvus of the IIIrd Legion. With this newfound information, Fourchenault is now convinced that Nerva is the blasphemy they are searching for.

Before long, the group's attention turns to the more immediate concern of the Garlean refugees. Though reluctant at first, they are soon convinced to discuss forming an interim governing body, as well as the possibility of rebuilding Garlemald or immigrating to Sharlayan. The grand company leaders have much to think about, affording you the opportunity to rest until there is new word of the blasphemy."
