※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANARK002_04546_SEQ_01","Trna is energetic with news of the Hippo Riders' progress, but Maru, one of her associates, voices an uneasy prediction: due to the hippo carts' limited storage capacity, it will be only a matter of time before bigger competition sweeps them out of business. Not to be deterred, Trna starts considering what niche service the Hippo Riders might offer, but arrives at no clear answer. You agree to meet her at the Great Work in the hopes that her clientele may offer more inspiration.

4,"TEXT_BANARK002_04546_SEQ_04","According to the alchemist, it was a gift of ripe fruit that drew the attention of the vajralangula, and Trna was his unexpected savior. Awkwardly accepting his praise, Trna decides to see the alchemist and his luggage safely into the Great Work before rendezvousing with you to pick up the original delivery."
5,"TEXT_BANARK002_04546_SEQ_05","Due to an unfortunate and explosive incident, the package is still being prepared. Trna suggests asking around the Great Work for niche business ideas in the meantime."

7,"TEXT_BANARK002_04546_SEQ_07","While undoubtedly colorful, the alchemists' accounts of their recent affairs fall short of delineating an eligible service plan. Regardless, it is time to check back with your customer and see if the package is ready.

8,"TEXT_BANARK002_04546_SEQ_08","The package, it turns out, is destined for none other than Yezahn─doubtless far too occupied with parenting to procure needed tinctures himself. As you prepare to depart the Great Work, Trna is struck by an idea to assist busy alchemists, but she puts the thought on hold as you set off to Palaka's Stand to reunite with an old acquaintance."
9,"TEXT_BANARK002_04546_SEQ_09","Upon Yezahn's grateful receipt of the package, Trna senses an opportunity to propose a new hippo-based service─food delivery. Yezahn assures her that such a service would be an attractive option to not only those at the Great Work, but Palaka's Stand as well, given the recently interrupted tradition of bringing fresh meals to those working in the jungle. Buoyed by his encouragement, Trna returns to Svarna in high spirits."

To this, Maru enthusiastically suggests installing a kitchen in Svarna, that the meals they deliver might be freshly made. Striking at the fastest way to anyone's heart─the stomach─the Hippo Riders gear up for the delicious deliveries that await!"
