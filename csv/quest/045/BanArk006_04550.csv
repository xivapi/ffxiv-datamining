※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_SEQ_01","Trna tells you that Acala and his crew are settling in well, despite some personal challenges. Indeed, she seems more worried about the impending arrival of Kancana, who is on her way to Svarna for an important conversation. After everything you've been through together, Trna would really appreciate your moral support.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_SEQ_02","Kancana arrives with Ogul for the dreaded conversation, which turns out to be nothing more than a glowing endorsement of Trna's efforts. Not only has she proven herself as a reliable business partner, Kancana says, but she has managed to do what most thought nigh impossible: rebuild a burnt bridge between the Arkasodara and Gajasura peoples. In a show of her unwavering faith, Kancana gifts Trna the deed to Svarna, allowing the Hippo Riders full autonomy over their land and business. The look of stunned disbelief welling in Trna's eyes reminds you of how much she has overcome to get here."
3,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_SEQ_03","As Trna speaks about the Hippo Riders' future, her countenance alight with new and exciting ideas, somewhere you can still make out the lines of that discouraged racer who once bristled at you by the highroad. But in the next moment, the illusion dissipates, leaving only this young entrepreneur filled with energy, inspiration, and hope for Thavnair's bright tomorrow waiting just on the horizon."

49,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_001","Nothin' much to report, if you can believe it. Acala an' his pals still have their challenges, but we're takin' it slow an' gettin' to know each other."
50,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_002","They've certainly got their own, er, style that some folks find surprisin'. But I figure so long as we reach an understandin' somewhere in the middle, we'll keep gettin' along just fine."
51,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_003","Luckily, all of Acala's battle brothers now have it on good authority that “Trna strong!” so they listen to what I've gotta say without a fuss. "
52,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_004","They're a sight to see around supper, too─not even Maru shovels down grub with that much gusto. But they help out with work how they can, so I'm not worried."
53,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_005","...At least, I wish I wasn't. See, I just got word that Kancana's on her way over. Apparently, she's got somethin' important to discuss."
54,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_006","I'm sure it ain't bad, but just thinkin' about it has my knees shakin'. Would you mind terribly if I asked you to sit in? "

56,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_A1_000_001","It would be my pleasure."

60,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_015","Trna! Thank you for making the time to chat. I know you have quite the busy schedule, so I shall get straight to the point. "
61,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_016","About this land─I believe our terms were that I would lease you this space contingent on your profits, correct? "
62,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_017","Oh, there is no need to look so terrified! Everyone on the island knows just how hard you and your associates have been working."
63,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_018","I had a feeling that you would take well to delivery work, but when I heard that you welcomed a group of Gajasura into your midst, well! “Surprised” wouldn't cover the half of it. You have done what no Arkasodara before could, and it is truly remarkable."
64,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_019","After you've accomplished so much for your community, who would I be to come here and demand that you return this land? No, no, you have no need to worry."
65,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_OGUL_000_020","Seeing Gajasura perform honest work before my very eyes─I'd write home about it, but nobody back home would believe me! "
66,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_021","To tell you the truth, sometimes I can't believe it myself. We may come from different places, but me an' Acala an' all our people shared a lot of the same pain. And none of us really knew what to do with it."
67,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_022","But now look at us! Helpin' others like we've been helped ourselves, an' doin' a damn fine job of it! ...Passable, anyway."
68,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_023","And that's thanks to you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, for helpin' out so much. An' Kancana, for believin' in us and lendin' us this space in the first place. An' Ogul, for always bein' here in a pinch."
69,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_024","Maru an' Ghasa...the rest of my associates... They've all been here, with me, through every sort of thing you can imagine. Even Acala's been a big part of our journey."
70,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_025","It's 'cause of everyone that we got this chance to see ourselves as somethin' bigger than just “misfits.” So on behalf of all my Riders, I truly thank you. From the bottom of my heart."
71,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_026","I still have the highest of hopes for you, Trna. You and your associates are no longer just delivering parcels and people, after all. You are delivering hope and inspiration to all those on this island."
72,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_027","Which brings me back to why I have come here today. "
73,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_028","I would like to gift you the deed to this land, Trna."
74,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_029","Consider this my investment in a happy, healthy Thavnair. Continue building your business into something you feel truly represents the Hippo Riders, and I will feel more than repaid."
75,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_KANCANA_000_030","I believe that the people of Svarna will bring us closer to the brilliant future we all hope for. Make us proud, Trna."
76,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_031","...Those words mean more to us than you'll ever know. Thank you."
77,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_032","I promise you, we ain't gonna let you down! The Hippo Riders, we...we're gonna deliver everyone straight to a better tomorrow!"

79,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_035","Now that I've got the future of a whole island loaded into my cart, I think it's about time to toss caution to the wind an' ride like I never rode before!"
80,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_036","I've got so many ideas I wanna try! Like, listen to this─once Thavnairian tourism gets goin' again, we could do hippo cart tours! Take folks to see all the prettiest places."
81,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_037","Heh, I've gotten so used to thinkin' up these sorts of ideas, but if you hadn't said what you did back then, none of us would even be here, you know?"
82,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_038","What, did you forget? You were the very first person who ever said that me an' my hippo carts could be somethin' useful. Might've been a throwaway comment to you, but to me─to us─it meant everythin'."
83,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_039","Who'd have thought a handful of words could change the Hippo Riders from misfittin' racers to an independent business? Must be your own sort of magic, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. But we'll be repayin' your kindness every day goin' forward. You can count on that."
84,"TEXT_BANARK006_04550_TRNA_000_040","Alright! Enough chitchat─we've got goods to deliver! Mouths to feed! Drinks to pour! An' most importantly? Hippo carts to ride!"
