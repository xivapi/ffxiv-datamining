Sokles regards you with pointed interest."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZG101_04507_SEQ_01","Sokles welcomes you to Anagnorisis, and promptly assumes you are a familiar seeking to expand its worldly knowledge. To that end, the overseer suggests you speak with the nearby Charmion, and request a guided tour of the area.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

※You must be accompanied by Charmion to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZG101_04507_SEQ_04","During your tour of Anagnorisis, you have learned that much of the work here consists of patient observation─be that of plants, familiars, or gargantuan creatures. The time has come to return to Overseer Sokles, and end your circuit where it began.

※You must be accompanied by Charmion to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZG101_04507_SEQ_05","Convinced that you are some manner of advanced familiar, both Sokles and Charmion seem intrigued by your impressions of their workplace. They ask that you stay for a while, and continue to share your thoughts and observations..."
