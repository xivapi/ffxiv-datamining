Much to Shirabaht's surprise, Sharlayan has requested aid for the Garleans, and though the Ilsabard contingent has already deployed forces to aid them, Shirabaht asks if you might also lend a hand.

The presence of what they believe to be a blasphemy, however, keeps them from ascending the Tower of Babil and traveling to their destination. As such, nation leaders, both near and far, have elected to combine their forces to root out this threat.

In the meantime, he asks you to investigate reports of Garleans transforming into monsters. To that end, Fourchenault suggests reconvening with Artoirel."

Hoping to learn more of what has caused their countrymen to be overcome by despair, Artoirel has a mind to go and speak with them, and he would be grateful for your company."
