※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANARK001_04545_SEQ_02","Your interviews confirm the recent hippo sightings and provide you with some vague intelligence on a delinquent group of Arkasodara refugees. Seeking a clearer image of the situation, you decide to follow up on your most promising lead, a refugee named Trna, who is also in search of hippos around the Perfumed Rise. "
3,"TEXT_BANARK001_04545_SEQ_03","Trna, you discover, is no ordinary refugee─she is the leader of a crew of hippo cart racers, whose reckless riding has been the very talk of the town you came to investigate. Despite an initially intimidating demeanor, Trna expresses her wish to formally apologize for causing trouble, so you accompany her to Yedlihmad to speak with Kancana."
4,"TEXT_BANARK001_04545_SEQ_04","Trna explains that she and her “associates” hail from Vanaspati. While intimidated by the prospect of attempting to fit in with greater Thavnairian society, Trna nevertheless voices her desire to positively contribute to the community in the wake of the Final Days. At this, you suggest that she and her band of racers make the most of their speedy hippo carts by becoming delivery workers, and in order to introduce Trna to the realities of the job, Kancana tasks you both with delivering a package to the Great Work. "
5,"TEXT_BANARK001_04545_SEQ_05","In an act of hippo-based hospitality, Trna offers you a ride to the Great Work on one of her custom-made carts. There, she experiences the joy of successfully delivering a package firsthand, and is able to ameliorate perceptions of her raucous crew somewhat thanks to your stellar reputation and a convenient misunderstanding."
6,"TEXT_BANARK001_04545_SEQ_06","While Trna is eager to report back to Kancana, the hippo that pulled your cart needs to rest before taking another journey. In light of this, she sends you back to Yedlihmad first on her prized set of wheels, pulled by her very own partner-in-ride, Saurya."
7,"TEXT_BANARK001_04545_SEQ_07","Having arrived safely in Yedlihmad with nary a scratch on Trna's prized cart, Saurya trundles away. Hydaelyn's champion though you may be, you must now bear the indignity of walking the several yalms to where Kancana awaits."
8,"TEXT_BANARK001_04545_SEQ_08","As you are relaying the details to Kancana, Trna arrives. It transpires that delivery work is a challenge that she and her associates would be willing to attempt, although the prospect of building trust still feels daunting. Kancana, ever encouraging of struggling hearts, nominates you as a supporting member of Trna's fledgling organization, and offers to lease Trna's crew the grounds of an old trading post to get started."
