※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW403_03013_SEQ_01","The Adventurers' Guild investigator has recently heard that the preparations for the Continental Circus's haunted manor are now complete. Admittedly, given the failure of the troupe's plans in stoking the fears of the populace, this development is of less concern than before, but if you have a mind to investigate, a certain illusionist can tell you more.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW403_03013_SEQ_02","Though exhausted from having to distribute guises of the werewolf to the public day and night, the illusionist is pleased to confirm that the haunted manor is indeed now open to the public. Should you wish to experience the manor's “amusements” for yourself, you need only seek out one the troupe's harlequin guides."

49,"TEXT_FESHLW403_03013_INVESTIGATOR03011_000_001","This too is but a means to a nefarious end, another method by which the Continental Circus plots to stoke the fears of the populace...but since no one seems to be particularly frightened of the werewolf costumes, maybe there's no need to worry."
50,"TEXT_FESHLW403_03013_INVESTIGATOR03011_000_002","Anyway, if you've a mind to look into the haunted manor, you can go and speak with the illusionist yourself."
