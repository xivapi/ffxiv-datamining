※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_01","The area around the castellum is home to many dangerous creatures. To give travelers somewhere to stay at night, J'olhmyn had proposed converting unused storerooms into lodgings. She suggests speaking with someone who has actually slept in one of the newly prepared rooms to find out if anything needs to be improved.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_02","Although the merchant is grateful to have had somewhere to stay, he did not enjoy a good night's sleep. Bedding from Vira Nilya had been provided, but he did not know what to do with it and slept on the floor instead. When Alpa demonstrates the correct method of using the bedding by curling into a coil, it becomes clear that she has no knowledge whatsoever of the needs of their two-legged guests. While J'olhmyn accepts responsibility for Alpa's lack of preparedness, she admits to being far from an expert on inns herself. She recommends looking around Ala Ghiri for those with experience in the field of accommodation to work as an advisor."
3,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_03","Upon arriving in Ala Ghiri, it soon becomes clear that the residents are busy restoring their village since its liberation from imperial rule. Although no one there has the time to go to Castellum Velodyna and act as advisor, you learn of a man called Gales who once worked as an innkeeper in Goodblade before it was razed. Alpa is carrying out her own inquiries and would be glad to hear this promising information."
4,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_04","Alpa is pleased by the news of there being a candidate for the role of advisor. She and J'olhmyn proceed to Goodblade, where Gales is said to be wandering aimlessly."
5,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_05","Gales has hit upon hard times since the fall of Goodblade. He seems convinced that he is no longer of use to anyone, but Alpa persuades him to aid in her cause. Despite being hesitant at first, he accepts the offer and travels with her to the castellum."
6,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_06","Upon seeing the shoddy state of the castellum's sleeping quarters, Gales unexpectedly flies into a rage. Unperturbed by this sudden outburst, Alpa is filled with renewed enthusiasm and vows to do her utmost to carry out Gales's orders. His first instructions are to gather raw materials for building beds and a chocobo stable, which can be found in the wreckage of a nearby imperial base, according to J'olhmyn. She advises you to ride a marid and use its powerful forelegs to smash the scrap metal into pieces small enough to carry. Luckily, Dakshina the Gatekeepers' resident marid trainer has one ready and waiting."
7,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_07","Climbing atop the marid, you head for what remains of Castellum Corvi. The enormous beast should make short work of crushing the scrap left strewn about the area."
8,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_08","Now that you and the marid have finished your work, the Gatekeepers can carry the raw materials back to Castellum Velodyna. Gales and the others eagerly await your return."
9,"TEXT_BANANA003_03038_SEQ_09","Thanks to Gales's cooperation, the castellum's guest rooms and chocobo stable are finally complete. His tutelage has given Alpa a deeper understanding of the travelers and their needs, while Gales realizes that he still has much to learn about the Ananta. Having overcome numerous hurdles, Alpa moves ever closer to bringing her plans for Velodyna to fruition."
