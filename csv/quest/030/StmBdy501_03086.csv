1,"TEXT_STMBDY501_03086_SEQ_01","While visiting the enclave one day you meet with Kozakura, a senior official of the Shazenkai, who tells you of her organization's purpose: to facilitate the reconstruction and revitalization of the settlement. To aid them in their endeavor, she and Lord Hien would have you journey to Revenant's Toll, refuge for the Domans in Eorzea, and bid them return to their homeland. Of course, this matter must also be discussed with Slafborn of the Adventurers' Guild."

Nevertheless, this is a happy occasion, and Slafborn is eager to do everything in his power to see them on their way. Moreover, he states that he will encourage the Eorzean frontier hands to accompany the Domans to Yanxia, that they might assist their Far Eastern comrades in the reconstruction."
3,"TEXT_STMBDY501_03086_SEQ_03","Hozan and his Doman brethren are overjoyed to hear that they may return to their homeland at last. However, this happiness soon gives way to apprehension, for they dare not leave without properly repaying the kindness of the many Eorzeans to whom they owe so much. Seeing this, Hozan declares that he will ensure that they have sufficient time to put their personal and professional affairs in order. In the meantime, he asks that you assist them with their final preparations by making yourself available should he or any other Domans require a consultation."
4,"TEXT_STMBDY501_03086_SEQ_04","The questions the Domans put to you are many and varied, but you answer them to the best of your ability, and their affairs are resolved accordingly. Progress has been made, to be sure, but there is much and more left to be done..."
