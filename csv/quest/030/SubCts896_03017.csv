49,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_001","My dear, if only you'd spare a thought for style and coordination! I hope your garb holds up during a scuffle, because there's little else going for it!"
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_002","That's it! I've made up my mind. From this day forth, I'll take it upon myself to save you from any more fashion disasters."
51,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_003","Let me see... So much that needs to be addressed─where to even begin? Be a dear and get me a drink. I'm feeling rather parched, and this is a matter best discussed over a glass of something cold."
52,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_004","Just go to the Pissed Peiste and ask Folclind. I'll have some blood orange juice. And tell her to make sure there's no pulp in it. Now, off you go!"
53,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_010","Oh my, was it too much to ask? It's just over there, dear─I'm sure you can manage."
54,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_FOLCLIND_000_020","Oh, Swyrgeim sent you, did she? That woman─I've never known anyone so lazy! Would it kill her to come and get it herself?"
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_FOLCLIND_000_021","Here you are. You shouldn't let her push you around, you know. Give her an ilm and she'll take a malm."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_FOLCLIND_000_030","I tell you, that stuff doesn't come cheap. The owner would have to up my pay before I can afford luxuries like that!"

58,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_041","Oh! Delicious! Nothing better on a hot day! Some say I have expensive tastes, but life's too short to settle for second best. Of course, this extends to my choice of wardrobe, too."
59,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_042","Now that I'm feeling refreshed, shall we get started? Do you know, dear, you'd look a lot less drab if you knew how to apply “glamours”!"
60,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_043","""What's a glamour?“ you ask? Well, they use a glamour prism as a catalyst to project the image of one item onto another. It's just an illusion, mind, but very convincing!"
61,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_044","This means the original object stays essentially the same. It just takes on a new appearance, that's all."
62,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_045","Remember, if you fancy a change, you don't have to stick with the same glamour. Just apply another one on top, or use a glamour dispeller to return the object to normal."
63,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_046","Why sacrifice style for such humdrum trifles as “durability” or “protection from bodily harm”? Limitless possibilities for self-expression are just a couple of glamours away!"
64,"TEXT_SUBCTS896_03017_SWYRGEIM_000_047","Go ahead, give it a try! And do make it quick, dear, for my sake. I'm finding your uninspired attire more and more offensive with each passing moment."
