2,"TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_SEQ_02","You arrive at base camp to find Nero sickly and irritable. Cid duly takes it upon himself to brief you on your third opponent, theorizing that the next battle should be far less complicated than the last. As always, Alpha waits patiently for your signal to proceed.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn."
3,"TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_SEQ_03","Alpha stands ready to enter the Sigmascape with you. Gather your gear and your courage, and smash through the defenses of the Guardian!

※Sigmascape V3.0 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."

5,"TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_SEQ_05","After complimenting you on your talent for avoiding giant lasers, Cid expresses regret that you could not have encountered the wonders recreated in the Sigmascape under happier circumstances. But as the final battle of this test world looms ever closer, there seems little point in entertaining such thoughts..."

Not the best stuff to brew coffee with, it turns out..."

66,"TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_050","The file I found on the Guardian says it was a weapon employed in the defense of an empire's capital city. That should give you some idea of the extent of its capabilities."

75,"TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_100","Congratulations, old friend. Judging by the lack of smoking holes, I'd say you have a natural talent for avoiding laser beams. And this is what passes for a straightforward battle in here..."
76,"TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_101","Phantom trains, possessed pictures, and now this magitek-like machine...
Assuming it was real, the realm the Sigmascape is based on must have been highly advanced in both the arcane and the mechanical arts."
77,"TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_102","'Tis truly a pity we cannot identify the test world's origin. Imagine how much we might have learned from such a civilization had we encountered it under different circumstances."
