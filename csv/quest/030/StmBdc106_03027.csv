0,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_00","Alisaie is pondering how best to make use of your reprieve from the tedium of negotiations."
1,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_01","Alisaie is in the middle of suggesting that you take some time to meet the people of Doma when Yugiri approaches with Asahi in tow. While Lord Hien deliberates over the proposed prisoner exchange, Asahi apparently wishes to take a trip around Yanxia. And who better to accompany him than the fabled Warrior of Light. Though you are sure he will be quite safe in Yugiri's company, it is plain that both would welcome your presence. You duly agree to join them, as does Alisaie, and the four of you set out for the town of Monzen."
2,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_02","Upon arriving in Monzen, Asahi is shocked to see what has become of the once-proud home of the samurai. Taking in the devastation wreaked under his sister's governance, he reaffirms his determination to put an end to the conflict between Doma and the Empire. That he might have a better view of the remnants of Doma Castle, Yugiri then leads him deeper into the ruins."
3,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_03","Doma Castle is no more, and Asahi can but lament the loss of the great keep which once graced Yanxia's skyline. Though Yugiri shares his sentiment, she observes that rebuilding such grand edifices will do little to help the people rebuild their lives. At the mention of Doma's long-suffering citizens, Asahi expresses a desire to visit Namai, recalling that the village is only a short journey away. To this end, Yugiri dutifully heads for the nearby docks to ready a boat to bear you back through the Moon Gates."
4,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_04","After a brief trip down the One River, you moor near the Eastern Ryurin Bridge only to hear a voice cry out in the distance. Asahi runs off towards the source of the commotion without hesitation and you follow in turn. Moments later, you are surprised to find Isse and Azami surrounded by a group of Red Kojin. Thankfully, the thick-shelled sellswords prove no match for you, and beat a hasty retreat. The danger having passed, you turn your attention to Isse and Azami, anxious to find out if either one has come to harm."
5,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_05","Asahi lays the blame for the Kojin's aggression squarely at the feet of the Empire, and Yugiri is quick to point out the absurdity of his position. Rather than take offense, however, he implores her to look past old allegiances that you might all work towards the common goal of peace."
6,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_06","While not under the best of circumstances, Asahi seems glad to have had the opportunity to share his thoughts on how relations between Doma and the Empire might be improved. And, regrettable though the battle was, he admits to having relished the chance to witness your martial prowess firsthand."

...Or will we?"
49,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_YUGIRI_000_001","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. A moment, if you would."
50,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ALISAIE_000_002","Ah, Yugiri. And...Asahi, was it? You have some business with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
51,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_003","Business? No. Pleasure, my lady. I merely wished to exchange a few words with the famed slayer of gods and champion of Eorzea. It is <Emphasis>truly</Emphasis> an honor."
52,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ALISAIE_000_004","Such heartfelt admiration. One could almost forget that you're an envoy of the Empire."
53,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_005","Oh? Is that so strange? We may have stood on opposing sides in the past, but I see no contradiction in lauding the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who would do battle with our common enemy."

55,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_007","Now, if I may continue─as we speak, Lord Hien deliberates over my proposal, and I would take this time to see the land I once called home."
56,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_008","Though Lady Yugiri is certain to be a jovial escort, the excursion would be all the more enjoyable for your company─and safer besides."

61,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ALISAIE_000_010","In that case, I will join you as well. There is naught else to do until Lord Hien has reached his decision, and I can think of no finer way to learn more about the current state of Doma."

63,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_021","It's settled, then. The four of us shall make a brief excursion through Yanxia."
64,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_022","Might we start at the town of Monzen? I would see what has become of Doma Castle."
65,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_YUGIRI_000_023","Very well. If you will follow me."
66,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ALISAIE_000_030","I'll admit, I was hoping for a more leisurely trip around Yanxia. But if it's a choice between this or listening to my brother rambling on, well...here I am."

68,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_040","Nay... Can this truly be Monzen, home to the cream of Doma's samurai? I had heard that Yotsuyu intended to send some few of our automata here, but only by way of warning. It should not have come to this..."
69,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_041","Indeed, her savagery served only to incense the people and spur them to rise up in protest. It was folly to think such methods of governance could ever prove effective."
70,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_042","<sigh> The sooner we can begin to make amends for this senseless destruction the better. Securing supplies and support for the reconstruction effort should not prove difficult─once our nations are formally at peace, of course."
71,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_YUGIRI_000_043","...Yes, of course. If you would have a better view of what remains of the castle, we must proceed through the ruins."

74,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_060","It is a travesty. A <Emphasis>travesty</Emphasis>. I remember the keep being so beautiful. In the light of the setting sun, one would swear it was aflame..."
75,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_YUGIRI_000_061","It is indeed a doleful spectacle. Mayhap we will rebuild it one day...when we have finished helping our people to rebuild their lives."
76,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_000_062","Spoken like a true Popularis. The needs of the people must of course come first."
77,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_ASAHI_100_062","Speaking of whom, would you be opposed to my seeing how they live firsthand? The village of Namai is but a short journey from here, if I'm not mistaken."
78,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_YUGIRI_000_063","By river, yes. If you will follow me, I will ready our boat."

80,"TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_YUGIRI_000_075","It has been some time since I last visited Namai. Yet Isse often visits the enclave with young Azami, so we do not want for news from the village."
