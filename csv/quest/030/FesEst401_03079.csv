※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST401_03079_SEQ_01","Nonotta recruits you to help her with a Hatching–tide conundrum. According to the distressed Lalafell, Jihli has been denied her customary prophetic dream this year and thus the Dreamers have settled for arranging an egg hunt around town. The festival eggs in question, however, appear to have been stolen. Join forces with the Hatching–tide hunter near the Greatloam Growery, and see what can be done to save the celebrations.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."

Jihli happily confesses to the crime, and explains how her deceit was in fact inspired by one of her prophetic dreams. Recreating her vision this year is a door to unexpected encounters, and she would have your assistance in organizing the egg hunt which is to follow..."
