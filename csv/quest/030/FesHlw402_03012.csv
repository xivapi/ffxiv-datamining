※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_01","That you may strike fear into the hearts of the people of Gridania more effectively, the Impresario has furnished you with a guise of the wolf. Before you can begin your campaign of terror, he asks that you present yourself to him in your full wolflike splendor. To wit, you must equip a werewolf head, a werewolf body, a pair of werewolf arms, and a pair of werewolf bottoms, which may be obtained from a werewolf attire coffer.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_02","The Impresario declares you to be a hideous, monstrous abomination, with a true gift for horror. With his blessing, you may now go forth and spread terror together with Soga."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_03","If you wish to do something right, you must give it your very all. So believes Soga, who encourages you to make a feral growl of some sort to maximize your fear potential.

4,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_04","Soga's suggestion works like a charm, and the man is duly frightened by your growl. Emboldened, the Lupin proposes that you make a game of it by attempting to scare three more Gridanians apiece.

5,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_05","Sneaking up behind people and growling in their general direction has proven to be a reliable way of eliciting a terrified response─at least in your experience. But has Soga enjoyed the same success as you?"
6,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_06","It would seem that Soga had more and more difficulty scaring the people of Gridania as time went on, perhaps because they had grown more accustomed to his Lupin features. In any event, the many people with whom you interacted expressed an interest in acquiring werewolf costumes of their own, which should doubtless please the Impresario."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_07","The Impresario is delighted to have received so many Gridanians eager to join in the revels by dressing as wolves like you did. When Soga overhears him speaking of a “Night of Devilry,” however, the Impresario asserts that he was only speaking of the “Light of Equality”─a rather nebulous ideal or some such─and quickly takes his leave, assuring you and Soga that he will provide formal contracts for you both to join the Continental Circus at some point in the near future. Whatever the troupe's true objectives, the people of Gridania and Soga seem to be satisfied. One can only hope that the Adventurers' Guild investigator will be as well."
8,"TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_08","Regardless of the circumstances which led to this particular resolution, the investigator is glad to hear that Soga is no longer interested in joining the Continental Circus, and that the people of Gridania are no longer fearful of wolfmen. While the haunted manor is still of concern, the investigator promises that he and his comrades will keep an eye on it and ensure that no Nights of Devilry come to pass."
