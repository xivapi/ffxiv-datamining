0,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_00","Lord Hien has at last reached a decision."
1,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_01","Lord Hien has agreed to the proposed exchange of prisoners on one condition: that Yotsuyu be granted exemption from the transaction should her memory fail to return by the appointed hour. Though plainly displeased by this stipulation, Asahi eventually consents, but not without making one final request: a moment to speak with his beloved sister in private. Hien duly grants his wish, and Asahi is admitted to Yotsuyu's quarters. Doing your best to ignore Gosetsu's obvious anxiety, you wait without, imagining the worst, but when Asahi finally emerges, he concedes that Yotsuyu's condition is not feigned, and entrusts her to Hien's care. It would seem that all is well."
2,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_02","Having agreed upon the finer details of the exchange, there is naught left to do but bid Asahi and his associates farewell. You dutifully escort them back to their ship along the bank of the One River."
3,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_03","Moments prior to departing, Asahi pulls you aside to offer special thanks. Or so he claims. With his back turned to the others, his smile quickly changes to a scowl, and he issues an ominous threat. Yet even as he begins to speak, you are overcome by a vision of the past, wherein you discover he is in fact a fervent admirer of the late Lord Zenos. Realizing you have witnessed his thoughts only serves to stoke the flames in his eyes, and he castigates you for presuming to oppose his master before stalking away. You watch openmouthed as his airship disappears into the distance, dumbfounded by his sudden show of petulance."
4,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_04","Noting your troubled expression, Hien asks if something is amiss, and you distractedly recount your exchange with Asahi. The tale leaves Yugiri and Alisaie understandably aghast, but Hien appears unmoved. Though he concedes the incident does not bode well for the coming prisoner exchange, he remains determined to see it through. After assuring you that he will send word when all of the necessary preparations have been made, he bids you rest, and so you depart for Kugane together with Alphinaud and Alisaie."
5,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_05","Despite your best efforts, the questions raised by Yotsuyu's return have yet to be satisfactorily answered, and the appearance of her stepbrother only adds to the uncertainty. Yet the light of hope cannot be suffered to dim. Regardless of Asahi's aims, you and yours must be ready, that Doma might never again fall under the shadow of imperial rule."

67,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_HIEN_000_057","Of course. You may rest assured your soldiers will be well cared for until your return. We will also begin taking steps to better counter the threat of the Kojin and their eikon."
68,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_HIEN_000_058","Before you take your leave─there is one other matter...
I am informed it was you who took the lead in rescuing two young Domans from a band of Kojin sellswords. I have not yet had the time to thank you properly."
69,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_ASAHI_000_059","Please, there is no need to thank me. I only did what anyone would do under the circumstances. Fortunately, I was in good company at the time."

But you need not concern yourself with the details."

93,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_ALPHINAUD_000_154","I had thought we might use this time to return to Eorzea, but given the volatility of the situation, mayhap it would be best if we remained in Kugane."
94,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_ALISAIE_000_156","Agreed. Between Yotsuyu's amnesia and Asahi's dubious agenda, I'd say we have ample reason to remain in the neighborhood.
If anything should happen─anything at all─you must send for us at once."
95,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_HIEN_000_157","Oh, I will. On that you have my word. Charting a path through this sea of troubles promises to be difficult enough. I am not so proud as to attempt the feat alone."

98,"TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_YUGIRI_000_163","Soon we shall see if Asahi is true to his word. If not, I will be glad to cut out that silver tongue of his."
