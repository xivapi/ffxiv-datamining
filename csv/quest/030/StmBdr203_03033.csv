0,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_00","Cid wishes to discuss your next opponent."
1,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_01","After Cid describes the nature of your next opponent, Nero presents you with a new invention designed to aid in its defeat─the Chocobo Brush. Though he leaves you none the wiser about how it actually works, you gather that the brush will allow you to directly influence the world in which you find yourself. Speak with the waiting Alpha to begin the next stage of Omega's experiment.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn."
2,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_02","Alpha stands ready to enter the Sigmascape with you. Keep a tight grip on the Chocobo Brush, and prepare to battle the haunting Chadarnook!

※Sigmascape V2.0 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."

4,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_04","You recount your victory to your waiting companions, and Nero appears particularly pleased with the efficacy of his invention. He is in the midst of warning you about the brush's decidedly limited range of alternative applications when Cid receives a linkpearl communication from Jessie. It seems that Biggs and Wedge have slipped away from their sickbeds, intent on returning to the Yawn..."
5,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_05","Outside the rift once more, you meet with an anxious Biggs and Wedge. Cid reassures them that, despite some minor difficulties, you have managed to overcome each of Omega's challenges thus far. The two engineers duly pledge their unswerving support, and you cannot help but feel buoyed by their infectious enthusiasm."

I won't confuse you by trying to explain how it works, but suffice it to say that I have adapted the tool to combat the peculiar nature of your rival. Put simply: you will be able to directly influence the space around you by painting pictures."

66,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_NERO_000_045","There was really no need to make it resemble a brush. But as we had a ready supply of chocobo feathers, I thought: why not? Now, let's see what it's capable of, shall we?"

89,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_BIGGS_000_112","Er...the chirurgeon will probably want to have words with us later. But we couldn't just lie back and let you brave the rift on your own."

99,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_BIGGS_000_122","Oh, before I forget, we brought you something to put a spring in your step. You can't fight Omega's creations on field rations alone!"
100,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_NERO_000_0130","Now, what have we─ Hmmm. This next one seems strong, but exhibits no other notable traits. How dull."
101,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_NERO_000_0131","The true challenge is this fourth opponent. But if I can find the patterns hidden in the chaos, then knowledge and reason will prevail."

Tastes like saltwater! Why would─?"
104,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_NERO_000_134","I need to take a closer look at that card."
