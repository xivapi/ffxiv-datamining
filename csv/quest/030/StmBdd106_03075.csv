1,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_01","Alisaie declares the Scions' work in Doma done, and turns her gaze towards Rhalgr's Reach. Lyse will want to hear of Zenos's rumored resurrection..."
2,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_02","Lyse reacts to the news of Zenos's return with predictable disbelief, but Thancred is on hand to propose a simple─if somewhat unsavory─way of settling the matter. Journey to Bloodhowe in the Lochs, and inspect the crown prince's mortal remains."
3,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_03","You heave aside the weighty stone lid atop Zenos's resting place, but contrary to Thancred's predictions, find no writhing snakes or scuttling spiders waiting for you within. The coffin is empty. Leaving Thancred to track down the workers responsible for interring the late viceroy, you prepare to return to the Rising Stones with Alisaie. The other Scions must hear of this development, and the possibility that an Ascian now holds court in Garlemald."
4,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_04","You arrive to find that Alisaie has already made a full report to Urianger via linkpearl. Soon after, you are joined by Y'shtola, who listens carefully to the facts before agreeing that Ascian possession is indeed the most likely explanation. It would seem that Alphinaud has entered into a deadly web of intrigue, and Alisaie cannot help but worry for her brother's safety..."

79,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_THANCRED_000_051","Not necessarily. We might still be dealing with a doppelganger of some kind. An agent could have been sent to dispose of the body in a bid to lend credence to the tale of Zenos's resurrection."
80,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_THANCRED_100_051","More and more, however, I find myself siding with Alphinaud's theory of Ascian possession. Speaking from experience, I can tell you they have no qualms about taking a living host, let alone a dead one..."

82,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_THANCRED_100_052","It seems a distinct possibility. Once I have put this grave back the way we found it, I shall pay a visit to the people responsible for interring the crown prince."
83,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_THANCRED_000_053","Before leaping to any conclusions, I want to know for sure if a body was ever buried here...and how certain we are that Zenos was properly dead."
84,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_LYSE_100_053","If he wasn't, that was some trick. He as good as cut his own head off. Anyway, Raubahn needs to hear about this. If you find anything out, send word to me at Rhalgr's Reach."
85,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_ALISAIE_000_054","<sigh> I don't know why I'm surprised─with matters settling down in Doma, we were due another crisis."
86,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_ALISAIE_000_055","Shall we make for the Rising Stones, then? It's past time we shared these developments with the others."
87,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_LYSE_100_056","I've spoken with Raubahn, and we've decided to keep quiet about Zenos until we have undeniable proof. There's no sense in upsetting everyone if there's a chance we're wrong."

You were headed back to the Rising Stones, were you not?"

92,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_YSHTOLA_100_062","...Disturbing developments indeed. Given all that we know, I too would conclude that an Ascian now inhabits Zenos's body.
