※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS301_03009_SEQ_01","The land is filled with the merriment of the Starlight Celebration once again. Owing to a recent theft of decorations, however, the festival now suffers from a lack of staff, as many have been tasked with tracking down the perpetrators. Amh Garanjy bids you consult with Baenfaeld in Bentbranch Meadows if you wish to be of assistance.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

He and a trio of crimson-clad bears have been preparing a special treat for the festival, sure to bring a smile to one and all. Once you have chosen one of the three bears to act as your mount, the next part of the plan can be put into action."
