1,"TEXT_MANFST005_00445_SEQ_01","At the Bannock, you learn that Ixali activity has been steadily increasing since the appearance of an as-yet-unknown individual in the Twelveswood. Suspecting a connection, Galfrid bids you investigate Lifemend Stump to the northeast."

4,"TEXT_MANFST005_00445_SEQ_04","You have removed the sword from Lifemend Stump. Take it back to the Bannock and show it to Galfrid."
5,"TEXT_MANFST005_00445_SEQ_05","It turns out that the Hyuran lass and Lalafellin lad you encountered are friends of Gridania. Named Yda and Papalymo, respectively, the pair are scholars who are assisting the Gods' Quiver and the Wood Wailers. That revelation aside, your efforts have helped shed some light on the Ixal's recent activities. Galfrid expresses his gratitude, and asks that you continue to labor in service of Gridania and her citizens."
