1,"TEXT_MANFST009_00449_SEQ_01","According to Miounne, all you are required to do during the ceremony is maintain an air of dignified serenity. With the proceedings due to begin at any moment, it's time to don your Monoa mask, and make your way to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre. Estaine, the venue's hardworking caretaker, will escort you to your place."
2,"TEXT_MANFST009_00449_SEQ_02","At the ceremony, Kan–E–Senna tells you of the Warriors of Light─the adventurers who fought for the survival of Eorzea five years ago. The tale of these brave souls triggers inside your mind a vision of their final stand at the Battle of Carteneau. When you subsequently come to your senses, you are surprised to find yourself in a room at the Carline Canopy, with no idea how you got there. Near at hand, Miounne explains that you fainted, and tells you to visit the worried Elder Seedseer. Make your way to Nophica's Altar, and request admission to the Lotus Stand."
3,"TEXT_MANFST009_00449_SEQ_03","It appears that Kan–E–Senna means to ask a favor of you, and no simple one at that. Speak to her again when you are ready to hear her request."
