1,"TEXT_GAIUSE610_00422_SEQ_01","Though Tataru has been forced to abandon her pursuit of a new profession, she would not see her brief sabbatical end without accomplishing something of note. Accordingly, she asks that you accompany her to Costa del Sol─though for what purpose she does not say."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE610_00422_SEQ_02","Once more, you find Tataru dressed appropriately for the occasion─her goal this time being the procurement of pearls from clams native to Bloodshore.

With the benefit of hindsight, she suspects that the receptionist would have managed on her own...but is grateful that you indulged her request even so."
