1,"TEXT_CLSACN150_00458_SEQ_01","Now that all the members of the Mealvaan's Gate inspection party are assembled and briefed, Foreseer K'lyhia is ready to depart. Meet the assessor and the mercenaries outside of Aleport, and prepare to board the merchant vessel <Emphasis>Morningstar</Emphasis>."
2,"TEXT_CLSACN150_00458_SEQ_02","In order to make your way to the <Emphasis>Morningstar</Emphasis>, you must first board the small transport craft tied up at the end of the pier. Speak with the landing boat steersman, and announce the arrival of the inspection party."
3,"TEXT_CLSACN150_00458_SEQ_03","You have defeated the thugs sent to impede the inspection. Speak with the steersman once more."
4,"TEXT_CLSACN150_00458_SEQ_04","You have secured the pier for your companions. Head to the landing boat, and await the arrival of Foreseer K'lyhia and the two mercenaries."
5,"TEXT_CLSACN150_00458_SEQ_05","After a mighty battle with the crew of the <Emphasis>Morningstar</Emphasis>, you manage to arrive before the hatch that leads belowdecks. But just as K'lyhia seeks to begin her inspection, she is suddenly confronted by the ship's dreadful captain. With her grimoire tossed overboard, and her wits scattered by the terrible man standing before her, the foreseer slips into unconsciousness. You have no choice but to abandon the task. Return to the Arcanists' Guild and inform Thubyrgeim of your failure. "
6,"TEXT_CLSACN150_00458_SEQ_06","You learn from Thubyrgeim that the captain of the <Emphasis>Morningstar</Emphasis> is an exiled pirate by the name of Doesmaga, and that this is not the first time the foreseer has suffered at his hands. Though K'lyhia has sustained no lasting physical injuries, her mind may require some time to recover from the shock of the encounter. The acting guildmaster bids you channel your emotions into your training, and clear your head for forthcoming duties.

※The next arcanist quest will be available from Thubyrgeim upon reaching level 20."

54,"TEXT_CLSACN150_00458_KLYHIA_000_006","Now, once we do manage to clear the rails, we will face a deck crowded with armed sailors. For a small party such as ours, the most effective strategy will be to incapacitate individual foes as swiftly as possible─each opponent we down is one less weapon raised against us. It is imperative that we do not allow ourselves to become tangled in multiple, drawn-out skirmishes lest we be overwhelmed. I call this “Stratagem Hammerfall.”"
