1,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_SEQ_01","Much has the wandering minstrel heard of your legendary deeds, but he is more interested in your knowledge of legendary steeds. Upon discovering that you have a full stable of magicked mounts at your beck and call, a revelation dawns on him: could you be the one of whom the ancient hermit spoke, all those years ago? The one who can sound the mystic whistle he has carried with him ever since, and call forth the beast of legend? Convinced that this hero is you, he bids you take the pipe to a suitable stage─the crystal cliffs of Rathefrost─and blow with all your might."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_SEQ_02","You climb the glowing pathway to the Rathefrost cliffs, and blow the magicked dizi beneath the crystal branches. As its piercing note echoes in the air, a mythical Kirin appears before your very eyes. The minstrel emerges from his hiding place, full awed by the sight of the legendary beast, and declares that his word was true: you are indeed the hero to whom the Kirin has pledged its fealty. Whensoever you call upon it with a blast from the whistle, the immortal beast will return to you from its otherworldly kingdom, and whisk you wheresoever you please. And so a new chapter in your epic saga begins..."

Little have I had to wander in search of inspiration these past moons, for the very air resounds with word of your valorous deeds. Are the rumors true?

50,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_002","I knew it! But tell me: in your forays among the beast tribes, did you ever come across a <Emphasis>nightmare</Emphasis>?

54,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_006","I wish for you to have this whistle. I collected it during my wanderings in the East─a gift from an ancient hermit who lived a life of seclusion atop a holy mountain. At the time, I thought it a poor reward for climbing to the top of that godsforsaken peak."
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_007","But as I turned to go, the hermit spake unto me thus: “The gift I give you is no mundane instrument. Only a matchless hero may sound its clarion call, and summon the ageless one... A legend to call a legend forth!”"
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_008","Colt that I was, I thought him senile─a broken man with a broken whistle.

What an honor it shall be to bear witness to the first encounter between the greatest hero of our time, and a mythical creature the like of which the world has never seen! What a song I shall make of it!"
59,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_011","But a sublime song calls for a sublime setting...and I can think of none better than the crystal cliffs of Rathefrost, overlooking Silvertear Lake.

60,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_012","I shall follow you to Rathefrost, and keep out of sight until such time as you blow the fife, and summon the─ Oh, but my heart races just to think of it!

61,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_020","The shining cliffs of Rathefrost are the perfect stage for such an historical moment!

64,"TEXT_SUBCTS822_00432_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_032","That the Kirin has responded to your summons can mean only one thing: it assents to your command. It is as I always knew it would be, from the very moment we met... You are the one the hermit spoke of─the legend fit to call the legend forth!"

To bend its knee to a hero brave, and for its strength to lend.♪"

People the realm over may shout your praises, but who among them can set them to verse as well as I?"
