1,"TEXT_JOBMCH650_02907_SEQ_01","Hilda shares with you the fruits of her Hemlock investigation: a burnt scrap of paper detailing the sale of Hrunting to a prospective buyer. It seems the merchant in question is well known in Limsa Lominsa, and was recently marked by border guards as he entered Coerthas. Join the Hounds as they track the suspected black marketeer towards Boulder Downs."
2,"TEXT_JOBMCH650_02907_SEQ_02","You rendezvous with Hilda, and she reports that the suspicious merchant has been found. Not wishing to act prematurely, she sends a couple of Hounds to confirm that the deal does indeed concern the stolen blade. Follow after Symme as Rostnsthal suggests, and provide any required support."
3,"TEXT_JOBMCH650_02907_SEQ_03","You catch up to Symme, and listen in as the merchant and the bandit discuss the details of their arrangement. Now sure of the target, Hilda orders the Hounds in to apprehend the criminals. During the ensuing battle the brigand leader escapes, but you nevertheless succeed in reclaiming the sacred blade Hrunting. Withdraw to the Coerthas central highlands and await word from Symme and Eudestand on the fugitive leader."
4,"TEXT_JOBMCH650_02907_SEQ_04","Eudestand reports that the bandit leader escaped on chocobo-back, but with the sword now in the Hounds' possession, Hilda deems the operation a success. As the watch begins the trek back to Ishgard, however, Rostnsthal bids you remain behind..."
5,"TEXT_JOBMCH650_02907_SEQ_05","Rostnsthal hints that he may have an inkling as to the origin of the bandit leader's weapon. Lacking definitive proof, however, the former commodore intends to take a leave of absence while he chases down his hunch. Return to the Brume, and inform Hilda of Rostnsthal's plans."
6,"TEXT_JOBMCH650_02907_SEQ_06","Hilda accepts the news of Rostnsthal's absence with surprising equanimity, admitting that she, too, remains curious as to the firearm's origin. Rather than press you into service while Rostnsthal is gone, however, Hilda merely requests that you come back to the Brume in time to hear the end to the tale.

※The next machinist quest will be available from Hilda upon reaching level 68."

52,"TEXT_JOBMCH650_02907_HILDA_000_003","Well, it turns out that this infamous merchant was stopped at a checkpoint on the border. The Temple Knights there were keepin' an eye out for the stolen sword, and reported that the trader was last seen makin' for Boulder Downs."
