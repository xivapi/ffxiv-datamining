61,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_051","You are right─there is a rumor abound at the faire this year. The whispers say that Gegeruju has hidden a treasure somewhere on the isle, and whoever finds it during the festivities can lay claim to it."
62,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_052","Just another shady rumor, much like that of Mistbeard's hidden treasure. It'd be foolish to go to Gegeruju himself with all this, but the trouble is, more than a few folk have taken the rumor to heart."
63,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_053","If any ill comes of all this, it'll be a hassle to Gegeruju and a hindrance to the faire. And so I've taken to looking into things for myself."
64,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_054","I've learned of certain places on the isle that Gegeruju has visited alone on more than a few occasions. Suspicious behavior, indeed, no?"
65,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_055","I mean to visit a number of these myself and expose whatever truth there is behind this mess. And I'd like to ask you to help."

67,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_057","There are several places Gegeruju visits, alone and often. Travel to the one on the north island and discover whatever you can. I will survey the others."

72,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_081","Peeping? Aye, I found the places I visited to be ideal vantage points, as well. And this spyglass would seem to be the nail in Gegeruju's voyeuristic coffin."
73,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_082","Still, damning as it may be, we'll have to catch him in the act. He is visiting the north island as we speak. Come, search for him with me."

77,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_091","Gegeruju, I don't think there's any need to ask, but we will anyway. What in the hells are you up to?"
78,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_GEGERUJU_000_092","Ahahaha! That much is obvious, is it not? I am keeping a watchful eye on those beautiful ladies over yonder. Are they not an absolute <Emphasis>treasure</Emphasis>?"
79,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_093","A watchful eye? It looks to be no more than a peeping eye from where we stand."

81,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_095","Don't tell me you're caught up in all this business, as well."
82,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_GEGERUJU_000_096","It is one thing to attend the festivities and applaud the Miqo'te's lovely dances. It is another thing altogether to keep vigil over their beauty from afar. I certainly am glad I chose to leave things to you this year, Jiriri."
83,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_JIRIRI_000_097","Your praise means much. I daresay the faire would never have grown so lively had we not spread the rumors of a hidden treasure."
84,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_JIRIRI_000_098","Come, Gegeruju. There are other places from which we must enjoy the view. It will not serve to linger too long in any one place, lest we be discovered. Therein lies all the fun, does it not?"
85,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_GEGERUJU_000_099","Right you are! Let us away, then. There are countless other scantily clad Miqo'te being deprived of my watchful eye!"
86,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_100","Well, things have gotten...interesting. Let us return and consider how best to deal with all this."
87,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_110","So, it would seem the rumors of treasure were started by Jiriri in an attempt to fulfill Gegeruju's...desires. To think, this whole thing was a farce spun up by their perverse little minds."
88,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_111","Very well, this is how it will be. If any trouble is born of this treasure nonsense, those two will answer for it. "
89,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_112","As for the faire, so long as the Bombards stay away, we've no need of adventurers' might. But we do have need of your aid."
