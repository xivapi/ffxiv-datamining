51,"TEXT_STMBDA128_02955_ANGRYCOEURL_000_004","Very well. I'll take you up on your offer, stranger...
My little brother's working the rocks by Grymm & Enid. He's got something for me. Can you go and get it?"
52,"TEXT_STMBDA128_02955_ANGRYCOEURL_000_005","Right, then. Frightened Coeurl is his name. Ask him for the leftovers─he ought to understand."

61,"TEXT_STMBDA128_02955_ANGRYCOEURL_000_044","It's a living, and a way of fighting back besides. Our way of spitting in the Garleans' eye for putting our father in an imperial uniform and shipping him off to some faraway province fifteen years ago."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA128_02955_ANGRYCOEURL_000_045","Dunno if he's dead or alive, even. Though, if he were alive, he'd not be long for this world if we were caught fighting for the Resistance. So this is the best we can do."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA128_02955_ANGRYCOEURL_000_046","...That's the long and the short of it. We do what we can, though we know it's not enough."
