49,"TEXT_BANKJN501_02991_ZUKIN_000_001","However, the females often reject attempts to impress them. The males become despondent as a result, so the ray handlers must encourage them to keep trying until they find a mate."

59,"TEXT_BANKJN501_02991_ZUKIN_000_022","It would appear that the ray responded well to your instruction. The handler tells me that if he perseveres, he will find a mate sooner or later."
60,"TEXT_BANKJN501_02991_ZUKIN_000_023","Striped rays are essential to our way of life, but pairing the males and females can be a little troublesome. In most cases, the males must attempt the mating ritual over and over before they succeed."
