49,"TEXT_BANKJN402_02986_ZUKIN_000_001","However, the Namazu struggle to acquire said meat by themselves. Shrewd in business they may be, but adept hunters they are not. Might I call upon your services once more?"

51,"TEXT_BANKJN402_02986_ZUKIN_000_021","Kami have mercy! If size and stench are the measures by which Namazu judge their meat, I would say they will be more than satisfied."
52,"TEXT_BANKJN402_02986_ZUKIN_000_022","Man and Kojin alike tend to be repulsed by such pungent, sinewy fodder, but the Namazu have no such aversions."
53,"TEXT_BANKJN402_02986_ZUKIN_000_023","Trade in this otherwise worthless meat will help forge stronger ties with the Namazu and provide much-needed capital. Perhaps we can rely on your gyuki-slaying skills in the future?"
