0,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SEQ_00","Kabuto is making ready to storm the Isle of Zekki.
※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SEQ_01","Kabuto has every intention of rescuing Tsukumo, but he cannot do it alone. First, he must enlist the aid of his fellow Kojin. As he musters the courage to do so, he asks you to accompany him in case he should falter.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SEQ_02","One of Kabuto's brothers agrees to help much to his surprise. Though only a small success, it gives him courage. So much so, he asks you to wait with Bunchin while he takes on the monumental task of speaking with all the Kojin of Tamamizu."
3,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SEQ_03","Kabuto has done his due diligence and spoken with all his brothers. All that remains is to wait. Then wait. Then wait a while longer. Just as he was beginning to lose hope, the other members of the Divine Circle arrive. They each have taken steps to prepare for the upcoming battle, and their remaining brothers are all at the ready outside of Tamamizu. It is time for battle, and so Kabuto bids you follow him to the Dive."
4,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SEQ_04","The plan to distract the Red Kojin about the island was a success. The entrance is unguarded, and Kabuto is prepared to rush inside."
5,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SEQ_05","Together you and Kabuto fight your way through to the Air of the Opulent and at last find Tsukumo held captive by Hirumaki. A duel ensues, and the ringing of steel against steel is deafening. Alas, Kabuto appears to be no match for Hirumaki. The red-shelled swordsman prepares to deliver the finishing blow when Tsukumo struggles to speak. He offers a few words of encouragement before growing still, and Kabuto realizes at once what has happened. He then finds the strength to strike one last time. Hirumaki collapses to the ground, but Kabuto follows shortly after. With the general defeated, the other Blue Kojin carry the unmoving Tsukumo and Kabuto back to Tamamizu."
6,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SEQ_06","Tsukumo is no more. The doll sits silently on an altar in the treasure vault when Shihoumi arrives to examine it. Kabuto's hopes of saving Tsukumo are dashed, however, when she tells him there is nothing she can do. Feeling defeated, Kabuto casts a sullen look at the altar and notices a peculiar gem on the ground. Shihoumi is quick to identify it as materia, and wastes no time affixing it to Kabuto's helmet. Taking the materia as a parting gift, he vows to honor Tsukumo's memory by redoubling his efforts to serve the Divine Circle."

49,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_002","Yet I cannot stop thinking about Tsukumo's capture. Why strike in Kugane rather than here in Tamamizu? There is little we could have done to stop them had they tried."
50,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_003","Unless... What if this was not the work of the Red as a whole, but a plot by Hirumaki to satisfy his own greed?"

52,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_005","The problem, however, is he is always so heavily guarded."

67,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_VOLUNTEER02977_000_021","Are you well, Kabuto? It's rather unlike you to call on anyone for help. I suppose next Makura will tell us the striped rays are drowning."
68,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_022","Tsukumo has been taken by the Red, and I mean to rescue him."
69,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_VOLUNTEER02977_000_023","So it is true! I had hoped it was only a rumor. But what are we to do? We are not fighters, Kabuto. You would be leading turtles to slaughter."
70,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_024","I realize that, which is why I will not ask you to fight. But I do have a plan that requires your help."
71,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_025","You are perhaps the greatest swimmer the Ruby Sea has ever known, and your knowledge of its currents is unmatched. That is why I would ask you to lead their soldiers on a chase─distract them that I might do battle with their leader alone."
72,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_VOLUNTEER02977_000_026","A chase, you say? Hmmm. It should be simple enough to drag those sea slugs through the waves. It might even prove fun."

75,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_029","But I cannot ask you to be present for everyone. Wait with the elder while I speak with the others."
76,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_BUNCHIN_000_029","Kabuto has taken to recruiting our brothers for his attack on the Isle of Zekki? It seems he has learned much from his time away from Tamamizu."

78,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_BUNCHIN_000_031","I take it you have spoken with everyone, then. Fear not. Your cause is just, and from what <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> has told me, your plan is sound."

81,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_BUNCHIN_000_034","You are too quick to judge your brothers, Kabuto. Take another look."
82,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_MAKURA_000_035","Sorry to keep you waiting. I thought it prudent we have proper weapons should we be forced to confront the Red, so I made a short trip to visit the Qestir."

84,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_SHIKITAHE_000_037","I paid a visit to the forge in Kugane, and the young smith─Shihoumi, I believe is her name─insisted she be brought here to prepare for Tsukumo's return. She seemed quite adamant about seeing to his repairs. "
85,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_038","Shihoumi! I had nearly forgotten. I know not how to repay you."
86,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_ZUKIN_000_039","When a brother is in need, we help. It's as simple as that."
87,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_MAKURA_000_040","Just so. In fact, you'll find more of our brothers are waiting for you outside. Everyone is prepared to do their part to see Tsukumo returned safely."
88,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_ZUKIN_000_041","Which is why I scouted ahead, lest we have any unwanted surprises. I overheard the soldiers on watch speaking of Hirumaki."
89,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_ZUKIN_000_042","They say he's been gloating over his latest plunder, keeping it on display at the Air of the Opulent. It has to be Tsukumo."
90,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_043","Then I know where I must go."
91,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_000_044","As I mentioned before, your task will be to circle about the island and draw the attention of as many soldiers as you can."
92,"TEXT_BANKJN005_02977_KABUTO_100_044","While they're distracted, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and I will sneak onto the island through the Dive. "
