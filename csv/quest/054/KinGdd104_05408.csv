49,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_001","...We should speak elsewhere. Somewhere quiet."
50,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_002","Tell me. You were investigating a ruined church of the First Light?"
51,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_003","You possess a singular talent for dredging up memories I'd sooner forget."
52,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_004","...Not that I can fault you for it. Remembrance is the burden of the living."
53,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_005","What you described sounds like a voidsent I once defeated in the Thirteenth. Back before...any of this."
54,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_006","At the time, I was just another memoriate, traveling the land and hunting the monsters that preyed upon the innocent."
55,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_007","...Until I realized one such monster could be of use to me."
56,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_008","When I sealed it in memoria, I had no other thought but preventing its resuscitation."
57,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_009","But when I agreed to journey to the First as the Ascians' hidden emissary, I remembered that voidsent. "
58,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_010","A creature of its caliber could turn the tide of battle. It could lend me the strength I needed to prevail. "
59,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_011","Drawing its power from the memoria would have been a simple matter."
60,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_012","Yet after bringing it here, I left it to gather dust upon my desk in Lakeland."
61,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_013","If I truly had wanted to defeat Ardbert, that voidsent would have been my solution..."
62,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_014","But I was afraid. Afraid of being twisted by Darkness like so many memoriates before me. Afraid of becoming what I hated the most."
63,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_015","Never mind that it was far too late. The Ascians' puppet, fearing corruption... Absurd, don't you think?"
64,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_Q1_000_016","What will you say?"
65,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_A1_000_017","You're no monster, Cyella."
66,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_A1_000_018","Part of you always wanted Ardbert to succeed?"
67,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_A1_000_019","..."
68,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_020","You are kind to say so."
69,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_021","Succeed in slaying the monster, you mean? I wish I had. Would that I'd been a traitor only to myself─I could've believed my heart was in the right place, if nothing else."
70,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_022","Absurd, yet in no way amusing. I agree."
71,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_023","Above all, I was naive to think that the memoria would be safe in my former quarters, even once they were rendered inaccessible to mortal interlopers. "
72,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_024","Sin eaters must have been drawn to the memoria's concentrated Darkness. They would have provided enough Light to break the seal─and suitable fodder for the fiend in its newfound freedom."
73,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_025","In sparing the First from its wrath, you have prevented untold devastation."
74,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_026","I know that words will not absolve me. Yet, as one who draws breath upon this star, I offer them nonetheless."
75,"TEXT_KINGDD104_05408_CYELLA_000_027","Warrior of Darkness... Nay, Warrior of Light. I thank you."
