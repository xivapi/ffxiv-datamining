1,"TEXT_KINGRA302_05436_SEQ_01","Your first opponent of the heavyweight division is Vamp Fatale.

58,"TEXT_KINGRA302_05436_YAANA_000_110","You might not be aware, but Vamp Fatale and Honey are bitter rivals. They snipe at each other constantly, and when they fought in an open-weight bout, it was <Emphasis>ugly</Emphasis>."
