0,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_00","A stylish Dreamer is smiling at you. Already, your day has improved.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_01","The stylish Dreamer is none other than Jihli Aliapoh, founder of the imminent Hatching–tide festivities. This year, Jihli's prophetic dream featured golden eggs that floated up from thick swathes of flora, prompting the creation of an egg hunt through the Black Shroud's foliage. Jihli's cohort, Nonotta, was charged with preparing the arena for participants, but enough time has passed without word of the proceedings for Jihli to become worried. She tasks you with finding Nonotta, who may have returned to Gridania.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_02","You find Nonotta in the aetheryte plaza, boasting an adorable pair of chicken sunglasses and no little consternation. Apparently, the arena the Dreamers thought to use for their egg hunt has been overrun by a plant so stubborn it cannot be trimmed or culled, leading Nonotta to believe the flora may be a variation of potentially dangerous leafkin. Accepting a piece of the peculiar plant, you head to the Carline Canopy to question visitors on their knowledge of its source, while Nonotta heads for the Botanists' Guild."
3,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_03","The leaf in your possession seems likely to belong to a strain of flytrap that easily regenerates upon being cut, and you are not the first person to inquire about bizarre plantlife─an eccentric alchemist came seeking similar information not long before you did. Having learned all you can, you return to the aetheryte plaza to share your findings with Nonotta."
4,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_04","The Botanists' Guild has determined that the leafkin in question is so resilient that the pieces in your possession are technically still alive. Shelving that disturbing notion for the time being, you share what you discovered with Nonotta, and the two of you agree that following up with the eccentric alchemist seems as promising a lead as any."
5,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_05","Herberin the alchemist is as eccentric as rumor holds, but passionately offers his assistance in creating a concoction that might help combat the stubborn leafkin. Indeed, he has barely finished agreeing before he dashes off to purchase the necessary ingredients, Nonotta trailing in his wake."
6,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_06","Between Herberin's brilliance and Nonotta's garden scythe, you have all you need to begin culling the intrusive leafkin in earnest. Nonotta goes on ahead to secure transportation, so when you are ready to clean up the egg arena, make your way to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
7,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_07","All is in readiness for some much needed Sprig Cleaning. Speak with an egg usher in Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre or the Acorn Orchard to swing your scythe and reap the rewards."
8,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_08","Many a stalk has fallen by your blade. Speak with Nonotta to debrief from your mission."
9,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_09","Nonotta praises you for a job well done and Herberin seems delighted with not only the results of his alchemical solution, but the copious amounts of floral samples your mowing has produced. As the Elezen skips off to study to his heart's content, you and Nonotta report back to Jihli Aliapoh to let her know the current state of Hatching–tide affairs."
10,"TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_10","Jihli is surprised to hear of the trouble regarding the arena, but glad that the leafkin problem has been resolved, freeing up the arena for the egg hunt that will reenact her prophetic dream. Just as she expresses a wish to thank Herberin for his assistance in the matter, the alchemist in question comes tearing in, proclaiming a profound discovery. Not only has he managed to cure the injury inflicted upon his eyes by the very leafkin you just finished culling, but he claims great promise in its properties of regeneration. Alchemy as he knows it may be entering a golden age, and this, Jihli realizes, is the true meaning behind her dream, the golden eggs a representation of rising hopes for the future.

Thanks to your efforts, Hatching–tide festivities may now begin in earnest, but the egg arena may need a trim every now and again. Stop by for Sprig Cleaning whenever you have a moment, and enjoy the rest of these spring celebrations."
