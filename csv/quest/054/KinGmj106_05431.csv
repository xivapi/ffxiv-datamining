50,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_EYANEY_000_002","Would you check on her? She started off in the direction of town hall."

59,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_RESIDENT05431_000_034","I presume you mean Krile. Had a grand old chat with her earlier."

62,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_RESIDENT05431_000_037","Bit awkward, striking up a conversation after that. And it'd been a while since I talked to anyone I haven't known my whole life..."
63,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_RESIDENT05431_000_038","She's a kind lass. Good at putting folks at ease, like Miayli. I quite enjoyed telling her about the city."

66,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_RESIDENT05431_000_041","I reckon she'd welcome the company of a good friend right now."
67,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_RESIDENT05431_000_051","Good place for pondering, that canal. Maybe that's why she went that way."

71,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_KRILE_000_071","Trifling though it was, I feel that the work we've done has helped me gain a better understanding of Treno. The countless small actions taken by myriad people every day are what make a place what it is, after all."
72,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_EYANEY_000_081","I'm glad you're both back safe and sound!"
73,"TEXT_KINGMJ106_05431_EYANEY_000_082","Now we can relax until my brother does the same. With your friend escorting him, he can't get himself into too much trouble...unless he tumbles down the stairs into town again, I suppose."
