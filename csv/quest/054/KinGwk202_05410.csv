1,"TEXT_KINGWK202_05410_SEQ_01","While you and Searchingway are discussing Phaenna's treacherous terrain, Namingway returns from making his rounds, confident that he has now named the entirety of the star. As with Sinus Ardorum, he invites you to take a tour with him, and Searchingway happily sends you on your way."
2,"TEXT_KINGWK202_05410_SEQ_02","The grand tour of Phaenna will start at Glassblowers' Beacon. Together, you and Namingway seek out a good, clear view of the area.

※You must be accompanied by Namingway to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_KINGWK202_05410_SEQ_03","Namingway expounds on how the sheltering properties of the Glassblown Grotto's dome gave rise to its name, emphasizing that it provides an ideal location for a base of operations. Fragile though the works of man and Loporrit may be, Glassblowers' Beacon has undoubtedly proven itself the atelier in which the initiative's future will be shaped, just as he anticipated."
4,"TEXT_KINGWK202_05410_SEQ_04","Your next destination is the Soda-lime Float, which─contrary to what the name suggests─is most certainly <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> potable. Within this stream of liquid glass are equally deceptive “fish” formed of glass and condensed aether, but lacking the qualities typically associated with fauna. For now, “arcane entities” appears to be the closest classification of these piscine impostors."
5,"TEXT_KINGWK202_05410_SEQ_05","To the southwest, it transpires that Fusingway Vent was named for yet another glassworking technique because, as with so much on Phaenna, the magma within contains nearly enough silicon to be considered molten glass. He further warns you not to dawdle in the vicinity of said magma, lest the vacillating temperatures take you by surprise and result in the melting of the soles of your shoes (or worse)."
6,"TEXT_KINGWK202_05410_SEQ_06","You follow Namingway to the top of the Iridized Rise which, as he tells it, was named for the rainbow colors of its many glossy stairs. After speaking much and more of Phaenna's almost-plants, he reflects on the many questions that the star raises in his mind─questions that he entrusts to future generations to answer."
7,"TEXT_KINGWK202_05410_SEQ_07","Back at Glassblowers' Beacon at last, you are ushered to an unexpected final stop on your tour: the Phaenna Stellascope. This massive magnifying device has already enabled the Cosmic Exploration Initiative to detect stars beyond Phaenna, some of which Searchingway hopes may yet harbor intelligent life in spite of Meteion's dire proclamations. Thus does the initiative's attention turn to finding the ideal candidate for the <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis>'s next voyage."
