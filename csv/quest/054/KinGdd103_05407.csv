Even as some mystery yet lingers around the final fiend you dispatched and the innermost chamber, the fae wards are reinstated by Titania's hand, and you are thanked profusely for a job well done in service to Il Mheg. No matter where your journey leads, be assured that your beautiful branch is guaranteed to follow."
