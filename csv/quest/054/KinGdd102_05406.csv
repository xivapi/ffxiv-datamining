1,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_SEQ_01","The rhyming Fuath is keen to hear your progress within the churches of the First Light. Your description of the great sin eater in clerical robes prompts them to send for the king, and as the two of you await Titania, Aenc Daen explains why you are able to summon the Madbloom to your side by burning juniper incense. It seems the scheme hinges upon your beautiful branch's past life as a mortal─a life they willingly forfeited─and their status as one who might have once received First Light funeral rites. In any case, once Titania arrives to hear your report, they are less than surprised. According to their research, the church's last archbishop was allegedly slain by sin eaters, but Aenc Daen postulates that the cleric, in fact, turned. In a time rife with difficulty for the church, the truth was likely sealed away along with the transformed archbishop, who continued to wander the halls of chapels near and far, hoping against hope for oblivion."
2,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_SEQ_02","You have laid to rest the menace causing trouble in Il Mheg, but Aenc Daen reports that the fae barriers are still in place around the church. What this portends is yet unclear, but journeying further down the pilgrim road may lead you to greater answers─and greater threats. "

77,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_FEOUL_000_042","Among them we found records of a great archbishop's passing─before the fall of Voeburt. His death dissolved the church's hierarchy, as no successor could be named."

81,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_FEOUL_000_046","I believe so. The vestments of the eater you encountered match those in the archbishop's portrait all too well."
82,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_FEOUL_000_047","After turning, he must have been locked away where none could find him. Fated to wander the ruins of his faith forevermore."

88,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_AENCDAEN_000_053","History shall inter the First Light beside him, its legacy as brief as lightning in the collied night. Centuries will bury its stone, and millennia will erase its name."

90,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_FEOUL_000_055","You and your comrades once traveled to the stars and back. And as I tracked the pretty glimmer of your mortal lives, I could not help but wonder."

92,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_FEOUL_000_057","The Church of the First Light wove us into their stories─stories repeated for lifetimes on end. Their devotion may well have created us."

98,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_AENCDAEN_000_070","Not exactly hard proof, but you did well enough! Of all the sin eaters likely to organize a funeral, a lonely archbishop does fit the part."

With nothing left for us to fear.♪
Except..."
100,"TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_AENCDAEN_000_072","Except, perhaps─now here's the catch:
Upon the church remains the latch!
The wards that keep us high and dry
Stay mum as to the reason why.♪"

What deigns not suffer any fae?
Alas, once more in chapel lies
The truth behind this ill surprise.♪"
