1,"TEXT_KINGWK201_05409_SEQ_01","With the Moongate Hub expanded to its fullest, the Cosmic Exploration Initiative is prepared to broaden its horizons. According to Searchingway, the <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis> has not only passed its test flights, but successfully ferried a scouting party to its first destination: a star known as “UL 9-6.” When Namingway laments the sterility of such a designation, Searchingway proposes he concoct something more stirring by making the journey himself. But this invitation is by no means exclusive─the new base camp needs all the contributors it can attract, and you have once again been pawpicked as one of them."
2,"TEXT_KINGWK201_05409_SEQ_02","Armed with your artisan's tools, and Namingway with his dictionaries, you arrive at the cosmoport, whereupon Captain Cruisingway guides you aboard her vessel. The engine roars to life, and the <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis> hops its way through the great expanse by way of stellar current. At journey's end, a lustrous star comes into view, inspiring Namingway to dub it “Phaenna.”"
3,"TEXT_KINGWK201_05409_SEQ_03","You and your fellow passengers land safely on the glossy surface of Phaenna. Before you race off to explore the heretofore untouched frontier, however, Searchingway must brief you on its many-faceted environs."
4,"TEXT_KINGWK201_05409_SEQ_04","Searchingway explains that an abundance of silicon has made certain parts of Phaenna sharp to the touch─including, somehow, the weather. Nevertheless, the prospect of mineral resources and undiscovered plant life is too enticing to pass up, for by using Phaenna as a stepping stone, the initiative may take further leaps into the great unknown."
