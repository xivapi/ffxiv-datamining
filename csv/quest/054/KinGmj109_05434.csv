0,"TEXT_KINGMJ109_05434_SEQ_00","Krile is ready to hear more from Miayli─or is she?"
1,"TEXT_KINGMJ109_05434_SEQ_01","You speak with Krile, who is in the process of steeling herself to receive the answers she has for so long sought. Her resolve hardened, she tells your group that the time to speak with Miayli is come."
2,"TEXT_KINGMJ109_05434_SEQ_02","Joined by Lumull and Eyaney, Miayli reveals that her entire family line is descended from the Milalla Speakers of eld─a line that includes Krile, whose mother Alayla was none other than Miayli's beloved sister. It was Alayla's role as Seeker that motivated her both to unlock the key's mysteries and to keep it from falling into the wrong hands, and as her successor, Miayli now feels it her duty to ensure that the relic is safe with you. Thankfully, she is satisfied with your conduct and more than willing to give her blessing that you keep it in your possession. Since Alayla took the historical documents pertaining to the key with her when she joined Preservation, the mayor can provide no further information concerning it─but she can provide Krile with assurances that neither her parents nor her living family would bear her ill will for calling the Source home.

As your comrades make for Overture Plaza, where Miayli has promised you fanfare to accompany your departure, she calls you back for one final word of warning. It is her belief that the key is guided to the hands of its bearers by a mysterious force not unlike fate itself...and if that force has taken an interest in you, you should expect danger to follow."
3,"TEXT_KINGMJ109_05434_SEQ_03","Miayli and her people see you off with an abundance of warmth, while Krile vows to return to visit her relatives and treat the levin-afflicted. All too soon, you are back on the road to Alexandria, but the grateful smiles of Treno's people are sure to remain with you a long time yet."
4,"TEXT_KINGMJ109_05434_SEQ_04","Back in Living Memory, and with greater certainty than ever that the key's secrets are to be found within Preservation's trove, your comrades make plans to check in with Shale once more. First, however, you must escort Sphene back so she may resume her queenly duties."
5,"TEXT_KINGMJ109_05434_SEQ_05","Though Gossan has a few stern words for Sphene regarding her unannounced absence, she manages to smooth it over with talk of reestablishing relations with Treno. Stressing that you should not hesitate to seek her out should the need arise, she and her aide depart─to be replaced moments later by Shale who, as it transpires, was on her way to the containment complex to review the partially decrypted data in its full context. Y'shtola immediately volunteers to join her, and they head off, promising to inform you the very moment they have conclusions to share. Krile, too, will be occupied for a time with her porxie project, so you find yourself free until you are inevitably called upon once more."

89,"TEXT_KINGMJ109_05434_SHALE_000_073","They could be. Though our work isn't done yet, we've made progress on the decryption. I was on my way to the containment complex to review the data in situ."
