1,"TEXT_KINGWZ201_05411_SEQ_01","Successfully availing herself of your free time, Mumukko expounds on the source of her current predicament─and your impending volunteer assignment. While collecting feedback for a postmortem review, she and her management partner, Phasingway, identified a source of potential trouble: project leader Commandingway and magitek specialist Justa. As Mumukko tells it, the two are meant to be upgrading and refining the initiative's machinery, but are strangely reticent to reveal the details of their work, possibly in fear of disciplinary action. For that reason, she and Phasingway request that you approach the pair as a peer and learn what precisely is in the works."
2,"TEXT_KINGWZ201_05411_SEQ_02","As soon as you ingratiate yourself with the pair, it becomes apparent that Commandingway and Justa have abandoned their good sense somewhere out in the great expanse. You witness an impassioned discussion in which each proposes increasingly more fanciful mech upgrades utterly divorced from the needs of the initiative─until management seizes an opportune moment to interrupt. Once expectations for Justa have been firmly reset, they drag Commandingway off for what will presumably be an even stricter scolding."
3,"TEXT_KINGWZ201_05411_SEQ_03","Fortunately, by demonstrating an understanding of where they went wrong and a deep respect for their leadership position, Commandingway manages to escape Mumukko and Phasingway mostly unscathed. Phasingway remarks that the incident is all too representative of the state of the initiative at present, and you are left with the impression that you ought to keep an eye out for others that may be struggling─as well as the mysterious “guest” that is soon to arrive."
