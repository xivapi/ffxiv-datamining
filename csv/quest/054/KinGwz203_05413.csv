49,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_002","We're planning to conduct a high-altitude test flight. Though it's seldom necessary during standard operation, vacuum suits are equipped for it."
50,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_003","Until recently, manned flights were prohibited─a safety precaution due to the difference in magnetism levels between Phaenna and Sinus Ardorum."
51,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_004","Now that we have significantly fewer project drones whizzing about, however, it should be possible to establish a safe flight path through areas with low magnetic interference without risk of collision."
52,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_005","The trouble is, we're still required to fly in pairs in case of emergency. I should love to have someone of your skill in the air with me!"
53,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_006","Fantastic. Let me know when you're ready to strap in!"
54,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_010","All set? Then let's start the test flight. Just follow my lead, and try not to lag behind!"
55,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_SYSTEM_000_011","As it will take several minutes to establish a safe flight path, you may wish to cancel any pilot applications or pending Duty Finder registrations."
56,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_Q2_000_000","Board the vacuum suit?"
57,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_012","Exercise caution near the grotto entrance, as personnel and supplies are concentrated there. Any malfunction would be disastrous."
58,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_013","Before you panic, however, know that these suits underwent a rigorous inspection for that very reason. Let's continue on!"
59,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_014","We should be well outside the drones' flight path here, but nevertheless, let's check our visuals..."
60,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_015","Sufficient distance confirmed! Onwards, then."
61,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_040","Next, let's see what happens when we cut across the river to the volcano."
62,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_041","We'll need to listen carefully for any sign of engine trouble, but in the meantime, we can enjoy the scenery."
63,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_016","Around here we can expect turbulence at high altitudes. Hot volcanic air tends to rise sharply."
64,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_017","Granted, vacuum suits are designed to handle it─to a degree. I would be more concerned during a heavy glass storm."
65,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_042","Excellent. Now that the flight path has passed inspection, let's test out the automatic recall system!"
66,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_018","Here we are, safe and sound. That concludes the test flight!"
67,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_019","Do you have any thoughts or questions about the process?"
68,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
69,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_A1_000_001","What a phenomenal flight path!"
70,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_A1_000_002","I enjoyed the scenery."
71,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_A1_000_003","Any possibility of solo flights?"
72,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_A1_000_004","I would have liked to dismount partway..."
73,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_021","I'm glad you liked it! Though our routes may be limited, these flights still provide a valuable opportunity to survey large swaths of Phaenna from the air."
74,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_022","For some research cases, a drone recording of the terrain simply does not compare to live observation. And there are times when repeating the same route may actually be a boon!"
75,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_023","I cannot deny that there are many restrictions in place for the sake of safety. But it was a test flight, you understand."
76,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_024","Our priority is to find a solution in the event that lower altitudes become unsafe. Over time, we'll conduct more tests to facilitate independent observation."
77,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_025","I appreciate your input, however, and will bear it in mind for the future!"
78,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_026","After you've had a moment to settle your stomach, speak to me to collect your compensation."
79,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_030","Let me pull out your payment─with apologies for the brief delay. The gil sack has met with some misfortune upon being opened in front of recently disembarked pilots in the past, you see."
80,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_031","As for the suits, they are exporting their data from the flight as we speak. We'll pair that with your feedback to improve future operations."
81,"TEXT_KINGWZ203_05413_ASSISTANT05413_000_032","The route seems quite safe, but it will require further testing before we can offer it to the entire initiative. We're bound to get some use out of it in the meantime, though!"
