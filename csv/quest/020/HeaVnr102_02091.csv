1,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_SEQ_01","On speaking with Biggs and Wedge, you learn that the Illuminati have taken exception to your previous incursion into their territory, going so far as to call for your death. Unfortunately, you have no choice but to invade their fortress again for the good of the realm. Steel yourself to enter the colossus.

※The Cuff of the Father can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_SEQ_02","You have felled the Illuminati forces that sought to block your path. Leave them and the area behind you."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_SEQ_03","On your way out of the colossus, you encounter Cid, Mide, and Roundrox, who have taken the opportunity to survey the interior. As you look on, the treasure hunter searches through the belongings of a fallen goblin, seemingly in vain. When Cid subsequently asks what she is looking for, she tells him that her prize is the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>...just as the goblin machinist suggested during your encounter with Quickthinx Allthoughts. The tome, written some hundred years past, apparently holds the plans for a variety of technological wonders. Chief among them is the invention known as “Alexander”─a walking citadel designed to serve as a bastion of reason and logic. Plainly, it is this ideal that gave form to the Illuminati's primal. Return to Biggs, and relate all that you have learned."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_SEQ_04","Biggs listens intently as you recount your tale. Though plainly impressed by the idea of a walking fortress, he bemoans the Illuminati's reckless approach to realizing the design. Bastion of reason and logic or not, it is a primal, and must be destroyed."

65,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_MIDE_000_506","But most remarkable of all are the plans for a walking citadel. It was to be a beacon of logic and reason for all the world."

67,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_MIDE_000_508","The design catered for every needful thing, from warm beds to crops of grain. Its occupants would never have to leave. And all in a fortress on feet, impenetrable and ready to move at a moment's notice."
68,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_MIDE_000_509","The citadel was meant to bear the most brilliant scholars and artificers of the age to all four corners of the world, that they might set about unraveling the mysteries of creation.

72,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_MIDE_000_513","They would use it to take control, most likely. Create a world ruled by a few chosen scholars. Unless I'm mistaken, that's why the Illuminati exist."

...Not that I don't sympathize, of course. I wonder what she'd say if she had to work under the chief...?"
83,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_BIGGS_000_650","This <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis> sounds amazing. A walking citadel's one thing, but a <Emphasis>self-sustaining</Emphasis>, walking citadel...? Genius! It's just a pity the Illuminati had to go and make a bleedin' primal out of it."
84,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_BIGGS_000_651","From what I understand, this “Alexander” was active for no more than a few seconds─that's <Emphasis>seconds</Emphasis>─and it nigh drained the hinterlands of aether. Imagine what it'd do if it wandered the whole bleedin' <Emphasis>world</Emphasis>..."
85,"TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_BIGGS_000_652","I don't think Roundrox realizes how much danger we're in here. Too busy hunting for new treasures. Probably for the best, though, eh?"
