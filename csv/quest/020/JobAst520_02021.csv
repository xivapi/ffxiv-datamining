1,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_01","Jannequinard and Leveva's symposium on Sharlayan astrology is to be held in Falcon's Nest─a small fortified hamlet in the Coerthas western highlands. Travel to the remote location beyond Snowcloak and find Jannequinard."
2,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_02","No one in the hamlet was made aware of the symposium, and now you and your companions must scramble to find someone─anyone─willing to attend."
3,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_03","While speaking with an aged resident of Falcon's Nest, a terribly wounded knight returns from a scouting mission. Use Aspected Benefic on the man before he succumbs to his injuries."
4,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_04","Your spell has an almost immediate effect; however, it seems that the knight's companions are still out in the field. There is no time to wait for a mustering of the garrison. You will have to find the wounded knights yourself and heal them before the heretics who attacked finish the job."
5,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_05","You find one of the knight's comrades surrounded by heretics, but are quick in driving the men off. Use Aspected Benefic to heal the wounded knight so that he may survive to fight another day."
6,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_06","The knight makes a miraculous recovery and is able to return to the hamlet on his own. Find Jannequinard and tell him of your adventures."
7,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_07","Jannequinard is delighted to hear that the garrison mean to attend the symposium. He wonders, however, where they might be. Seek out the guards and tell them the event is about to commence."
8,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_08","You find the knights you aided, but they stumble over their words as they conjure up a pitiful excuse as to why they cannot attend. Proceed to the location of the symposium and let Leveva know the garrison will not be coming."
9,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_09","Leveva cancels her speech upon learning that no one will be present to hear it. Jannequinard─an expert at failure─is not as disconcerted by the turn of events as the lady, and feebly tries to comfort the group before packing up his things and returning to the Athenaeum. Perhaps he has an idea of what your next step should be."
10,"TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_10","You speak with Jannequinard at the Athenaeum about Leveva's father. He, in turn, tells you about the murdered astrologian of whom the elder resident of Falcon's Nest spoke, and how that man was Jannequinard's friend and one of the reasons he still fights to spread Sharlayan astrology throughout Ishgard.

※The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 54."

The three of us have been spending the last bell speaking with whomever will listen, inviting them to attend the event so at least we won't be speaking to an empty forum. Oh, worry not, my friend.
