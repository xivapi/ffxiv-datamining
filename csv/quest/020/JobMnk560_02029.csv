1,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_01","O'tchakha has been sighted near Eugenia's Spire. Widargelt means to confront her, that he might learn what drives the sect of shadow. Make haste to the North Shroud and join Widargelt near Eugenia's Spire."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_02","You and Widargelt find O'tchakha in a bad way. She explains that her master, a man named H'raha Tia, forced her and D'zentsa to fight one another to the death. Though O'tchakha once saw the man as a father figure, this incident has opened her eyes to his true nature. O'tchakha now fears for D'zentsa, who is still at their master's mercy. She declares her intent to rescue her, and Widargelt pledges his aid. While the two of them make for the safety of the Hedgetree, Widargelt bids you lie in wait near Eugenia's Spire and intercept any pursuers."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_03","You have dispatched the minions H'raha Tia had sent to verify O'tchakha's death. Make your way to the Hedgetree and rejoin your companions."
4,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_04","O'tchakha reveals the truth of the sect of shadow and the ruthless man who now leads it. Though Widargelt harbors hopes that he and H'raha Tia may yet come to an understanding, O'tchakha is not confident that her master will be amenable to discussion. More than likely, it will come to blows, and against a powerful foe who has opened all fourteen chakra─seven each of light and shadow. For now, return to Revenant's Toll and discuss a course of action with Widargelt."
5,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_05","When O'tchakha has recovered, training will resume to open more chakra. In the meantime, Widargelt bids you dedicate yourself to your training, that you might together go forward─as proud disciples of light.

※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 58."

76,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_152","Those who had opened all seven of their native chakra were permitted to duel those who had achieved the same in the opposing aspect."
77,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_153","For generations, such duels were held in great secrecy."
78,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_154","But that ended with the massacre at the Temple of the Fist, when the sect of light was extinguished. And though the sect of shadow survived by virtue of its obscurity, its disciples lost the means to open light chakra."
79,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_155","That is, until Master H'raha Tia learned of the sole survivor of the massacre─you, Widargelt. And that was how Zentsa and I came to you."
80,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_156","Our master taught us that the disciples of light were but a means to an end─a resource to be used. He ingrained in us the belief that our two sects must ever be at odds. And we took him at his word, fools that we were."
81,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_WIDARGELT_000_157","I understand now how things were in the past. How they are in the present. Most importantly, I know that light and shadow were formerly as one. And it may yet be so again."
82,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_WIDARGELT_000_158","I will speak with Master H'raha Tia. Convince him that our schools need not fight. Together, we can rebuild our proud order."
83,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_159","I am afraid he will not be easily swayed. And should it come to blows─as I fear it will─know that his strength far surpasses ours. He is the only person alive who has opened all fourteen chakra."
84,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_160","Recently, I have focused on opening light chakra. Of my own aspect, I have succeeded in opening but six. I am no match for Master H'raha Tia."
85,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_161","You are our best hope, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Even so, you are still one chakra short of fourteen─a small yet decisive difference."
86,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_100_162","If you are to have a fighting chance, you must open the final chakra that eludes you─the seventh chakra of shadow. Alas, this presents a dilemma: there is no way to do so outside of mortal combat."
87,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_WIDARGELT_000_163","There will be another way. There always is. All our chakra may not be open. But we have each other. Together, we may yet rescue D'zentsa."
