1,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_01","Widargelt informs you that he has consulted Professor Erik regarding his newly opened chakra. Alas, the good professor has yet to provide an answer, and so he has no tidings to share at present. Setting that concern aside for the time being, Widargelt invites you to oversee his pupils' training once more. Join him to the west of Revenant's Toll, where training is currently in progress."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_02","You arrive at the training ground to find one of Widargelt's pupils badly beaten. The fellow explains that he was set upon by monks, and Widargelt is convinced that they are the selfsame men who attacked him. Join your brother monk as he gives chase, and make your way to Camp Revenant's Toll."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_03","Widargelt has chased down some of the enemy monks. Tend to them while he continues pursuing those who are still at large."
4,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_04","You have dispatched the monks. Follow Widargelt west of Camp Revenant's Toll."
5,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_05","Widargelt has chased down another group of enemy monks. Once again, tend to them while Widargelt continues giving chase."
6,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_06","You have dispatched the second group of monks. Follow Widargelt to the area northeast of the Tangle."
7,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_07","Widargelt has chased down yet another group of enemy monks. And yet again, you must tend to them while Widargelt continues giving chase."
8,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_08","You have dispatched what you hope is the final group of monks. Follow Widargelt to the area north of the Tangle."
9,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_09","You arrive to find Widargelt locked in a gaze with his leading pupils, D'zentsa and O'tchakha. Explaining that they have no choice, they fall upon you. In the midst of the encounter, you and Widargelt experience the sensation of a new chakra opening. Upon seeing this, D'zentsa and O'tchakha take their leave, but not before revealing the existence of two sects─one of light and one of shadow, the latter to which they belong. Return to Revenant's Toll and speak with Widargelt about these revelations."
10,"TEXT_JOBMNK520_02027_SEQ_10","Wounded by his pupils' betrayal, Widargelt is all the more determined to uncover the truth behind this mysterious sect of shadow and its objective. In the meantime, he bids you focus on mastering your newfound power, which has been unleashed with the opening of your chakra.

※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 54."
