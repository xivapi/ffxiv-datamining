1,"TEXT_CLSWDK580_02000_SEQ_01","Barthovieu has been diligently practicing with his bow, and now believes himself ready and able to kill Nguruvilu. However, just as he makes his way to leave, he can find neither his weapon nor his son. Concerned, Barthovieu bids you seek Philipallais near the Holy Stables. Do so, and hope the boy has not done anything foolhardy."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK580_02000_SEQ_02","You find Philipallais with his father's bow. Barthovieu arrives just in time to stop his son from throwing the weapon away, and demands an explanation. The child tearfully begs his father to stop chasing the dragon. If Barthovieu really must continue, Philipallais asks, why not use a trap to snare Nguruvilu? This way, his father would be able to slay the dragon from relative safety, and attain knighthood as well. Touched by his son's concern and impressed by the plan, Barthovieu enlists your aid in finding the perfect lumber. Since you cannot seem to think of anything, return to Timbermaster Beatin and ask him."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK580_02000_SEQ_03","After listening to your conundrum, Beatin recommends lumber that is flexible as a greenwood, and resistant to cold. The trap will splinter under the wrath of a greater dragon without these qualities, he reasons. However, the timbermaster is unsure what specific kind of wood would be best, and directs you to Roiteloin in the central highlands of Coerthas. Speak with this learned botanist in Skyfire Locks, and see what he has to say."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK580_02000_SEQ_04","Roiteloin thinks for but a moment before suggesting the perfect wood for your project: birch. Cut, plane, and deliver three lengths of high-quality lumber to Barthovieu."
5,"TEXT_CLSWDK580_02000_SEQ_05","Barthovieu accepts the lengths of birch, and thanks you for your time and trouble. He promises to build his trap together with Philipallais, and bids you await the good tidings of Nguruvilu's demise.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Barthovieu upon reaching level 60."
