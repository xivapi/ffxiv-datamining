She seeks a piece of surpassing elegance and grace that is sturdy enough to stand up to daily use, and would like it adorned with gemstones─a ruby, a sapphire, or both. Share your findings with Marcel at Eshtaime's Aesthetics."
3,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_SEQ_03","You relay the client's wishes to Marcel, who reacts with great interest.

4,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_SEQ_04","Marcel is quite taken with the bangle you fashioned, declaring that you indeed possess both the skill and aesthetic sensitivity to realize the ideals of his mentor. Knowing just how demanding his client is, however, he encourages you to hone your skills yet more before commencing work on this most important commission.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Marcel upon reaching level 55."

49,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_001","I have taken the liberty of choosing the song myself. It is a piece of particular sentimental value to my client and her dear husband─and one of the finest pieces from the Songstress's repertoire, if I do say so myself."
50,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_002","As for what physical form the music box is to take, that is for the artisan to decide. I suggest you begin by speaking with our client yourself. Worry not─I have already made the necessary arrangements. She awaits you at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange."
51,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_010","Jeweled Peak awaits you at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange. Now go, and be quick about it─let it not be said that Eshtaime's keeps their clients waiting."

53,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_JEWELEDPEAK_000_031","Yes, I can scarcely wait to see what manner of extravagant masterpiece you will create for me. It will be a masterpiece, yes?

54,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_JEWELEDPEAK_000_032","It will be inlaid with a great gemstone of perfect cut and clarity, yes? Oh, but of course it will! Marcel knows I would settle for nothing less. But what sort of gemstone would suffice? I have always liked rubies...ah, but sapphires are so beautiful as well!"
55,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_JEWELEDPEAK_000_033","Perhaps both, if that wouldn't be too ostentatious? Heavens, I'm starting to confuse myself... Oh, but look at the time! I'm afraid I must be off. Do give my regards to Marcel."

Sturdy enough to be played each day and yet still last as an heirloom to be passed down through generations... Why, that is so exceptionally inspired it's a wonder that I wasn't the one who thought of it!"
57,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_051","As the music box itself will be quite large, we will require stones of impressive size to match. It will be no small task to see that all elements─gold and gemstone alike─are balanced, complementing each other and achieving perfect harmony."

62,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_071","Technical skill and aesthetic sensitivity... An artisan who lacks one or the other is no true artisan at all, but you clearly possess both, and in spades, my good <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>!"
