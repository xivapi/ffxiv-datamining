1,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_SEQ_01","No sooner do you begin conversing with Fufucha than you are interrupted by one Mujih Mewrilah, a reporter from <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>. Apparently, Mujih is planning a series of articles, for which she seeks the guild's permission to follow the doings of a first-rate botanist. With none of your peers available who fit the bill, Fufucha recommends you as the subject for Mujih's story. At the same time, she bids you answer a call for aid from faraway Ishgard, which comes through your friend and colleague Roiteloin. Take the letter of introduction Fufucha has given you, and deliver it to Roiteloin at Skyfire Locks."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_SEQ_02","Roiteloin assures you that a letter of introduction is unnecessary to vouch for your ability, and goes on to share with you the particulars of the call for aid. The petitioner is a botanist named Basyle, who is stationed at Camp Cloudtop in the Sea of Clouds. Roiteloin will arrange for you to meet him at the aetheryte plaza in Foundation; make your way there and join Mujih Mewrilah ahead of time."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_SEQ_03","You speak with Basyle, who informs you of his work at Camp Cloudtop. He labors to alleviate the outpost's reliance on supplies being shipped in, but his attempts to raise crops thus far have met with little success. It is his hope that your abundant knowledge and skilled hands will serve to aid his cause. Before taking his leave, Basyle promises to send requests to you by way of Mujih.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Mujih Mewrilah upon reaching level 53."

67,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_ROITELOIN_000_041","As you will have been informed, the petition comes not from me, but a friend. Basyle is his name, and he is a botanist engaged in settling the Sea of Clouds. That is where your task will take you, and for an extended period of time."
68,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_ROITELOIN_000_042","Some years ago, House Haillenarte established an outpost there, and they seek to make the place self-sufficient.

78,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_MUJIHMEWRILAH_000_090","What took you so long? Your client's been waiting for the better part of a bell!"
79,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_MUJIHMEWRILAH_000_091","Curious how I got into Ishgard, I shouldn't doubt? For now, let it suffice to say: if anyone asks, I'm your retainer!"
80,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_BASYLE_000_092","'Tis a pleasure to meet you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and your lively retainer as well. I'm Basyle. Thank you for making the long journey to Ishgard. Though we still have some ways to go, to be sure."
81,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_BASYLE_000_093","As I'm sure you've been told, I'm a botanist at Camp Cloudtop. We're heavily reliant on supplies being brought in by airship, but I'm trying to change that. Unfortunately, my ventures into farming haven't yielded the results I had hoped for."
82,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_BASYLE_000_094","And so I reached out to Roiteloin, who then reached out to your guild. I'll be turning to your abundant knowledge and skilled hands both."

84,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_MUJIHMEWRILAH_000_096","And a trustier retainer there has never been! I shall convey all your messages without delay!"
85,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_BASYLE_000_097","I'd be much obliged, miss. Now then, I'd best be getting back to my work. I look forward to seeing you again, most certainly at Camp Cloudtop."
86,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_MUJIHMEWRILAH_000_098","I'll remain here in Ishgard and await word from Basyle. Please come by whenever you can spare a moment from your busy schedule!"
