1,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_SEQ_01","The location of the next symposium has been chosen by the Vault, and it is even smaller and more secluded than the last─the Convictory in the lower basin of the Coerthas western highlands. Travel to the camp and speak with Leveva as to how you shall proceed."
2,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_SEQ_02","Leveva feels that the board has been set for you to lose, so she decides not to play by the rules, and instead of holding a symposium, she suggests that you use your astromancy to grant succor to wounded Convictors in the form of Aspected Benefic."
3,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_SEQ_03","The wounded knights you heal make miraculous recoveries. Speak with Leveva and ask her if there is aught else you can do."
4,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_SEQ_04","Leveva is stabbed by a Sharlayan disguised as a wounded Convictor. However, she is no ordinary Sharlayan. A well-timed piece of exposition reveals her to be the same tattooed Sharlayan who has been attempting to kidnap Leveva since she arrived in the Black Shroud. She claims that she has been hired to bring Leveva back to the Old World, but you successfully drive her off before she can act. Join Jannequinard and cast Aspected Benefic on Leveva before her wound takes her."
5,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_SEQ_05","Jannequinard reveals to Leveva that he knew her father, and that he was with him when he was killed. He hands over her father's diary, which the Ishgardian astrologian has been carrying around as a keepsake since the day Rufin passed. With renewed faith in her cause, Leveva decides to remain at the Convictory and use her magicks to heal more soldiers."
6,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_SEQ_06","You speak with Jannequinard one last time. After considering the danger Leveva now finds herself in, Jannequinard agrees to teach you a more potent form of the spell Malefic.

※The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 56."

85,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_LEVEVA_000_052","My grandfather knew the Forum would never allow us to come to Ishgard, and that their “contemplation” over the matter was merely a tactic to stall and discourage us. The stars had spoken to my grandfather, and he was not about to turn a deaf ear to them. I kept silent because I did not wish to let the petty politicking of men thousands of malms to the north stand in the way of our dream─our dream to spread the word of Sharlayan astrology."

When the exodus forced me to return home, he asked if he could accompany me, saying that he wished to try and convince those who once believed in the stars' power to look to the skies again. And we did for several moons. My countrymen were deeply skeptical, and slow to warm to the idea of heathen magicks─some were even rude─but he never gave up on them. Right up until he was..."

I heard a commotion come from his room late one night and went in to check...only to find him bleeding and slumped over his diary, which he was writing when he was attacked. With his last strength, he handed me the diary and asked that I do not blame my people, and that I continue our work. I believe this belongs with you now."

95,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_JANNEQUINARD_000_062","You are right, good man. And so I shall allow this breach of etiquette, but if you fail to address Lady Leveva properly again, I'll have you spit shining the privy back at Durendaire Manor."

He is not going anywhere. And neither am I. I am done with symposiums. That is not what my father wanted. He came here not to speak of astrology, he came here to use it. And so that is what I shall do. There are still many Convictors who can benefit from these magicks."

Gods, sometimes these celestial machinations are simply too grand in scope to grasp! However, if it is as we believe, then we must, as Quimperain so bluntly stated, make sure that naught disrupt us on our path to that fate."
102,"TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_JANNEQUINARD_000_071","Perhaps it is time I revealed to you a more powerful form of Malefic, so that you might be better prepared for the trials that are to follow. Ah, that furrow upon your brow suggests you could have used this spell earlier in your training. In retrospect, I would be inclined to agree. Hah hah!"
