0,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_SEQ_00","Constaint wishes to share with you a rather unusual development."
1,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_SEQ_01","For whatever reason, it would seem that a missive penned by Solkzagyl and addressed to Constaint was sent to Tailfeather in the Dravanian forelands. An acquaintance of Constaint's, Grimold, informed him of this fact, and also insisted that he come to Tailfeather to collect the missive."
2,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_SEQ_02","The missive is rather unusual, in that it appears to have been written weeks ago and sent with a shipment of supplies instead of by more efficient methods. Perhaps most puzzling of all are its words: “I left you a gift near the Hundred Throes. Take it, and become the man you were destined to be.” Though he knows not what to make of it, Constaint heads north to search for whatever it is the deceased paladin hid there for him."
3,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_SEQ_03","Constaint tells you that you are in the right area, though he cannot say for certain. Search the vicinity for anything unusual."
4,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_SEQ_04","Beneath a tree, you find a pair of gallant cuisses, as well as a faded soul crystal. Pondering the items, Constaint begins to question if he is being manipulated somehow, though he does not expound upon his suspicions in detail. He departs for Camp Riversmeet, out of a desire to speak with the one man who could explain─if only he were still alive..."
5,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_SEQ_05","As Constaint contemplates what Solkzagyl intended for him, Jenlyns suddenly arrives, having learned of his predecessor's death from Papashan. As he grieves for Solkzagyl, his soul crystal inexplicably begins to glow, as does yours, and a mysterious burst of aether flows from his crystal into yours. However, before you all can discuss what you have witnessed, you become aware of a cloaked man staring at Constaint and the soul crystal in his outstretched hand. The man disappears before you can discover his identity, but Jenlyns concludes that it was another minion of Death's Embrace, spying on Solkzagyl's pupil to see if he will continue to seek Oathkeeper. Jenlyns is, of course, still determined to reclaim the sword, but as you observe Constaint, staring at the cliff where the man once stood, you cannot help but wonder if he is equally resolved.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Constaint upon reaching level 58."

52,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_GRIMOLD_000_011","Frankly, it's been strange from the start. Who sends a missive with provisions when we've got moogles running about who can do it far faster?"
53,"TEXT_JOBPLD560_02035_GRIMOLD_000_012","Not to mention the fact that bandits have been raiding caravans to Tailfeather for weeks. If it weren't for them moving on, this latest shipment would've likely never arrived. Anyroad..."
