1,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_SEQ_01","Jannequinard has petitioned the chief astrologian of the Observatorium to write a letter to the Vault recommending that Lady Leveva be granted the opportunity to speak before the conclave. Fearing what Forlemort may do to him were he to appear before the man in person, Jannequinard has asked that you travel south in his stead."
2,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_SEQ_02","Surprisingly, Forlemort had readied a letter even before your arrival. Unsurprisingly, it was not because he wished to help Jannequinard, but because he wishes to see the astrologian make a complete and utter arse of himself. Still, a recommendation is a recommendation, and Jannequinard will be pleased nonetheless."
3,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_SEQ_03","The unexpected aid of the chief astrologian set the cogs in Jannequinard's head turning once again. As such, he has once again chosen to miss Leveva's next lesson, and asked that you travel alone to Rathefrost in Mor Dhona─the location of the next gate opening."
4,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_SEQ_04","You arrive in Rathefrost to find Lady Leveva and Quimperain defending a young astrologian from a band of cutthroats. Thanks to your timely intervention, the day is won by your allies. The astrologian thanks you for your aid and Lady Leveva for the constellation map to replace the one destroyed by the bandits. Once the somehow familiar maid has departed, Leveva reminds you of the reason why you are in Mor Dhona, and indicates the spot where you are to survey the skies so that you may open the fifth gate."
5,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_SEQ_05","You have attuned with the Ewer. Return to Ishgard and tell Jannequinard of your fourth─or was it fifth?─bandit attack."
6,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_SEQ_06","Jannequinard does not seem at all surprised upon learning of the attack. In fact, he is more surprised to learn that someone actually took an interest in his field of study...despite the fact he cannot for the life of him remember who this person might actually be.

※The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 50."

While our lovely Lady Leveva has been out making herself a target for every cutthroat and cur in the realm, I have been focusing my efforts on our main objective."
49,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_JANNEQUINARD_000_001","Training? Pah! There'll be time enough for training later. No, I speak of our ultimate goal of spreading knowledge of the Sharlayan school of astrology throughout the Holy See! As you know, the Vault recently turned down my request to allow Lady Leveva to speak before them. But I am not one to be turned away so easily. No, I have a plan! I will entreat Chief Astrologian Forlemort to draw up an official recommendation! The Vault will not so quickly dismiss the words of a man of such standing."
50,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_JANNEQUINARD_000_002","Yes, yes. I know mine uncle loathes me with a passion rarely seen even in young lovers, and there is really no reason why he would aid our cause, being a staunch opponent of change and all... But that does not mean we cannot try. And if we fail? Well, then we can try again. And again. And again, until he is so annoyed that he writes us the recommendation simply to see us out of his thinning hair."
51,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_JANNEQUINARD_000_003","And by we, I mean you. Considering how red the chief astrologian became the last time I visited him, I reason it would be detrimental to mine uncle's health should I arrive at his place of research...and we most certainly would not want him to fall ill or collapse before he penned us that recommendation."
52,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_JANNEQUINARD_000_009","The chief astrologian is a furiously busy man, and despises those who would distract him from his work, especially when the cause for distraction is something he finds trivial. It is fortunate for us that our goal is anything but trivial!"

Not only does the lout have the nerve to ask me─ME─for aid, but he then refuses to do me the common courtesy of accepting that aid in person. Ever the entitled little shite, more worried about his popularity amongst the fairer sex than how his actions disgrace his family's name."
55,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_FORLEMORT_000_022","Ah, the slack jaw. I suppose you are wondering why in the world I of all people would agree to such nonsense. Well, it is simple. Allowing the heathen astrologian to dig her own grave in front of the entire Vault and the Ishgardian astrologian community will only serve to accomplish what I wished from the very start."
56,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_FORLEMORT_000_023","Sharlayan astrology has no place in Ishgard. It has no place in Eorzea. It has no place in this world. It is dangerous and it serves no purpose but to take our eyes off what is truly important─using astrology to free us from the dragon menace and ensure man's return to Halone's Kingdom. Leveva's dithering will only make it that much clearer."
57,"TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_FORLEMORT_000_024","And Jannequinard. Perhaps this will finally spell his downfall. He has only been allowed to continue this nonsense because he is harmless. Too caught up in the luxury of being in line to Count de Durendaire's title to actually put forth any real effort in furthering his, ahem, “cause.” Sharlayan astrology is but an oddity which he can boast about at balls to get him in bed with the slatternly maids of lower houses. His father has protected him thus far, but allowing him and this lady to speak...there will be no brushing under the rug the shame this brings forth. Jannequinard will be finished."
