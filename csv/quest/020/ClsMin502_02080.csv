0,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_00","Adalberta has an attractive proposition for you."
1,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_01","Adalberta has received a request for an expert miner from a company of sellswords currently in Ishgard. The guildmaster strongly urges you to pursue the opportunity. If the thought of prospecting in the north calls to you, speak with Linette to obtain the necessary proof of your affiliation."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_02","Linette hands over the papers, along with her best wishes for your venture. Take the sooty envelope to a knight stationed in front of Fortemps Manor."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_03","Upon realizing who you are, the knight welcomes you to House Fortemps. He informs you that his lord has seen fit to hire foreign sellswords to explore more of Ishgard's territory. You are to join Oschon's Raiders─one such company. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and speak with Haimirich, the company's captain."
4,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_04","Haimirich welcomes you warmly to Oschon's Raiders, and introduces Hatchling, after a fashion. This youngest member of the company clues you in on a tradition of sorts, and gives you the nickname “Professor.” Haimirich bids you wait for the present, as there is no work to be had. However, he asks that you make yourself ready for when it comes.

※The next miner quest will be available from Haimirich upon reaching level 53."

49,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_ADALBERTA_000_001","I know how that sounds, but it's a company that's been charged with doing a mineral survey, and they need an expert's eye. Their captain is an Ul'dahn, too, one who's familiar with the guild's way of doing things."
50,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_ADALBERTA_000_002","Now, Ishgard's territory is untamed and dangerous. But it's worth it to go where no miner has gone before, and I urge you to accept. Linette can supply proof that you're a genuine guild member if you do."
51,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_ADALBERTA_000_010","You should consider the opportunity before you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. If you do decide it's worth your time, speak with Linette for the necessary papers."

53,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_LINETTE_000_031","As you will technically be employed by House Fortemps, I think the courteous thing to do is go to their manor and speak with a knight. The best of luck to you!"
54,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_LINETTE_000_040","I wonder if they will escort you inside Fortemps Manor after you deliver the papers..."

63,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_HEIMIRICH_000_092","That attitude's won us the count's trust. So when the jobs come down from House Fortemps, I'm the one who decides how they get done. Which is to say, my word's the only one that matters. Are you willin' to take orders from me?"

67,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_BABYCHOCO_000_096","<sigh> Cap'n's got <Emphasis>fun</Emphasis> nicknames for all of us. Tradition, he calls it. So what's yours to be? You're a professor or somethin', right? So...what about “Professor”?"
68,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_HEIMIRICH_000_097","...Bloody simple, isn't it? But that'll make for easy rememberin'. All right, Professor it is! An' that wraps up your initiation.
