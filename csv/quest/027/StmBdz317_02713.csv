49,"TEXT_STMBDZ317_02713_ABIKI_000_001","All of us on this island are, in contrast, but humble fishermen. We know not how to fight. This is problematic as lately we have been plagued by terrible monsters, which come to devour the fish from our nets and threaten our very livelihood."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ317_02713_ABIKI_000_011","<sigh> In a time before the Empire occupied Doma, our men were as adept at wielding swords as they were rods. They would gather together in the village then head out to slaughter whoever or whatever disturbed us. Now, however, such action would be considered an attempt at rebellion."
