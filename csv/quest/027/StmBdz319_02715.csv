51,"TEXT_STMBDZ319_02715_MOTOGOE_000_003","There, you will be able to find something known as blessing stones. They are round, white, and just a bit warm to the touch. Bring one back for me, will you?"

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ319_02715_MOTOGOE_000_012","You see, blessing stones are, well, these...gifts left behind by seabirds. You can only find them in remote areas because they are shy creatures that prefer to settle far away from people."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ319_02715_MOTOGOE_000_013","Hm? What do I mean by “gift” you ask? Bahahahaha! That is what we call a pile of bird shite, of course! ...I hope you used gloves!"
