2,"TEXT_STMBDZ426_02749_SEQ_02","Gyorin boasts to you of the Namazu heightened sense of detection gained by way of the glorious barbels about their head and face. He claims to be using this gift to find precious ores for mining. Travel to the Glittering Basin and speak with Gyorin once more."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ426_02749_SEQ_03","Gyorin informs you he has found a choice mining location, but that he is unable to reach it due to a host of monsters in the way. Clear his path of two ruffled hornbills at the Glittering Basin."

According to Gyofu's trained eye, none of the ores Gyorin brought back from the Glittering Basin are of any value. Gyorin leaves in low spirits. Travel to the Glittering Basin and speak with him."
7,"TEXT_STMBDZ426_02749_SEQ_07","Gyorin reaches the conclusion that perhaps his barbels are not made for detecting valuable minerals. He tells you he will once again seek another way to make his name as a merchant."
