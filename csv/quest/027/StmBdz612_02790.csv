49,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_FANATIC02790_000_001","However, I would prefer to discuss it somewhere free from prying eyes. Meet me in front of the Dusk Throne."
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_FANATIC02790_000_010","Thank you for coming. I wish to go to meet with Nhaama. But the road to her is fraught with peril. As such, I need someone to protect me."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_FANATIC02790_000_011","It was only a few weeks ago that both my mother and father were taken from me by the heartless Oronir."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_FANATIC02790_000_012","Their deaths made me realize that I must commune with the Dusk Mother. I shall pray that she strike down those who pretend they are the children of Azim, and that she continue to nurture the Dotharl."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_FANATIC02790_000_013","Nhaama resides in the House of the Crooked Coin to the north. I have heard many tales recently of pilgrims being slain by the monsters that lie in wait along the trail."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_FANATIC02790_000_014","The same must not happen to me. Please, be on your guard. Rendezvous with me further to the north."

65,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_MARAL_000_062","So she has gone to be one with the Dusk Mother. I have no doubt it is what she wanted, but that knowledge does naught to alleviate the pain in my heart."
66,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_MARAL_000_063","The House contains a crystal─a sliver of Nhaama's essence. Those who wish to rejoin with the Dusk Mother throw themselves down into the cavern there. This breaks the cycle of reincarnation."
67,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_MARAL_000_064","The Dusk Mother has always been at the center of my friend's life. The same was true of her previous incarnations."
68,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_MARAL_000_065","To think, if she had been killed together with her family, her spirit could have moved into the child my sister is about to birth..."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_MARAL_000_066","Forget what I just said. I did not mean it. We should take solace in the knowledge that she is finally at peace."
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ612_02790_MARAL_000_067","The envelope her letter came in also contained what seems to be your compensation for helping her. Please accept it as a token of her gratitude."
