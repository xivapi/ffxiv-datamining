1,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_SEQ_01","Hamon has set up five dummies outside the guild, along the Merchant Strip. By way of a warm-up for your lesson, he bids you deal each a Bootshine combo."
2,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_SEQ_02","You have struck all five wooden dummies in the prescribed fashion, much to the delight of the cheering onlookers. Report back to Hamon at the Pugilists' Guild."
3,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_SEQ_03","Hamon teaches you an elementary pugilist combo: Bootshine, True Strike, then Snap Punch. To have you practice this rudimentary-yet-essential combination, the guildmaster bids you unleash Snap Punch three times upon the Qiqirn of the Rat's Nest in central Thanalan."
4,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_SEQ_04","You have succeeded in performing Snap Punch three times on the Qiqirn. Report your success to Hamon at the Pugilists' Guild."
5,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_SEQ_05","Upon your return to the guild, Hamon expresses his delight at your swift progress. At the same time, however, he is concerned for Chuchuto, who he says has been in a rut ever since her best friend and rival, Rurukuta, disappeared. For now, continue to train hard and improve, that Chuchuto might regain her motivation.

※The next pugilist quest will be available from Hamon upon reaching level 15."

49,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_3","Last time, you learned the basics of combinations. Today, I would have you build on that knowledge."
50,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_4","I've set up five wooden dummies outside the guild, along the Merchant Strip. By way of a warm-up, I want you to deal each a solid Bootshine combo. Oh, and don't mind the townsfolk who've gathered to watch."
51,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_10","Well, what are you waiting for? Go and unleash your fists of fury on the wooden dummies!"

53,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_20","So the wooden dummies have felt your wrath? Good! Now we can move on to your lesson."
54,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_22","When you first came to us, I taught you that combinations make a pugilist. What you need to know next is that not any hotchpotch of strikes makes a combination. There's an order to things─a natural flow from one technique to another."
55,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_24","Today, I would have you practice one of the most elementary combinations in a pugilist's arsenal. It goes like this:"
56,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_25","Lead in with a swift <Emphasis>Bootshine</Emphasis> combo! Keep your foe off balance with a <Emphasis>True Strike</Emphasis>! Then bring it home with a blistering <Emphasis>Snap Punch</Emphasis>! With practice, combinations such as this will become second nature. They must if you expect to become an accomplished pugilist."
57,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_26","Now, you'll need some opponents to practice on. The Qiqirn that infest the Rat's Nest in central Thanalan ought to serve. Hit them with Snap Punch three times, and we'll call it a lesson well learned."
58,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_30","Forgotten what to do? Make your way to the Rat's Nest in central Thanalan, and challenge the Qiqirn there. Hit them with Snap Punch three times, and we'll call it a lesson well learned."
59,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_40","Eh!? Y-You've already mastered the Snap Punch combination!? Crikey, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you're a natural at it, just like I was!"
60,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_41","Not to brag, but I happen to be a veritable <Emphasis>storm</Emphasis> of flying fists when the mood strikes me. I'd treat you to a demonstration here and now, except..."

62,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_CHUCHUTO_000_44","Master Hamon has a penchant for regaling us with tales of his exploits, but these never amount to a demonstration. His favorite is his victory over the fearsome marauder, Wideaxe, whom he felled with a combination so swift and seamless, they say you couldn't see his hands...or so the legend goes."
63,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_46","Hah hah hah! That one never gets old!"
64,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_CHUCHUTO_000_47","Our dearest master's humility aside, your progress is truly astounding, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. If I don't keep on my toes, you're like to surpass me in a matter of moons."
65,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_48","Just between you and me, Chuchuto's been in a slump of late. It all began when her closest friend and guildmate suddenly up and disappeared. Rurukuta's the lad's name, and he and Chuchuto joined the guild together."
66,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_50","The two of them were born to refugees, and were orphaned in the Calamity. Not long after I was made guildmaster, I found them on the streets, starved near to death. I did what any decent man would─I took them in, and clothed them and fed them."
67,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_51","When they were strong again, they said they wanted to become pugilists like me, and so I trained them as well. Since then, they've been best friends and rivals both, one helping to raise the other up. <sigh> Would that we knew what's become of Rurukuta..."
68,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_HAMON_000_55","But we were talking about you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You've impressed me yet again, and I hope you continue to do so. Keep up the good work, you hear?"
69,"TEXT_CLSPGL101_00698_POP_MESSAGE","You sense a hostile presence!"
