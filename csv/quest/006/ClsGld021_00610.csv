2,"TEXT_CLSGLD021_00610_SEQ_02","Although Serendipity is pleased with your copper ingot, her assistant, Gigi, declares it unfit to bear night soil. Nevertheless, the guildmaster declares that you have talent, and that you should return once you have gained more experience.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 5."

50,"TEXT_CLSGLD021_00610_SERENDIPITY_000_3","It's simple, really─all you need is copper ore and a wind shard."
51,"TEXT_CLSGLD021_00610_SERENDIPITY_000_4","Our guild supplier, Aistan, can supply you with copper ore. And I gave you a few wind shards along with your hammer. At least, I think I did. If it turns out you don't have any, you'll need to get some yourself."
