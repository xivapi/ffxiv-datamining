1,"TEXT_SUBWIL121_00631_SEQ_01","Caitlyn has asked that you obtain five chunks of tuco-tuco meat and deliver them to her late fiancé's brother Beneger at the Golden Bazaar."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL121_00631_SEQ_02","You have obtained the five chunks of tuco-tuco meat. Deliver them to Beneger at the Golden Bazaar."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL121_00631_SEQ_03","Beneger is happy to receive the tuco-tuco meat, as he will soon need it to feed to a group of hungry miners. He is also dismayed at the idea of Caitlyn remaining in Camp Drybone for the sole purpose of ensuring the annihilation of mongrels. Beneger admits that the death of his brother is tragic, but believes that it is past time Caitlyn moved on with her life."
