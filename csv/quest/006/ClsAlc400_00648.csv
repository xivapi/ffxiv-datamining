Though remaining somewhat vague as to the actual result he hopes to achieve with this ambitious alchemical undertaking, the guildmaster states that he is ready to begin the long and demanding process. There is little left to do but return to your studies while you await its completion...

50,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_002","The ecstatic rush of triumph within my breast has me sufficiently intoxicated. For I have, at long last, unlocked the secrets of the ultimate expression of alchemy!"
51,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_003","After countless hours of research and experiments too numerous to mention, I finally hold in my hand the exact recipe required to effect my heart's desire!"
52,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_004","Come, my astute apprentice, together we shall swing wide the gates of alchemical history. You will aid me by concocting a share of the necessary ingredients."

55,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_010","Well? Do you have those hi-potions of strength for me? Remember: only the most splendid samples are suitable for a process this demanding and delicate."

57,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_021","Merely holding on to the vials, I can feel tendrils of might seeping into my weary frame. You have done well to preserve the power inherent in the limbs of a bog yarzon."
58,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_022","Why, these concoctions would imbue even the scrawniest of men with a strength to rival Rhalgr Himself. If all of the ingredients match this level of quality, our success in this endeavor is assured!"

60,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_024","Well, rather than inconvenience us both with an extremely lengthy and technical explanation, it may be faster for me to simply exhibit the results. This is, after all, the culmination of years of dedication and sacrifice."
61,"TEXT_CLSALC400_00648_SEVERIAN_000_025","It may very well be that my efforts will end in misery. But one must at least make the attempt...or suffer the endless guilt of inaction."
