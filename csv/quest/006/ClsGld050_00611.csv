2,"TEXT_CLSGLD050_00611_SEQ_02","Yet again your craftsmanship satisfies Serendipity, and yet again Gigi sees nothing worthy of praise. As a reward for your efforts, the guildmaster gives you a grinding wheel, which will aid you in your future goldsmithing endeavors.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 10."

49,"TEXT_CLSGLD050_00611_SERENDIPITY_000_2","I'm so glad that you didn't take him seriously when he said your copper wasn't fit for a chamber pot. I mean, really, it doesn't even make sense─you could make a chamber pot out of <Emphasis>anything</Emphasis>!"

52,"TEXT_CLSGLD050_00611_SERENDIPITY_000_5","For this, you'll need copper ingots, which you very conveniently learned to make last time."
