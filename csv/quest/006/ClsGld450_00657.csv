1,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SEQ_01","The guild is awash with commissions on account of the upcoming gala to celebrate the sultana's nameday. Serendipity has asked you to lend a hand by crafting three electrum circlets of the highest quality possible─one with amber, one with spinel, and one with zircon. Prepare the items as requested and present them to the guildmaster for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SEQ_02","The guildmaster approves of your circlets and bids you deliver them to Roroton, but not before speaking with Robert, who should be returning to speak with you any moment. Search for him outside the Goldsmiths' Guild and see what he has to say."
3,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SEQ_03","Robert reveals to you that the Jade Fox may be plotting to infiltrate the nameday festivities and rob the guests in attendance. To prevent this, the Sultansworn have been discreetly investigating the invited guests to determine if one might be the legendary thief. To your surprise, it seems that Roroton has become a prime suspect. Whatever the truth may be, you have a commission to complete. Deliver the circlets to Roroton at the Ruby Road Exchange."
4,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SEQ_04","Unable to resist the temptation, you inquire as to Roroton's true motives for coming to Ul'dah. He confides in you that he is more of an altruist than a businessman, and that his purpose in life is to share the beauty of fine art with others. Return to the Goldsmiths' Guild and report to Serendipity."
5,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SEQ_05","Serendipity has also learned of the rumors regarding the Jade Fox and the nameday celebration. Disgusted that a thief would consider ruining what should be a happy occasion, she hopes that Robert catches the fiend and personally teaches him a lesson.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 50."

53,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SERENDIPITY_000_006","I knew he was ambitious, but I never expected him to rise to prominence so quickly. He's become the talk of Ul'dahn high society, what with his impressive knowledge of the fine arts and his talent for obtaining anything his customers desire."

61,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SERENDIPITY_000_015","Take this one set with amber. Now, amber isn't a gemstone in the traditional sense, since it's composed of fossilized resin and not a mineral. As a result, it requires different techniques to bring out its true potential."
62,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SERENDIPITY_000_016","But you've managed to do just that, creating a piece which is both pleasing to the eye and beneficial to the wearer─especially one who wishes to more effectively channel his earth magicks."
63,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SERENDIPITY_000_017","In contrast to the natural vibrance of amber, the zircon in this circlet imparts a sense of wisdom and worldliness."
64,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SERENDIPITY_000_018","Of course, it also improves one's affinity with ice-aspected aether. Now that I think about it, zircon is not unlike ice, in that the presence of impurities can radically alter its appearance..."
65,"TEXT_CLSGLD450_00657_SERENDIPITY_000_019","As for this circlet set with spinel...I would say it strikes me as a symbol of confidence and power."
