2,"TEXT_KINGBA001_04817_SEQ_02","The jovial bar owner relates to you the story of a group calling themselves the Passage of the Unbound, who gathered at his establishment and were overheard plotting to steal sacred treasures from across Tural and bring them to Eorzea and beyond, where they would be used to stir unrest. Although the group seemed rather eccentric─and otherwise incompetent─it was not long until representatives from various communities visited Xbalyav Ty'e claiming to be subjects of their misdeeds, and it is these people whom Br'uk Evu wishes you to help. Rral Majun stands by to apprise you of their respective circumstances."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA001_04817_SEQ_03","Rral Majun is overjoyed that you are willing to assist, but before she can begin her explanation, your conversation is interrupted by one Raholl Ja. The wizened warrior is equally thrilled to learn a helping hand has come at last, and takes it upon himself to tell you about the capabilities of each treasure and what skills might be required to retrieve it. You discover the Mamool Ja himself is in search of a brave soul, and having heard each person's account─directly or indirectly─you contemplate where your abilities might be best used."
