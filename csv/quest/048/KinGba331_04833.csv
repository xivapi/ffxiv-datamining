1,"TEXT_KINGBA331_04833_SEQ_01","Kuiyki confesses she was unsure you would return after discovering the truth. Relating the difficulties she experienced when first arriving in Kugane, she thanks you for sticking by her. The heartfelt moment is interrupted by the arrival of Samidare's childhood friend, whom you met at the House of the Fierce. In an urgent rush he informs you that Samidare is hiding on Hells' Lid, and bids you investigate the area alone so you may bring your all to bear."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA331_04833_SEQ_02","You survey the area but discern no sign of Samidare. Perhaps he can be found further ahead."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA331_04833_SEQ_03","Once more you survey the area, only to be ambushed by a group of Red Kojin lying in wait. After dispatching them, you decide to forge further ahead in search of any trace of Samidare's presence."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA331_04833_SEQ_04","You survey the area one final time, but Samidare is nowhere to be found. Kuiyki soon arrives, distracting your attention. In the split second you look away, she prepares to stab you, when the real Kuiyki rushes in and tackles her doppleganger, revealing an exasperated Samidare. Fed up that his plan was thwarted once again, he promises to prepare a more thorough method of murder for your next meeting before taking flight as a bird. Kuiyki curses herself for being so gullible, and with horror, realizes that Samidare most likely used her form when he murdered I'toca. Wary there may still be dangers lying in wait, she suggests you both return to Kugane."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA331_04833_SEQ_05","Still reeling from your near untimely death, Kuiyki vows to be cautious of trusting familiar faces, and asks that you do the same. For the time being, she will continue to look into Samidare's possible whereabouts, and will update you when she has news to share.

※The next role quest will be available from Kuiyki upon reaching level 98 in any melee DPS class."
