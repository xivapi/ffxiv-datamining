2,"TEXT_KINGMA101_04860_SEQ_02","Gathered together, you and the others reaffirm your reasons for undertaking the journey west, as well as your support of Wuk Lamat's bid for the throne. Satisfied that everyone is committed to the cause, Erenville suggests you make ready to depart."

Erenville explains that the larger vessel is unable to enter the city's harbor, so you board a landing boat alongside your comrades."
7,"TEXT_KINGMA101_04860_SEQ_07","You at last make landfall in Tuliyollal─much to the relief of Wuk Lamat and her roiling stomach. Upon your arrival, you are accosted by Turali soldiers, who are quickly put at ease by the reassurances of the Third Promise."
