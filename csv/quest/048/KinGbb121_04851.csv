1,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_01","Iq Soq Xmajun has struck again. With Golias already interviewing eyewitnesses, you and Keshkwa go to join him at Fallgourd Float and assist in uncovering potentially vital clues."
2,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_02","The Twin Adders have called for anyone with information relating to Iq Soq Xmajun to make their way to Fallgourd Float, where they may relay their accounts to Golias and other soldiers present. You and Keshkwa volunteer to help by speaking with adventurers who have recently arrived from the forest."
3,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_03","The adventurers all have tales relating to the tural vidraal, which has made its presence known in a variety of locations. Armed with a wealth of fresh information, you seek out Keshkwa to share your findings."
4,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_04","Comparing notes, you discover that the stories of sightings in the East Shroud do not quite match. One of the adventurers that Keshkwa had spoken to claims to have heard but not seen Iq Soq Xmajun, so your mentor suggests questioning him further."
5,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_05","The adventurer with the unusual account explains that although he was near enough to hear the flapping of Iq Soq Xmajun's wings, he did not actually catch sight of the beast. Though it seems a trifling detail, when he mentions that he was carrying Ala Mhigan potpourri at the time, Keshkwa practically leaps with excitement, and rushes off to find Golias."
6,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_06","After further discussion, you conclude that many of those who survived encounters with Iq Soq Xmajun were carrying potpourri containing Gyr Abanian wildgrass. Working on the assumption that the plant's potent aroma kept the beast at bay, you and Keshkwa decide to gather a sizable quantity in Pike Falls, where it grows in abundance."
7,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_07","Though gathering wildgrass is a relatively simple task, it is not without its dangers, as the local wildlife is quick to remind you. Having harvested a sufficient amount, you are eager to share with Keshkwa the fruits of your labors."
8,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_08","Satisfied that you have gathered enough wildgrass for the time being, Keshkwa suggests that you make for Quarrymill, where you have agreed to meet with Golias."
9,"TEXT_KINGBB121_04851_SEQ_09","You return to Quarrymill to find Golias accompanied by Innocent Stork, who has placed an order for diffuser pouches to more effectively disperse the aroma of the wildgrass. Once the pouches are ready, you will be able to drive Iq Soq Xmajun to a location of your choosing. Innocent Stork then asks if, rather than killing Iq Soq Xmajun, it would be possible to capture it instead so that it might be studied. Keshkwa, however, is far from keen on the idea, reminding her of her hunters' failure to outwit the clever beast. Even if it were captured, he is certain that it would escape, and declares that it must be slain without hesitation. Innocent Stork concedes and accepts his argument, but Keshkwa suspects she is hiding something─as is Golias, whom the viper observes to be acting strangely. Hunting Iq Soq Xmajun is challenging enough, but having to do so while questioning the motives of your allies only complicates the matter...

※The next viper quest will be available from Keshkwa upon reaching level 88."
