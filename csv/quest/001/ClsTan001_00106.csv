51,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_4","You'll need circles of leather and animal sinew to accomplish this task. Osgyth can provide the sinew, and I'm sure you recall the method for making leather."

53,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_6","Now, while we have an ample stock of skins, there are other means of procuring your materials."
