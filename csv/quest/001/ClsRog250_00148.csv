1,"TEXT_CLSROG250_00148_SEQ_01","Jacke explains that the remaining treasures are in the possession of the Reformists─an extreme faction of the dreaded Bloody Executioners. The guildmaster then sends you to speak with the ever-moving black marketeer to learn more about these dangerous marks and their plans. Make your way to the House of Sticks in lower La Noscea, and defend yourself against the underworld broker's kobold bodyguards should they seek to impede your approach."

4,"TEXT_CLSROG250_00148_SEQ_04","After making your report to Jacke, the guildmaster prepares to set out for eastern La Noscea with all haste.

5,"TEXT_CLSROG250_00148_SEQ_05","You catch up with the Stray and learn the reason behind her unusual behavior. Speak with V'kebbe at Costa del Sol once more, then make your attempt on the Silver Sorrows."

After defeating the guards and threatening the Ul'dahn merchant, however, your prize is snatched away at the last moment by a well-prepared Captain Milala. Commiserate with Jacke at Costa del Sol."
7,"TEXT_CLSROG250_00148_SEQ_07","As Jacke laments his failure, he is approached by the Yellowjacket captain, who further taunts the guildmaster with the details of her victory. After a heated exchange, it is clear that neither rogue nor soldier intend to forfeit the challenge. Return to the Rogues' Guild and speak with Jacke."
8,"TEXT_CLSROG250_00148_SEQ_08","Putting the loss of the Silver Sorrows behind him, Jacke focuses his gaze on the last remaining treasure─the Black Sarcophagus. He warns that the Reformists are not likely to part with the mysterious object without a significant struggle. Hone your bladework to perfection, and prepare for what promises to be your most challenging job yet...

※The next rogue quest will be available from Jacke upon reaching level 30."
