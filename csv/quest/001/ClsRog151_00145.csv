1,"TEXT_CLSROG151_00145_SEQ_01","Putting himself in his marks' shoes, Jacke hazards a guess as to where the last of the Jolly Merchants will likely be hiding. Head out to the Flock in western La Noscea and search for signs of the remaining slavers."
2,"TEXT_CLSROG151_00145_SEQ_02","After discovering a family of villagers tied up amongst the dodo nests, you are confronted by the final gang of slavers. One hectic and feather-filled battle later, the pirates are defeated and the Jolly Merchants no more. See to the well-being of the captive smallfolk."
3,"TEXT_CLSROG151_00145_SEQ_03","As you are tending to the traumatized villagers, you are approached by a trio of Yellowjackets led by one Captain Milala. The Yellowjacket captain appears fanatically opposed to anything with the slightest connection to piracy, and challenges the Rogues' Guild to a contest to justify its very existence. Return to the guild and discuss this development with Jacke."
4,"TEXT_CLSROG151_00145_SEQ_04","You return to the Dutiful Sisters to find Jacke still chafing over Captain Milala's presumptuous challenge. Bound by the code, however, the guildmaster fully intends to reclaim the stolen treasures even if it means dancing to the Yellowjacket's tune. Master the Mug ability and continue sharpening your skills that you might ensure victory for the guild.

※The next rogue quest will be available from Jacke upon reaching level 20."
