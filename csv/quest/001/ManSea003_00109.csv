49,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_2","Firstly, if ye 'ead down a floor then point yer nose to the west, ye'll get an eyeful o' the great glowin' crystal in the middle o' the courtyard."
50,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_3","That's an aetheryte─a device what can move ye from one place to another in the blink of an eye. Ain't no swifter way to travel─providin' there's an aetheryte where ye want to go, o' course."
51,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_4","'Ave a chat with the Yellowjacket on guard down there an' ye'll be treated to a lecture on the workin's o' the device. 'Fore ye do that, though, remember to touch the thing. Strange as it sounds, it won't work till you 'ave."
52,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_5","Second on the list is the marketplace. Ye'll find weapons, armor, an' all yer 'venturin' bits an' pieces fer sale in the district what lies beyond the aetheryte."
53,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_6","Don't go throwin' yer gil around just yet, though, or ye'll get fleeced quicker'n ye can say, “Why's me coinpurse so light?” 'Ave a word with Swozblaet, instead. 'E's the 'ead o' the Merchants' League, by the way."
54,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_7","Give 'im this old octant, an' 'e'll treat ye well."
55,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_8","Fer the last o' me 'elpful 'ints, I suggest ye meet some fellow spell-slingers at the Arcanists' Guild."
56,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_9","I guarantee ye'll learn a few new tricks fer yer tome if ye decide to join their crew. Murie at the front desk is the one to get ye started."
57,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_10","Got all that, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>? Seein' to them three tasks'll take ye on a little jaunt 'round the city, an' 'elp ye work out where everythin' is. Now, I've best be gettin' on. Run along, eh?"
58,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_11","Bugger it! There I go, sendin' ye off without tellin' ye summat crucial. That bloody Calamity's made a right mess o' me memory, I swear. Well, that or the ale... Anyroad, while yer out, if ye 'appen to pass any poor sods what look like they might need yer 'elp, consider givin' their tale o' woe a listen, eh?"
59,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_12","Sounds like a chore, I admit, but ye never know what interestin' opportunities could be lurkin' out there, just waitin' fer ye to stumble on 'em. Fer example, Niniya over yonder's been castin' glances at ye since ye waltzed in.
Why not lend an ear an' see what she 'as to say? Aye, yer like to find yerself runnin' odd errands in the beginnin', but once ye build a reputation as a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> folk can trust, the jobs'll get 'arder an' the rewards more generous."
60,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_13","If ye've the time, I'd also seek the advice o' the Smith 'ere in the Wench.

64,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_22","Aetherytes are crystalline structures that tap into aetherial energies. They are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another."

67,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_25","Once you have expanded your horizons beyond the walls of the city, you will soon find yourself performing the act of attunement as a matter of course."

You are now able to use the Return spell!"

73,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_33","Hm? You bear a gift from Baderon? Whatever could it─ Ah! My octant! By the Navigator, I must have left it behind in the Wench─along with a week's pay and several bells' worth of intoxicated memories!"
74,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_34","I am most grateful to have it back! This tool is a keepsake from my days as a ship captain, you see. Needless to say, your good deed must be repaid, and what better recompense than the wisdom of a master merchant?"
75,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_35","If it is simple and sturdy adventuring equipment you seek, you need look no further than the East and West arms of Hawkers' Alley."
76,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_36","Lest you doubt, each gil you invest in arms and armor will be money well spent. Adventuring is, after all, a dangerous profession by its very nature."
77,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_37","It goes without saying that Hawkers' Alley boasts stalls specializing in the tools of every martial discipline imaginable."
78,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_38","And within but a few steps are bazaars and apothecaries that will most amply supply all your potion and perishable needs."
79,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_39","Our keen-eyed agents procure a frankly befuddling range of wares during their sojourns to distant shores, so it pays to become familiar with the type─and price─of the goods offered by each stall."
80,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_40","Such knowledge will serve you well if your purse is light or your time is short."
81,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_41","Ah, but verbal instruction of this kind will only profit you so much. Experience has ever been the surest teacher─if not the kindest. I invite you to explore the markets for yourself."
82,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_50","Welcome to the Arcanists' Guild. It is here that we research and develop the field of arcanima."
83,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_51","Arcanima is the science of employing “arcane geometries”─intricate patterns that map the unlocked mysteries of existence─to draw forth and manipulate the body's aetheric energies."
84,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_52","Ah, but if I am not mistaken, you already possess some rudimentary understanding of the craft. Shall I deepen your knowledge of our history, as well?"
85,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_53","The roots of arcanima can be traced back to the esoteric calculations practiced by the people of the south sea isles. It was these island folk that first discovered a method to express natural phenomena in mathematical terms."
86,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_54","Building on this process, the existing mathematical formulae were further developed into arcane geometries─precise patterns that allowed a practitioner to weave aether into specific magical effects. The mages who invoked this new form of magic became known as “arcanists,” and the school of arcanima was born."
87,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_55","Many such mages, wishing to expand their understanding of the world, took to the seas aboard trading vessels. Upon their arrival in Limsa Lominsa, arcanists found themselves welcomed into the academic elite, and soon secured positions in the realms of governance and counsel."
88,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_56","The knowledge of an arcanist, however, is traditionally passed on from master to chosen disciple. As such, Admiral Merlwyb, counting several wielders of arcanima among her personal staff, became concerned that this exclusionary practice would lead to the eventual extinction of the art."
89,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_57","So, at the Admiral's express orders, an official Arcanists' Guild was established, and funding was provided for research and training."
90,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_58","The complex and demanding nature of arcanima, however, remains the greatest threat to its own future. If you would continue your study of this challenging discipline, then I must insist that you indicate your commitment to joining our guild."
