It seems the trio of dandified thugs had trailed you back to the guild with the intent of demanding restitution for your recent act of larceny. The rogues make short work of the intruders, but not before the Demolishers' leader reveals a curious fact about the guild's past. Speak with Jacke to conclude your assignment and learn more about the history of the rogues."
