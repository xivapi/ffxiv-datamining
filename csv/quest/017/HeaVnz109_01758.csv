1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ109_01758_SEQ_01","With his subordinates safe, Terremiaux can at last return to his original task─the retrieval of stolen weapons and armor. And to avoid the pitfalls of his initial undertaking, he has devised a plan. First, he will create a diversion to draw the attention of as many Vanu as he can. This will offer you the chance to reclaim the equipment with diminished resistance."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ109_01758_SEQ_04","Laniaitte is relieved to hear the search party is safe and the equipment is all accounted for. Although the Vanu's sudden interest in finer weaponry concerns her, she is glad to have had the aid of such a capable adventurer, and foresees need of your skills again in the future."
