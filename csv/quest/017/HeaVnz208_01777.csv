1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_01","Thanks to Q'yantaa's rising reputation in Tailfeather, Loupard finally has an eager volunteer for the position of her partner. Venture to the southeast of Tailfeather to inform Q'yantaa of the good news."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_02","You find Q'yantaa staring diligently at a rock wall for reasons unknown and unexplained to you. After you inform her of Loupard's good news, she hurries off to Tailfeather before telling you exactly what it was she was doing. Return to Tailfeather and speak with Loupard to finally meet your potential replacement."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_03","The partner that Loupard has found looks uncomfortable in the chocobo hunter's garb, and the disappointment is clear in Q'yantaa's expression. Since he seems hesitant to introduce himself, speak with him to lighten the mood."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_04","It seems Q'yantaa has been busy using her hunter's instincts to find the best places for chocobo hunting, but she seems skeptical of her new partner's abilities. Once again, she asks you to help her hunt. Split up and investigate the trap locations for any signs of chocobos."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_05","Try as you might, you fail to find any trace of chocobos in or around the traps. Return to Tailfeather and inform Q'yantaa of the bad news. "
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_06","Q'yantaa seems surprisingly accepting of the fact that her instincts failed her, and instead she expresses her frustration at Gysol's tardiness. In a sudden show of compassion, her frustration turns to worry that her new partner might actually be in danger, and she resolves to go looking for him with you in tow. Accompany her to find the nervous hunter before some other beast does."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_07","You find Gysol in a surprising situation: cooing over a chocobo hatchling which has apparently been separated from its parents. Despite Q'yantaa's protestations, Gysol resolves to take care of the chick himself, and to give up on chocobo hunting in favor of working in the stables. Return to Tailfeather and inform Loupard of this confusing hunting trip."
8,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_08","Loupard explains that hunters are not allowed to capture chocobo eggs or chicks, but decides to make an exception for Gysol considering that the chick would be helpless without him. With one more person in Eorzea realizing their dreams thanks to the Warrior of Light, you begin your search for Q'yantaa's partner anew."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_001","He's a fresh-arrived hunter that goes by the name of Gysol. I'm thinkin' we should have a li'l trial hunt to see if he and our budding prodigy get along."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_002","'Course, I wouldn't be fool enough to let two greenhorns go out on a hunt unsupervised. That's why I need <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> to look after 'em. How about it, are you keen to go out huntin' with her again?"
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_003","With any luck, she'll be off havin' adventures on her own in no time at all.

76,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_GYSOL_000_063","But this one was separated from its mother. It's bound to starve or get eaten if we just leave it here..."
77,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_GYSOL_000_064","That's why I have to care for it until it grows as hale as Ishgard's mightiest steeds! Aye, I think...I think hunting might not be in my nature."
78,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_GYSOL_000_065","My mind is made up─I'll work in the stables while I raise this hatchling. And I have your hunting instincts to thank for helping me see my path, Q'yantaa!"
79,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_QYANTAA_000_066","Well, I've never been one to tell another how to live... I hope you're better at raising chocobos than you are at hunting them!"
80,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_QYANTAA_000_067","Well, I guess it's time to get back to Tailfeather. Gysol, I'll go with you to make sure you don't fall prey to any beasts along the way!"

84,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_080","Gysol's told me he wants to <Emphasis>raise</Emphasis> chocobos now. It's too bad huntin' ain't his callin', but everyone here is free to make their own choices."
85,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_081","Now about the hatchlin' he brought along... Generally, we don't allow hunters to take eggs or chicks, since if we did, pretty soon the forest'd be nothin' but bandersnatches and dragons."
86,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_082","But it looks like this one's lost its mother, and Gysol seems right adamant about raisin' it himself, so...I think I can make an exception this time."
87,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_GYSOL_100_082","Thank you, Loupard! Q'yantaa, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, if not for you, my true calling would still be a mystery. Though short, I am grateful for our time together!"
88,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_083","Well, looks like Q'yantaa's gonna have to wait a bit longer for her partner... I'll keep askin' around!"
