1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_SEQ_01","You are greeted by an Elezen at the steps to the aetheryte plaza who immediately takes note that you are not native to Ishgard. Never one to pass up the opportunity to share his stories, he offers to show you around and regale you with tales of Ishgard's history. He asks you to meet him at Saint Reinette's Forum if you wish to hear more."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_SEQ_02","You meet up with the elderly Elezen, who proceeds to tell you of the legendary dragoon Saint Reinette for which the Arc of the Humble was named. For his next story, he asks you to speak with him at Saint Valeroyant's Forum."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_SEQ_03","The elderly Elezen tells you of Saint Valeroyant and the Azure Dragoons, those chosen by the Eye to lead the nation's dragoons into battle. Though the statue before you was erected in his image, it has been damaged much like other sections of Foundation. Despite the despoilment, however, the elderly Elezen is not disheartened by what has befallen Ishgard. He has no more stories to tell you, but suggests you speak with Outreguerlain at Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral should your thirst for knowledge remain unquenched."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_SEQ_04","Outreguerlain greets you warmly and speaks with you of the patron saints of Ishgard for which many places are named. Though there is much of Ishgard you do not yet know, he asks for your understanding that it is through their faith that the people of Ishgard have stood united in their struggle against the Horde."

48,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_000","Hmmm... I take it by your garb you are not from here, am I right? The sights of our city must be quite the spectacle. It is a place rich with history─a story for every brick that paves our streets or frames our hearths and homes."
49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_001","There is much to learn of Ishgard, and I suppose I can teach you a thing or two. If you care to listen to this old man's tales, pray meet me at Saint Reinette's Forum."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_010","Ah, so you've come to partake of my company, eh? Then let me start with the statue which stands before you here. This is Saint Reinette, a dragoon of great renown said to have wielded Gae Bolg."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_011","According to legend, a dragon slew her beloved, and naught but its blood could atone for what she lost. After much searching, she confronted the beast, and that would be the last time she wielded a lance.

Upon exacting her revenge, they say she cast it aside on the ground where the dragon was felled, taking up the cloth in its place."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_012","From then on, she devoted her life to uplifting the poor and downtrodden."
53,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_013","I daresay there has never been a man or woman so selfless as she in our history. And so the Arc of the Humble was constructed, that we should never forget her sacrifices."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_014","It's perhaps worth mentioning that we of Ishgard take great pride in the works of masonry adorning our streets. You will come to find figures of great esteem and respect immortalized in some fashion at nearly every turn."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_015","Now then, let us move on to Saint Valeroyant's Forum. I shall await you there."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_020","This is─or rather, was─the statue of Saint Valeroyant, an Azure Dragoon of ages past who once drove off the great wyrm Nidhogg."
57,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_021","Surely you've heard of the Azure Dragoon, chosen by the Eye to lead Ishgard's dragoons in the fight against the Dravanian Horde."
58,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_022","<sigh> But alas, much like this one, a number of statues in our fair capital have been defaced during a recent attack. Not that we could ever forget in whose name they were erected, mind you."
59,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_023","In fact, one could say these disfigurements are like a badge of honor, earned from a clash with our enemy. Quite remarkable, wouldn't you agree? History being made of history, I'd say."
60,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_PIOUSOLDMAN01726_000_024","I'm afraid that is all I have to tell of our dear city, but that glimmer in your eye tells me you wish to know more. Pray speak with Outreguerlain at Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral. I have no doubt he can regale you with another tale of Ishgard's history."
61,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_OUTREGUERLAIN_000_030","Greetings, friend. Halone's blessings be upon you. Ah, you wish to know more of Ishgard's history? 'Tis not often travelers come seeking such knowledge."
62,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_OUTREGUERLAIN_000_031","The Holy See of Ishgard is home to myriad patron saints for which many places are named. In fact, this cathedral was named for the first archbishop to oversee the Ishgardian Orthodox Church."
63,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_OUTREGUERLAIN_000_032","They are a testament to the unshakable will of our people, to our unity in the battle against the Dravanian Horde."
64,"TEXT_HEAVNZ001_01726_OUTREGUERLAIN_000_033","I realize there is much of our people you do not know, and we would not force our views upon you. Rather, we ask you not decry our pursuit of our destiny─the righteous path we walk by the grace of Halone, our truest savior."
