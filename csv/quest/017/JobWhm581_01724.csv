1,"TEXT_JOBWHM581_01724_SEQ_01","Eschiva has given the hunk of tainted flesh over to your keeping. Make your way to Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud, and present it to Raya–O–Senna."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM581_01724_SEQ_02","Having dared to hope that the Seedseers will bestir themselves, Eschiva is furious when it becomes evident that they mean to have you bear the burden of dealing with Alaqa. She storms off, and the two Seedseers are left to ponder her words. Though the law binds them to the forest, they concede that it will all count for naught if the people lose faith in them. For the time being, sit tight while A–Ruhn examines the piece of tainted flesh for clues.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna upon reaching level 60."
