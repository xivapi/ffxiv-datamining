1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ024_01749_SEQ_01","Gildon informs you that, according to reports from the other men, your tussle with the Vanu atop the cliff northeast of camp was not a one-off encounter. In fact, they believe the Vanu are conducting routine surveillance of the area. The only question that remains is to what end, and Gildon requests your assistance in finding the answer. Travel northeast to where you were assaulted by the Vanu and search for clues to what they are planning."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ024_01749_SEQ_02","Returning to where you last encountered the Vanu scout, another has taken its place, peering out into the distance toward Camp Cloudtop. You make short work of the beastman spy, and find a strange bone in his possession."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ024_01749_SEQ_03","You pick up the bone and decide it may be a clue. Return to Camp Cloudtop to have Gildon examine it."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ024_01749_SEQ_04","You return to Camp Cloudtop and hand over the gnawed bone to Gildon. Inspecting it more closely reveals a strange pattern scratched into its surface. With this newest clue, the search for the truth has sparked a fire in Gildon. Perhaps this will lead to rekindling the spirits of his fellow cavalrymen."
