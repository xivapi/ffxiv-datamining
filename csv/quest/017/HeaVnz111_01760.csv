1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ111_01760_SEQ_01","Jantellot wants you to know what life is like at the Convictory, and suggests a bit of hunting as an example. Though the Convictors slay dragons, Jantellot recommends a warm-up before confronting the Dravanian Horde itself. He suggests hunting rheums instead. Locate and slay three rheums."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ111_01760_SEQ_02","You venture out into the highlands and slay the rheums as instructed. Return to Jantellot at the Convictory and let him know that you are ready for something a bit more draconic."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ111_01760_SEQ_03","Jantellot congratulates you on your kills. It seems that the rheums were no match for you. But dragons are another thing altogether. He suggests you speak with him again some time if you want to try your hand at the real thing."

Unless you've been at it for years─like I have─I think it prudent to start with something simple and then work your way up to dragons. I suggest rheums. Slay three of those, then come back here.
