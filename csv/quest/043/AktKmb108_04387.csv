1,"TEXT_AKTKMB108_04387_SEQ_01","The tragedy that unfolded on the Eblan Rime has clearly left its mark on Alphinaud and Alisaie. Your hearts heavy with guilt and sorrow, you return to Camp Broken Glass to relay these unfortunate events."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMB108_04387_SEQ_02","Lucia and the others are shocked to hear the outcome of your first encounter with Garlean locals. Making a conscious effort not to dwell on the matter, the conversation turns to the collapse of the Empire. You come to the realization that some few were spared from being tempered by devices known as radios, which, perhaps more by coincidence than design, possess similar properties to the warding scales. The discussion is interrupted by the discovery of an intruder in the camp─a young Garlean soldier named Jullus who was caught stealing provisions. Despite his initial hostility, he is eventually persuaded to take you, Alisaie, and Alphinaud to parley with his commander."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMB108_04387_SEQ_03","Lucia offers a few parting words, including cryptic comments to observe proper social etiquette, and that Thancred will be worried for your well-being. As Jullus is within earshot, you can only surmise it is a not-so-subtle reminder to take no action against the soldiers regardless of the circumstances─you are to observe their disposition only; and should you come to be in need of assistance, a concealed Thancred will likely be nearby to offer it. You ponder this possibility as you prepare for a journey across the snowy plains."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMB108_04387_SEQ_04","Jullus decides to wait until your party is outside of Camp Broken Glass before revealing even the slightest hint as to where you are heading, for fear your allies might surmise the location of his base of operations. For the time being, you comply with his wishes and follow him until you are all out of earshot."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMB108_04387_SEQ_05","Jullus explains the route you must take in order to approach his faction's headquarters. As he is still extremely wary around you and the twins, he forbids you from drawing your weapons in his presence. In order to keep an eye on them, Jullus instructs Alphinaud and Alisaie to take the lead, while you join him in bringing up the rear.

※ If you part ways with Jullus or fall behind Alphinaud and Alisaie, return to the starting point and speak with Jullus to try again."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMB108_04387_SEQ_06","You manage to evade the local wildlife and finally reach Liminal Station IV. The sense of accomplishment is fleeting, however, as Jullus then reveals that this location is nothing more than a brief stop for him to ensure that none of your comrades are attempting to follow in violation of the agreement. Satisfied you are alone, he bids you continue along to your true destination."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMB108_04387_SEQ_07","The next part of your journey will take you near the remains of a sprawling residential district. With hordes of tempered soldiers and civilians prowling the streets, your party will need to move swiftly to sneak past without incident."
