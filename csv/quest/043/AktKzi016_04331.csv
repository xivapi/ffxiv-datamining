50,"TEXT_AKTKZI016_04331_ANAIDJAA_000_002","However, such keenness of eyesight requires─for lack of a better term─upkeep, which comes in the form of special eye drops. After all, what creature can sit unblinking and wide-eyed for days on end without help? So, might I ask you to dole out said medication?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZI016_04331_ANAIDJAA_000_003","How good of you to be so obliging. The skatenes are perceptive creatures in both sight and mind, and will take to you instantly once they know you've experience in caring for even one of their kind."

73,"TEXT_AKTKZI016_04331_ANAIDJAA_000_041","The skatenes do not stay long in any given location, but rather fly through Labyrinthos, moving from perch to perch. Should you happen to see one, count yourself fortunate. They can be a rare sight."
