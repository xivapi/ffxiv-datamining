49,"TEXT_AKTKZH018_04313_GRADUATESTUDENT04313_000_001","I see. She and I are students of Akadaemia Anyder, and we had intended to spend our downtime visiting Elpis together."

She can be a bit─how shall I put it?─scatterbrained, so she may well have simply got lost on her way back."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZH018_04313_GRADUATESTUDENT04313_000_003","I would rather not search for her myself, for what if she comes back while I'm away? So, if it isn't too much trouble, perhaps you would be so kind as to look for her?"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZH018_04313_GRADUATESTUDENT04313_000_004","Like us, she won't be wearing a mask, and so should stand out a touch. You'll find her in the area of Philomythes Notos in all likelihood. If you do come across her, could you help her out a bit? See she makes it back?"

56,"TEXT_AKTKZH018_04313_FOREIGNER04313_000_032","I feel terrible leaving her like that, but I'd clean forgotten a task from one of my professors. I rushed back to collect the item I was asked for─which I found, thankfully─but got rather turned around when attempting to return."
