The inquisitive Omicron is eager to understand a certain phenomenon."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_SEQ_01","You are asked to help the inquisitive Omicron with an experiment to see how loved ones can positively impact one's capabilities in combat. As this opportunity is too good to pass up, you patiently await its return with its “consort” of choice.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_SEQ_02","When the inquisitive Omicron returns, the two of you quickly decide that the most attainable means by which to give it a special relationship with its consort is to bequeath said consort with the pet name “my beloved.” All too eager to press on with its research, however, your Omicron friend immediately sends its pseudo-partner away to self-destruct so that it may measure what possible enhancements have resulted from their bond."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_SEQ_03","At the inquisitive Omicron's request, you collect the forlorn remains of my beloved for analysis. For just a moment, perched at the edge of the universe, you stop to wonder what the hells you are doing with your life."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_SEQ_04","Back at Base Omicron, your largely unruffled partner in crime ponders continuing its work by creating its own “family.” Perhaps someday it will come to truly understand the concepts it is investigating...or perhaps not."

48,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_VERIFICATIONOMNICRON04355_000_000","Assistance requested. This unit has observed a curious phenomenon in which certain members of enemy factions have exhibited a marked increase in their combat capabilities."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_VERIFICATIONOMNICRON04355_000_001","Analysis suggests that said members share unique, intraspecific bonds with others in their faction. These individuals were conferred titles such as “consort” and “family.”"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_VERIFICATIONOMNICRON04355_000_002","This unit detected no difference in physiology that would provide notable advantages in combat, yet the presence of intraspecific bonds alone led to an increase in performance. Records indicate that one member of a bond-group exhibits this exponential improvement when others are eliminated."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZK002_04355_VERIFICATIONOMNICRON04355_000_003","Potential benefits of such augmentation are projected to be immense. Thus, this unit's query─are you familiar with the aforementioned phenomenon?"
