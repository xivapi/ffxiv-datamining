1,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SEQ_01","Alphinaud calls the Scions to a meeting in Dawn's Respite that they might review what they know of the Telophoroi and their ominous towers. Events in Garlemald reinforce their suspicions that the onslaught of lunar primals is only a precursor to a far more deadly crisis─a crisis which must be stopped at any cost. As you ponder your options, Tataru interrupts the gathering to bring word from Krile that you may now journey unto Sharlayan, as well as instructions to make all haste to the docks in Limsa Lominsa."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SEQ_02","After an emotional farewell, you board the ship bound for Sharlayan. At sea you are greeted by a most unexpected visitor, Hydaelyn, who confirms some of what you know, and hints at more that you do not. Her weighty words still echo in your mind as the famous city of scholars appears on the horizon..."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SEQ_03","Your entry into Sharlayan is not as smooth as you had hoped, but the timely arrival of Krile and her convincing arguments is enough to assuage the immigration officer's suspicions. Nevertheless, you deem it wise to move some distance away from the bureaucrat before you discuss the delicate matters at hand."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SEQ_04","Krile expresses relief at your safe arrival, and bids you take a moment to regain your land legs. If you are to embark on a quest for answers, you must mind your step on the treacherous path ahead..."

50,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALPHINAUD_000_002","Let us take stock of the facts, shall we? The crisis at hand began with the sudden appearance of ominous towers in a multitude of locations throughout the world."
51,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALPHINAUD_000_003","We have since learned that said structures were brought into being by an organization known as the “Telophoroi.”"
52,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALPHINAUD_000_004","The Telophoroi's stated purpose is to recreate the Final Days of eons past, an apocalyptic event that would result in the destruction of all we hold dear. Already have these towers of theirs been the cause of untold suffering."

57,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_THANCRED_000_009","Yet while these threats close to home are of paramount concern, we mustn't lose sight of the situation in Garlemald."
58,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_THANCRED_000_010","As you know, the Telophoroi are under the leadership of Fandaniel and one other delightful fellow: Zenos yae Galvus, the crown prince and our dear friend."
59,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_THANCRED_000_011","To date, he's reclaimed his old body, murdered Emperor Varis, and plunged Garlemald into an even deeper pit of chaos."

61,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_URIANGER_000_013","Aye, during our reconnaissance, the air was not once rent by the barking of cannons or the cries of discord. 'Twas an eerie fog of silence which did blanket that ruined city."
62,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_URIANGER_000_014","The inhabitants appeared to have been tempered, and with nary a word spoken did they labor to transform the palace into a soaring edifice born of nightmares."

74,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_TATARU_000_026","Then I'll accompany you to the docks. You need at least one person there to wave and cry and wish you a safe journey!"

76,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALPHINAUD_000_035","Though a part of me looks forward to returning home, I've not forgotten that my father stripped us of the privileges of our family name. I hope it doesn't cause trouble with the officials upon our arrival..."
77,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALISAIE_000_040","What a grim reason to bring you to Sharlayan. Not much to be done about it, I suppose, but I would've liked to give you the grand tour under happier circumstances."
78,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_THANCRED_000_045","Contrary to what you might think, this will be like going home for me as well.

79,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_URIANGER_000_050","I shudder to think what manner of truth awaiteth us beyond the Indigo Deep. Still more do I dread the prospect of discussions long overdue..."
80,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_YSHTOLA_000_055","I might have lived in Master Matoya's cave for a good part of my life, but even for me, the thought of “returning” to Sharlayan is quite exciting. I can hardly imagine how it is for the others who lived most of their lives there."
81,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_GRAHATIA_000_060","I never thought the day would come when I would be sailing home again. It always seemed so very far away..."
82,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ESTINIEN_000_065","Sea travel can be tedious, but I don't mind it. 'Tis a rare experience for most Ishgardians."
83,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_TATARU_000_070","Everyone's here! Which is good, because I've already paid for your passage, and the fee is non-refundable."

85,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SYSTEM_000_080","Continue with the main scenario quest?"
86,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALPHINAUD_000_090","I'm fine. Honestly. Better to be waved through with a stern warning than be denied entry, after all."
87,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALISAIE_000_095","That was about as awkward as expected. Still, we're here now, and that's all that matters!"
88,"TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_THANCRED_000_100","Even allowing that the years I spent in the First passed here in the blink of an eye, the city feels untouched by time..."
