1,"TEXT_HEAVNA408_01995_SEQ_01","Even a penitent can appreciate fine wine, and so Gibrillont would have you deliver a bottle to Gerraldieux, who tends to the poorest of the poor in the Brume. Head below and present Gibrillont's gift to the monk."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA408_01995_SEQ_02","The scent of the twice-mulled wine is enough to bring Gerraldieux's memories of the young mother to the fore, and words unbidden begin to spill from his lips. So filled with love and compassion for her fellow man was she that, despite toiling tirelessly to feed and clothe her daughter, she took time to help Gerraldieux administer succor to the poor. Her loss was keenly felt, most of all by the child she left behind, whom even now the monk can recall passing days atop the walls, her raven black hair flowing in the wind as she stared out into the mists in silence. Leave the monk to his memories and return to the Forgotten Knight."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA408_01995_SEQ_03","“She was a remarkable woman,” Gibrillont says after a time, and when you look into his eyes, you know he speaks the truth. For after all she was forced to endure, she still held fast to hope─if not for herself, then for her beloved daughter."
