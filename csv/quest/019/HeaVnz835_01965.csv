Unfortunately, their quarry has spotted them in return, leaving them beaten and bruised down by the broken bridge. She bids you meet with her there before the bandits finish the job."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ835_01965_SEQ_02","You rendezvous with Midnight Dew and the injured goblins, locked in a stalemate with the leader of the bandits. While she protects her frazzled friends from the outlaw's accomplices, she bids you challenge the head wastrel himself and bring him to justice."

She tells you that it is not unusual to see bandits in the hinterlands─after all, the Sharlayan ruins make perfect hideouts for outlaws on the run from the city–states of Eorzea. However, this is the first time their criminal avarice has posed an existential threat to Idyllshire itself. Midnight Dew thanks you for your assistance in capturing the criminals─now that her stock is returned, trade with the goblins can continue and the survival of Idyllshire is secured."
