1,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_01","Timbermaster Beatin produces a spear shaft found in the North Shroud. Though the head has broken off, he proceeds to identify it as Ishgardian in origin and fawn over its quality. He feels that such a treasure must be returned to its rightful owner, and asks you as a well-traveled adventurer to visit the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly in Ishgard. Make your way there, and find a veteran knight who might be able to tell you to whom the spear once belonged."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_02","You speak with a veteran knight, who informs you that the broken spear is most likely that of a long-dead member of the order. He directs you to this man's son, Barthovieu, known to frequent the Brume."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_03","Barthovieu, a lowly soldier, accepts the broken lance in amazement. He tells you his father was weak, a knight who left to fight Dravanians, but instead died an honorless death at the claws of mere beastkin. Barthovieu now lives in squalor as a struggling single father. For the sake of his son, he means to earn himself knighthood by hunting dragons. However, he needs a bow to do so, and would ask you to make him one after he can scrape together the necessary funds.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Barthovieu upon reaching level 53."

50,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BEATINE_000_002","A member of Gridania's finest brought it to me after discovering it during his patrol. How it ended up in the North Shroud is a mystery, but it is a fine piece of craftsmanship."
51,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BEATINE_000_003","The style is undeniably Ishgardian─though few could tell as much, as the spearhead is missing."
52,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BEATINE_000_004","To a master, however, the love of both carpenter and wielder for this weapon is obvious. The haft has been worn smooth through use, revealing the quilted pattern of the wood."
53,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BEATINE_000_005","It is a king amongst lances. I thanked the Wailer for his help─though it is a great pity he could not find the spearhead. Regardless, it deserves to be returned to he who loved it. I know I would be distraught if I lost such a treasure."

56,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BEATINE_000_008","Thankfully, the lance gives us a clue as to its owner─here, the winged crown of the Temple Knights carved upon the shaft."
57,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BEATINE_000_009","Of course, this only somewhat narrows the field. But a member of their order may be able to help. Judging by the age of the spear, the more veteran the better. In any case, I now leave this in your capable hands."

62,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_KOSAN01997_000_023","Had a son, too. Craven lad, by the name of Barthovieu. Known to hang about the Brume.

66,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BARTHOVIEU_000_032","I was just a boy the last time I saw this. 'Twas the day my father rode off to battle the Horde astride his steed, a fine man of the Temple Knights. Last time I saw him alive, too."
67,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BARTHOVIEU_000_033","We got his body back by and by, mangled though it was to the seven hells. Killed by measly beastkin of all things. Damn milksop."

70,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BARTHOVIEU_000_036","But I'll not fight with the spear. I've no desire to be mauled to death, like my father. The bow's my weapon now. Or it would be, if I had a proper one to hunt dragons."
