1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ834_01964_SEQ_01","Midnight Dew's comrades have sighted an empty skiff moored along the cliffs to the south, and believe it to be the getaway craft of the thieves who stole her stock. She plans to head south of Saint Mocianne's Arboretum to cut off the bandits from their means of escape, and asks you to meet with her there to help her hunt them down."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ834_01964_SEQ_02","You rendezvous with Midnight Dew amid the ruins of the Answering Quarter. With the skiff still empty and no sign of the bandits in the vicinity, she concludes that they must be holed up in the hills. She proposes that you head up into the hills to flush the thieves out while she stands guard against their escape."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ834_01964_SEQ_03","You head up into the hills to find the bandits, but the bandits find you first. A pair of burgling blackguards attempt to ambush you in a narrow pass and you are forced to cut them down. Return to Midnight Dew south of Saint Mocianne's Arboretum to inform her of all that befell."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ834_01964_SEQ_04","Midnight Dew is pleased to hear that you have brought another two bandits to justice, and relieved that it was an able adventurer like you that fell into their trap, and not one of her goblin comrades. With several bandits still on the loose and half her property still in their hands, she asks that you continue to lend her your invaluable assistance to track down the last of the thieves."
