1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ908_01973_SEQ_01","Wait as Mogule might, the moogles from the Twelveswood are nowhere to be seen. He is sure that his directions to meet at the floating island among the sea of clouds were perfectly clear. However, it seems he underestimated the vastness of the landmasses above the skies, and also the clarity of his own directions, and after conferring with you realizes it may be possible the Twelveswood moogles wrongly traveled to the Sea of Clouds. Since <Emphasis>someone</Emphasis> has to stay behind at Moghome should the Twelveswood moogles eventually show up, Mogule bids you go to the Sea of Clouds to look for the missing moogles. Travel to Camp Cloudtop and ask its inhabitants if they know aught of a band of moogles amongst their midst."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ908_01973_SEQ_02","After questioning the inhabitants of Camp Cloudtop, you find out that not many besides you have ever actually seen a moogle in the flesh. However, one of the knights tells you of a man named Gildon, who has been going on about “kupo” related nonsense for the past several days. Seek out Gildon near the Rosehouse and see if he has any information that may guide you in your search."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ908_01973_SEQ_03","Gildon, grateful that someone is actually taking his rants seriously, says that he heard moogle voices near Ok' Zundu. Ask the Vanu Vanu of that tribe if they have seen anything of the fabled creatures."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ908_01973_SEQ_04","After questioning the Vanu Vanu of Ok' Zundu, you learn little of use besides knowledge of the creatures and clouds in the area. However, one of the giant birdlike creatures tells you that a Vanu Vanu by the name of Guna Vanu has said something about whispers flitting amongst the clouds. Speak to Guna Vanu to find out what he knows."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ908_01973_SEQ_05","Upon speaking with Guna Vanu, you find that his brother spoke of hearing unfamiliar voices from under a bridge not far from Ok' Zundu. Could these be the errant moogles? Or a troll? Seek out the bridge to find out."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ908_01973_SEQ_06","You search under the bridge and find a lost Kupli Kuki from the Twelveswood. Apparently the Twelveswood moogles misinterpreted the letter, as Mogule guessed, and came to the Sea of Clouds─an understandable mistake. Luckily, thanks to your diligent search, the Twelveswood moogles can now proceed on their way to Moghome for plenty of fun mingling."
