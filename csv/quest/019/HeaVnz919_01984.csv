1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ919_01984_SEQ_01","The Allagan life support node informs you that atmospheric levels of corpse flower spores are at critically dangerous levels─and rising. Destroy corpse flowers to reduce the release of these apparently dangerous pollutants."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ919_01984_SEQ_02","You extirpate the troublesome corpse flowers. Return to the life support node to confirm that there are no other sources of dangerous atmospheric contaminants."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ919_01984_SEQ_03","With the reduced rate of spore output, the life support system is now able to purify the air faster than it is being polluted. The abnormally high corpse flower population seems to have been caused by an airborne growth stimulation medium released from the ecological synthesis research facility."
