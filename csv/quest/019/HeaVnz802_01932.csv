2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ802_01932_SEQ_02","You find the green adventurer in a slight tizzy. He informs you that the last of the vessels he carried across the settlement had a hole in it, and subsequently he has lost five crabapples. Find these for him now, whilst he repairs the broken urn."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ802_01932_SEQ_04","The adventure-dreaming youth takes the crabapples back, and gives you his thanks. Now, report back to Midnight Dew."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ802_01932_SEQ_05","Midnight Dew is happy to learn that you aided the inhabitants of Idyllshire, even in a small way. She tells you that all this was a test of sorts, to learn what manner of person you are. However, you have allayed any doubts she may have had, and earned yourself a modicum of respect within the settlement."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ802_01932_MIDNIGHTDEW_000_001","See, Idyllshire's made of mismatched odds and ends, and the fastest way to learn about newcomers is to work with 'em. So I'm of the mind you should pitch in a bit."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ802_01932_MIDNIGHTDEW_000_002","Ain't a lot of glory in it, but I've got a green adventurer movin' foodstuffs into our storerooms. Go and see if the lad needs help, eh?"
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ802_01932_MIDNIGHTDEW_000_010","Workin' to keep the settlement afloat is hard work more oft than not, but it's worth it. I'm sure the lad yonder would say the same."

64,"TEXT_HEAVNZ802_01932_MIDNIGHTDEW_000_051","When me and mine first got here, it took us a while to find a rhythm. But afore long, we were the best of friends with the gobbies. Now, we're as dedicated as them to buildin' this place into a proper town."
