1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ830_01960_SEQ_01","Feltsmox is still trying to catch a fish and is still having no luck. This time, she suspects the nearby sun bears are the cause of her troubles. She claims they have been coming down into the river, eating some of the fish and scaring the rest away. She asks you to slay four of these bothersome beasts and collect their meat for her."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ830_01960_SEQ_02","You put the sun bears down and gather thick slices of bear meat from them. Hopefully any of them that are left learn their lesson and stay away from the river. Deliver the meat to Feltsmox."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ830_01960_SEQ_03","Feltsmox thanks you for slaying the bears that have been keeping the fish away. Eager though she is to confirm that the fish have returned─by catching a big fat fish to eat─she is too hungry to wait for a bite, and leaves to eat the sun bear meat you gathered for her."
