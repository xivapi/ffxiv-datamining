2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ708_01912_SEQ_02","You have gathered up the supplies from Ok' Vundu territory, though you cannot at the moment reconcile why they seem to be of Zundu origin. Take them back to Hinu Vali to see what she has to say."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ708_01912_SEQ_03","You have delivered the offerings to Hinu Vali, and she explains to you that they were traditionally given to the Vundu tribe to ensure safety for the Zundu. However, the Vundu sometimes do not acknowledge these offerings and attack anyway. Given that the offerings are essentially meaningless, they would be most useful if they were returned to the stores of Ok' Zundu."
