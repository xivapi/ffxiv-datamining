2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ809_01939_SEQ_02","After combing through the Makers' Quarter, you find Drydox's cumbersome sacks. When you look inside, however, all you see is junk. Return these so-called treasures to the goblin in Idyllshire."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ809_01939_SEQ_03","Drydox is very happy to have her sacks back. It transpires that they are filled with artifacts left by the Sharlayans before their exodus, items that can find new use in Idyllshire. It seems thus that you have done your good deed for the day, and contributed to the small settlement's future."
