1,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_SEQ_01","Thanks to the Domans' watchful eyes, you have picked up Eline Roaille's trail once again. Rejoin Ilberd at Sweetbloom Pier in the East Shroud."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_SEQ_02","With some help from Garlond Ironworks, the Alliance has managed to install communications-jamming devices around the city-states, ensuring that Eline Roaille will have no choice but to communicate with her accomplices in person. All that remains is to catch her in the act. Make for the Hawthorne Hut with Ilberd and Yugiri to pursue your quarry."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_SEQ_03","You arrive at the Hawthorne Hut to find that Eline Roaille has already departed for the Bramble Patch. Rendezvous with Yugiri ahead of what promises to be the dramatic conclusion of your hunt."
4,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_SEQ_04","With the Domans' aid, you have apprehended Eline Roaille in the act of meeting her imperial contact. Her guilt is now surely beyond dispute. Speak with Yugiri to hear her thoughts on the mission."

52,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_YUGIRI_000_011","Your quarry makes for the Hawthorne Hut."
53,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_YUGIRI_000_012","If Roaille is truly the one we seek, we can expect that she means to make contact with her Garlean masters there."
54,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_013","An explanation is in order. You are no doubt aware that the Garleans have their own method of communicating over great distances."
55,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_014","Well, our ingenious friends at Garlond Ironworks have provided us with devices which disrupt these communications, and we have installed them around the city–states. In so doing, we have made it difficult for imperial agents to correspond with their masters."
56,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_015","Roaille would thus have no choice but to rendezvous with her imperial contact directly. Yet, as a well-known face in the Immortal Flames, she cannot move about Thanalan without being recognized. It would only be a matter of time before someone saw through her disguise."
57,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_016","'Tis for this reason, I believe, that she has chosen the Black Shroud for her clandestine meeting. <If(Equal(PlayerParameter(71),2))>This place is home to many of your kind<Else/>The Elezen are a common sight here</If>, and <If(Equal(PlayerParameter(71),2))>the arrival of one more Elezen is<Else/>her comings and goings are</If> not like to turn any heads."
58,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_YUGIRI_000_017","As my scouts tell it, the Garleans have sent agents with a mind to destroy the devices and render such direct contact unnecessary. Fortunately, our shinobi have thus far been successful in rebuffing their efforts."
59,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_100_018","...This is it. We need only make for Hawthorne's Hut and catch Roaille in the act."

63,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_032","To convict someone of her standing, we will require damning evidence against her. What could be better than to catch her in the act when she meets with her Garlean masters?"

65,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_YUGIRI_000_050","Even a warrior of Roaille's renown could not have hoped to escape by force. Despite her claims, her surrender does not bespeak innocence, but an awareness that her position is untenable."
