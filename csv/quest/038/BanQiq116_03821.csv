49,"TEXT_BANQIQ116_03821_QHOTERLPASOL_000_001","Could I be awfully impertinent and ask you to bring me some rock salt? Sprinkling it on the meat beforehand draws out the rich, gamey flavors!"
50,"TEXT_BANQIQ116_03821_QHOTERLPASOL_000_002","Could I be awfully impertinent and ask you to bring me some tree bark? Naturally, only the most splendid will suffice."
