1,"TEXT_BANQIQ041_03804_SEQ_01","Convinced of the merits of Qitarl Natl's argument, you express your support for his theory that the Qitari drove the catfish people from the forest, thus bringing about their subsequent extinction. Grudgingly agreeing that his father may have a point, the Qitari youngling Chaqurl Qhotl agrees to assist in the restoration of the third stela.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
