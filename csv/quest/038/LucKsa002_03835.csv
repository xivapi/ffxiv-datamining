1,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_01","You agree to lend your strength to the Bozjan Resistance, and Marsak wastes no time in preparing a ship to ferry you to their base of operations. He bids you meet him at the Doman Enclave when you are ready to embark."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_02","You find Marsak waiting for you patiently at the dock. Prepared to depart, you speak with the ferryman who ushers the two of you onto his airship."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_03","No sooner do you arrive at the Resistance camp than you find yourself face-to-face with Bajsaljen, leader of the Bozjan Resistance. He and his comrades explain to you their plan─to reforge the legendary weapons of Gunnhildr's Blades. Despite the scarcity of recordings relating to Queen Gunnhildr and her guard, they have made great strides in reproducing their vaunted arms. The key to their completion is a holy inscription engraved upon them, any traces of which were lost when Bozja Citadel fell many years ago. For their plans to move forward, they have enlisted the aid of an old friend─Mikoto."
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_04","In perhaps a few too many words, and a demonstration assisted by Gerolt, Mikoto expounds further on their plans. Borrowing the long-forgotten techniques of Bozjan seers, you must use a special crystal focus to enter the memories of those who may have seen the holy inscription required to reforge Gunnhildr's weapons. The problem, however, is that anyone who had glimpsed the inscription perished when Bozja Citadel was destroyed. Or so they thought. While contemplating the possibility of survivors, Mikoto is struck by a vision of the future. In it, she sees Cid Garlond, convincing her that he is the eyewitness you are searching for."
5,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_05","While strangely reluctant, Bajsaljen understands that Cid Garlond is likely your only hope of forging Gunnhildr's weapons. And so he bids you go to Rhalgr's Reach and speak with the Ironworks engineers there to find him."
6,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_06","Speaking with a fledgling engineer in Rhalgr's Reach, it seems as though Cid is too preoccupied to help. Thankfully, Jessie happens to overhear your conversation and clears up any misconceptions regarding his present commitments. Before taking her leave, Jessie asks that you proceed with caution, fearful of what horrors may be unearthed from Cid's past."
7,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_07","Arrangements have been made for Cid to meet you at the Doman Enclave. As you make your way to meet him, you cannot help but wonder what secrets his memories may hold."

277,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_200","During the Third Astral Era, Queen Gunnhildr united the fragmented tribes of the Hrothgar to rise up and drove off the Allagans, eventually going on to found the nation of Bozja."
278,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_201","It should be noted that Gunnhildr was not her name, but rather a title bestowed to the current monarch of any given age. The common thread connecting all rulers of Bozja is their ability to read the stars. There were others who shared in this ability, but they were said to be the greatest seers of their respective ages."
279,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_202","They were also said to be great warriors. When doing battle with the Allagans or any other would-be invaders, the queen could always be found commanding from the front lines."
280,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_203","Alas, Bozja would fall in the wake of the Fourth Umbral Calamity. By some miracle, some few survived and were able to build what we knew as the city-state of Bozja."
281,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_300","They were the elite guard of the queen, masters of myriad arms and magicks, said to be the greatest warriors of their age."
282,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_301","Their combat prowess was matched only by their devotion to Queen Gunnhildr. They would not hesitate to give their lives in her service. And, should one of these warriors fall in battle, their holy blade would be passed on to a suitable successor."
283,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_302","Over time, their title as Gunnhildr's Blades would become synonymous with the gunblade, which gained great renown during the war against the Allagans."
284,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_303","There is not a Bozjan alive who does not know the tales of their heroism. I have no doubt reforging these weapons will lend us both the strength and resolve we need to succeed."
285,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_400","With Master Gerolt's help, we have nearly all that is required to reforge the weapons of Queen Gunnhildr's guard."
286,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_401","While it is true the legends of their might are duly inspiring, to simply call them the blades of Gunnhildr would do little to differentiate these new armaments from the weapons of eld. After all, we do not wish to give the impression that the originals have been recovered."
287,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_402","After much thought, Master Gerolt offered a simple and surprisingly satisfactory suggestion of “Resistance weapons.”"
288,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_403","He also went on to make a rather curious remark about the steps to be taken in their forging: that these weapons can be enhanced further in accordance with the enemies one faces."
289,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MEESIYA_400_404","By the sounds of it, these weapons are never truly complete until their purpose is fulfilled."

305,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_200","Scant though they are, the records we have uncovered thus far suggest the practices of seers date back as far as the Fourth Astral Era."
306,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_201","The region was plagued with all manner of natural disasters in those days, inciting great unrest not only amongst the Bozjans, but neighboring nations as well."
307,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_202","It was during these tumultuous times seers first appeared. In fact, I have reason to believe they possessed the Echo."
308,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_203","Using a crystal focus, they were able to delve into the minds of the downcast and the heartsick, seeking out their darkest memories and altering them to ease the peoples' burdens."
309,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_204","Perhaps they saw the altering of minds as a necessity for their survival, but we must consider the ethical implications of such methods in this day and age. I have no doubt my betters in Sharlayan would consider it to be reprehensible."
310,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_300","My initial analysis of the crystals suggests they are man-made. Nothing in my data can prove the materials are unique to this region, which leads me to believe the Bozjans─or rather, the seers─created them."
311,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_301","However, given the intricate lattices found in these crystals, it seems highly improbable that the Bozjans could have produced them, considering the methods available to them in the Fourth Astral Era."
312,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_302","In fact, on closer inspection, it became clear that its structure is quite similar to that found in Allagan constructs."
313,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_303","Which then begs the question: who were the seers, and whence did they come? This is but a working theory, but I suspect their roots can be traced back to the Allagans themselves─perhaps survivors of the Fourth Umbral Calamity who wished to atone for the sins of their forebears."
314,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_304","They came to these lands seeking a means to help the Bozjans, and in doing so created these crystal foci."
315,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_305","...Ahem. As I said, 'tis but a working theory. Though I understand if it sounds more like a flight of fancy."
316,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_400","Perhaps I should start with a simple explanation, as I did before. Let us consider the composition of a person's aether, shall we? There is corporeal aether of the flesh, incorporeal aether of the soul, and the aetherial residue of an individual's memories."
317,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_401","Were one to be possessed of only corporeal aether, they would be but a walking corpse. Conversely, entities comprised of only incorporeal aether are referred to in layman's terms as ghosts. Of course, a ghost that possesses residual memories could likely recall its past and retain self-awareness."
318,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_402","Using a crystal focus, we can isolate the aetherial signature of memories, much in the same way the seers did. We can then delve into and explore specific memories conjured by the subject."
319,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_403","We must be careful of what we observe, however, for while the information stored in a person's memories can be quite comprehensive, it is not always true to fact. They can be distorted due to the passage of time, or even when first committed to the mind as a result of personal bias."
320,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_404","That is why it is important to mark the distinction between explicit and implicit memories."
321,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_405","Explicit memories are those consciously stored and recalled, while implicit memories are more passively accumulated by our subconscious."
322,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_406","When meeting someone for the first time, their appearance will be kept as part of our explicit memory, though this may fade with the passing of time. Should a great deal of time pass without meeting, however, such recollection can prove difficult."
323,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_407","Yet in that moment, your mind also takes record of everything experienced by your sensory nervous system."
324,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_408","Unfortunately, information called from explicit memory is quite sensitive to misrepresentations of events. After all, if an individual is actively choosing to recall an event, who is to say they will not make alterations to better suit their liking?"
325,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_409","That is why we seek information from implicit memory, which is more likely to be preserved free of the bias of an individual's worldview."
