1,"TEXT_XXAUSE119_03878_SEQ_01","Minfilia's father, Warburton, was a Garlean spy whose true loyalties lay with the Ala Mhigan Resistance. Before his untimely death some fifteen years ago, he stole a wealth of imperial research on the primals, and compiled the findings in his private journal. Though this journal has served to guide Minfilia ever since, she has resolved─after no small amount of soul-searching─to entrust it to Urianger, in the hope that he may succeed in unraveling its remaining mysteries. Present Warburton's journal to Urianger on Minfilia's behalf."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE119_03878_SEQ_02","By curious coincidence, Minfilia contacts you via linkpearl immediately after you deliver the journal to Urianger. She has departed for Revenant's Toll, and bids you follow as soon as you are able. Travel to Mor Dhona and speak with Tataru to gain entrance to the Rising Stones."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSE119_03878_SEQ_03","Tataru welcomes you to Revenant's Toll and the Scions' new headquarters, and explains that Minfilia awaits you inside. Join her and see how you might be of aid to your companions as they settle into their new home."
4,"TEXT_XXAUSE119_03878_SEQ_04","Even as the Scions of the Seventh Dawn celebrate the inauguration of their new headquarters, Urianger arrives unannounced, bearing troubling news. The distant yet dependable Students of Baldesion are no longer responding to his messages. Fearing the worst, Minfilia bids Urianger do everything he can to determine the cause of their uncharacteristic silence. For the time being, however, the Scions have no choice but to continue their work without the aid of one of their closest allies."

51,"TEXT_XXAUSE119_03878_MINFILIA_000_002","As far as the Empire knew, he was their spy. He maintained the deception for nigh on half a decade, furnishing the Resistance with vital imperial secrets while feeding his paymasters subtly conceived misinformation."
