1,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_01","During a recent audit, it was discovered that the crystal stores of Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern have been covertly pillaged. Fearing that the culprits may have ties to the Amalj'aa, the Scions have agreed to assist in the investigation. Proceed to Horizon in western Thanalan and report to Y'shtola."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_02","You find Y'shtola preoccupied and unwilling to converse at length. Speak to Fufulupa, the Brass Blade leading the investigation, to learn more about the thefts."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_03","Fufulupa relays to you news about a carriage that broke through one of their checkpoints and bolted off down to eastern Thanalan, where they were taken into custody by the Brass Blades. He is all but convinced that the thieves have been apprehended and the crystals recovered, until your conversation is interrupted by Thancred, who reveals that the fugitives were no more than common somnus smugglers. Regroup with your friends at Horizon to review the current state of affairs and assess your options."
4,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_04","According to Thancred, there is nothing to suggest that the Amalj'aa have come into possession of significant quantities of crystals. As he communicates his findings to Urianger via linkpearl, you cannot help but wonder who is behind the crystal thefts, and what their designs might be."

50,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_MINFILIA_000_001","It would appear their storehouse in Horizon has been the target of a series of covert robberies."

52,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_MINFILIA_000_003","Significant quantities of crystals─and only crystals─were missing."

54,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_MINFILIA_000_005","The Brass Blades charged with investigating the thefts believe that someone within the Concern is selling the crystals for profit. Alas, they have as yet been unable to identify a likely suspect, and the Concern's proprietors have grown frustrated by their lack of progress."
55,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_MINFILIA_000_006","Needless to say, I would not have agreed to intervene had the stolen goods been of merely monetary value. If there is even a possibility that the thief acts not out of self-interest but in service to a primal, we can ill afford to wait for the Blades to realize their mistake."

61,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_YSHTOLA_000_011","I have already spoken at length with the Brass Blades of the Rose─albeit to little avail. It would seem that the thieves took great pains to conceal their activities."

66,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_FUFULUPA_000_023","The cart bolted off toward eastern Thanalan, where─thank the gods─I hear that our colleagues were able to apprehend them without further incident."
67,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_YSHTOLA_000_024","...A speeding carriage? That would seem a curious choice for thieves of such proven cunning. Yet the Amalj'aa do have a foothold in eastern Thanalan. Hmmm."

72,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_THANCRED_000_029","I figured you had everything under control here, so I just took a brief excursion to the east to check up on our Amalj'aa friends."

74,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_THANCRED_000_031","In all my years, I have never seen such a prodigious quantity of somnus. The Blades were calling it one of the greatest hauls they've ever seen. The stolen crystals, on the other hand, were nowhere to be found."
75,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_FUFULUPA_000_032","Is that so? Alas...I suppose we have no choice but to resume our search elsewhere."
76,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_THANCRED_000_033","We should reassess our options as well. Come with us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."

78,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_THANCRED_000_050","Against all expectation, it would seem the Amalj'aa are innocent of this particular spate of crimes. By all indications, they have yet to replenish the stores of crystals exhausted during their last attempt to summon Ifrit."
79,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_THANCRED_000_051","What I can't fathom is why anyone <Emphasis>else</Emphasis> would go to such lengths to obtain crystals─and in such quantities."
80,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_THANCRED_000_052","It cannot be that we are dealing with simple thieves. If their motive were profit, why would they limit their trade to crystals alone...? Plainly, we are missing something."
