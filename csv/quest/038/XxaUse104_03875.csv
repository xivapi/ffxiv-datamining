1,"TEXT_XXAUSE104_03875_SEQ_01","After five long years, the time has come for F'lhaminn to reunite with her daughter Minfilia. You resolve to accompany the songstress to Vesper Bay and watch over what should prove to be an emotional reunion."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE104_03875_SEQ_02","Upon seeing Alphinaud escort F'lhaminn into the solar, Minfilia rushes forward to embrace her long-lost mother, overjoyed to learn that reports of her death were indeed exaggerated. During their tearful reunion, Minfilia explains that her father was once a member of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, and that following his death in a tragic accident, F'lhaminn raised her as her own. After praising Minfilia for her victories over the Empire, F'lhaminn states that the Scions must leave Ul'dah behind if they are to continue their work. Agreeing at last to Alphinaud's proposal, a reinvigorated Minfilia declares that the order will quit Vesper Bay and establish a new headquarters in Revenant's Toll."
