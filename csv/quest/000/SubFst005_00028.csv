55,"TEXT_SUBFST005_00028_GALFRID_000_13","The power of the elementals wanes, and the harmony of the forest gives way to chaos. A great abundance of life has been lost as the strong run rampant, stifling the weak and new-sprung."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST005_00028_GALFRID_000_14","Though it may not appear so to the eyes of an outsider, the Twelveswood is ailing─its once rich variety a fading memory."
57,"TEXT_SUBFST005_00028_GALFRID_000_15","For the citizens of Gridania, the restoration of the forest is a sacred duty. And it is my hope that adventurers such as you will offer to aid them in their struggle."
