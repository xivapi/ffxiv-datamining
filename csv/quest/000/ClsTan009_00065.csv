1,"TEXT_CLSTAN009_00065_SEQ_01","The guildmaster has a crisis on her hands, as three leatherworkers have abruptly left their posts without completing their commissions. You are to take up the slack by crafting three raptorskin pieces of the highest quality─a pair of fingerless gloves, a targe, and a choker─and presenting them to Geva."
2,"TEXT_CLSTAN009_00065_SEQ_02","Your raptorskin creations have passed Geva's strict inspection. Deliver the fingerless gloves to Pimoh Nelhah at Nophica's Altar, the targe to Leuric at the Carline Canopy, and the choker to Nhago Jawantal at the Shaded Bower."
3,"TEXT_CLSTAN009_00065_SEQ_03","To varying degrees, all three clients were satisfied with the quality of the goods you furnished. Geva at the Leatherworkers' Guild will want to hear of your success."
4,"TEXT_CLSTAN009_00065_SEQ_04","While pleased with your efforts, these recent troubles have convinced Geva to forgo this year's exhibition in favor of devoting the guild's limited resources to filling the commissions of its valued clients.

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Geva upon reaching level 50."

73,"TEXT_CLSTAN009_00065_NHAGOJAWANTAL_000_054","I mean, bah! A choker is a choker. My battle-scarred papa could fashion the likes of this with his one remaining arm tied firmly behind his back."
