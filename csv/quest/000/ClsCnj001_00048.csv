Though a tremendously gifted healer, Sylphie has no interest in learning about nature, an attitude which troubles her elders to no end. Committing your latest lesson to memory, you continue your quest to master conjury.

※The next conjurer quest will be available from E–Sumi–Yan upon reaching level 10."

49,"TEXT_CLSCNJ001_00048_ESUMIYAN_000_2","I am glad. It is the wellspring of all our power. Yet the energy of creation is not one thing but many, and to call upon all without first knowing each is conjury at its most basic."

85,"TEXT_CLSCNJ001_00048_ESUMIYAN_000_75","Alas, her gifts appear to have blinded her to the need for study, and she outright <Emphasis>refuses</Emphasis> to learn about the natural world. She knows nothing of the elements of earth and wind, and is quite incapable of conjuring even the tiniest pebble or the faintest breeze."
86,"TEXT_CLSCNJ001_00048_ESUMIYAN_000_76","I have tried upon numerous occasions to explain to her that conjurers who are ignorant of the source of their power pose a risk to themselves and others, but all to no avail."

The progress you have made does you great credit, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Though you are yet new to the art of conjury, you are no stranger to nature's embrace.
