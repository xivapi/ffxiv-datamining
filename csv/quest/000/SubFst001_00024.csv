55,"TEXT_SUBFST001_00024_PARNELL_000_12","Hardly a matter that warrants a letter, much less the hiring of a courier! Why could she not ask the question in person? <sigh> I sense that adventurers from beyond our borders find Gridanians somewhat difficult to deal with."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST001_00024_PARNELL_000_13","Are we truly so devoid of warmth? If we mistrust outsiders, it is only because so many of them have brought chaos to the Twelveswood─and such sins as theirs are not soon forgotten. Yet...I suppose we <Emphasis>might</Emphasis> endeavor to be a little less...cold."
