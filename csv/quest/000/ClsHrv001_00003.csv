52,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_LEONCEAULT_000_5","Our guildmaster's knowledge of nature is second to none. One need only witness her uncanny knack for spotting the finest timber to see that hers is a truly gods-given talent. It is for this reason that she holds the title of first botanist. Oh, but you need not be overawed, for she is the kindliest of souls!"
53,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_LEONCEAULT_000_6","You will find the guildmaster just outside this building. Seek her out and impress upon her your desire to become a botanist."

56,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_FUFUCHA_000_12","All Gridanians may rightly claim to share a close relationship with nature, but none is so intimate as that of the botanist. It is our calling to nurture the natural environment to the mutual benefit of man and wood."
57,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_FUFUCHA_000_13","But even as nature holds us in her loving embrace, providing for our every need, she is at heart an unsentimental creature. One that will take life just as readily as she gives it."
58,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_FUFUCHA_000_14","Being a botanist means coming face-to-face with this uncomfortable truth on a regular basis. Knowing this, do you still wish to walk our path?"

63,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_FUFUCHA_000_16","Mayhap you will one day feel compelled to dedicate your life to botany. It has been the way with many a weary warrior before you. Till that day comes, I wish you well in all your endeavors."
64,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_FUFUCHA_000_17","The look in your eye bespeaks the passion in your heart. Very well, I bid you welcome to the Botanists' Guild."
