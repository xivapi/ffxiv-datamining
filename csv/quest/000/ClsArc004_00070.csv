6,"TEXT_CLSARC004_00070_SEQ_06","Clearly nettled by the thought of the poachers helping themselves to his prized mead, Buscarron takes great pleasure in the tale of their comeuppance. With the situation under control, you can now return to the Archers' Guild and report all that transpired to Luciane."
7,"TEXT_CLSARC004_00070_SEQ_07","At the Archers' Guild, Luciane praises you for your outstanding service at Buscarron's Scar.

※The next archer quest will be available from Luciane upon reaching level 25."
