2,"TEXT_SUBCTS108_00096_SEQ_02","You learn that to speak with Seserukka is to hear from Popokkuli, and to speak with Popokkuli is to have an earful from Seserukka. What they demand is a rescue mission, but there is nothing simple about entering the Sunken Temple of Qarn─especially after some raiders have set off the ancient traps within. Still, the scholar Nenekko must be rescued, or her brothers will have your hide. Bibimu will allow you entry into the temple once you arrive in southern Thanalan."

They have loving hearts, all three, though in the twins it comes cloaked in much bluster. Nenekko's plan to sow superstitious fear should protect the ruins─and her team─from further danger created by unscrupulous raiders. What time has devoured, knowledge can recreate. And what was lost, soft eyes can find. "
