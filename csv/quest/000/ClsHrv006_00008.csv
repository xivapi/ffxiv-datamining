1,"TEXT_CLSHRV006_00008_SEQ_01","As Gridania continues along the path to recovery, so too does trade flourish with her neighbors. Her premise thus established, Fufucha tells you that an order has arrived from Ul'dah for no fewer than two thousand sprigs of chamomile. The herb is known to grow around Oakwood in upper La Noscea. Harvest fifteen sprigs by way of your contribution to the group effort, and deliver them to Sandre."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV006_00008_SEQ_02","You deliver the chamomile to Sandre, who is bemused by the notion that Ul'dahns could have any appreciation for the herb. Trade may flourish between nations, but it would seem that old prejudices die hard.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 30."

...I jest, of course! A task of this scale will require more than two hands. If you would be so good as to procure, say, fifteen sprigs, I would consider it an appropriate contribution."
51,"TEXT_CLSHRV006_00008_FUFUCHA_000_4","Chamomile is well known for its fragrant aroma and soothing properties. There is satisfaction to be had in ensuring that folk from every corner of the realm can sample the delights of this great staple, do you not agree?"

55,"TEXT_CLSHRV006_00008_SANDRE_000_12","<sniff> Ahhh, that distinct aroma! There's nothing like chamomile tea to calm the nerves. It's the perfect way to end the day, I reckon."

57,"TEXT_CLSHRV006_00008_SANDRE_000_14","I don't know if Fufucha mentioned, but this batch is bound for Ul'dah. It would seem the lords and ladies there have developed a taste for chamomile tea."
58,"TEXT_CLSHRV006_00008_SANDRE_000_15","Developed a taste, I said, but like as not they drink it just to impress their neighbors. Wouldn't surprise me one bit if each cup was served on a golden saucer."
