0,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_SEQ_00","Recent developments have given Alphinaud much to consider."
1,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_SEQ_01","Given the decidedly unfortunate timing of Iceheart's most recent attack, Alphinaud cannot help but wonder if the gods themselves are conspiring against him. Yet even if they were, he would not hesitate to defy them. Follow him and speak with Lord Haurchefant to learn more of the heretics' activities."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_SEQ_02","The route taken by the caravan was known only to a few, yet by all accounts, the ambush laid by the heretics was executed flawlessly─a fact which does not escape Aymeric's subordinate. In spite of this, Alphinaud believes that a thorough examination of the ambush site must be conducted before pursuing other avenues of inquiry. Travel to Boulder Downs and question the House Fortemps knights keeping watch there."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_SEQ_03","One of the knights investigating the scene shares his thoughts with you regarding the attack, speculating that the heretics came prepared with their own wagons to transport the crates. He also makes mention of a squire who survived the attack, who is currently receiving care at the Observatorium. With luck, he will have regained consciousness by the time you arrive."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_SEQ_04","The wounded squire's words paint a grim picture indeed. Disguised as pilgrims, Iceheart and her brethren slaughtered the caravan's guards, and the young man only survived by feigning his own death. As he lay still in the snow, he heard the heretics speak of “Shiva's resurrection”─the thought of which fills the squire with disbelief and dread in equal measure. Alphinaud must know what the squire saw."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_SEQ_05","Apostate to the Holy See, patron saint to the heretics, Shiva lay down with dragons long ago. But she is long dead, and the dead are forever lost to us...are they not? The heretics seem convinced that her resurrection is nigh, but Alphinaud believes it to be something far worse: the summoning of yet another primal, made possible with the crystals stolen from the caravan. If he is right, Iceheart's plan cannot be allowed to come to fruition."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_HAURCHEFANT_000_012","Iceheart's heretics fell upon the caravan bound for Revenant's Toll as it was passing through Boulder Downs."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_HAURCHEFANT_000_013","'Twas an ambush─swift and ruthless. In an instant, every knight was slain, every crate seized. Then, as quickly as they had appeared, they were gone."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_LUCIA_000_014","(-Taciturn Temple Knight-)'Twould be an impossible feat without knowledge of the route─knowledge to which only a select few are privy, I presume."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_ALPHINAUD_000_015","...Quite. We can pursue that avenue of inquiry in due course. It seems to me that examining the scene of the ambush should be our first concern."

64,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_YAELLE_100_030","How brazen these heretics have become, to raid caravans escorted by knights of House Fortemps!"
65,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_FORTEMPSGUARD00057_000_040","Move along, adventurer. There's nothing for─ Eh? Lord Haurchefant bid you speak with us? Then you must be─ Beg your pardon, Scion."
66,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_FORTEMPSGUARD00057_000_041","As you can see, they left nary a crate behind. Tipped the wagon for good measure even."
67,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_FORTEMPSGUARD00057_000_042","Whole thing's a bit odd, if you ask me. Would've been easier to just steal it─though a damn sight harder to conceal it, I'll allow."
68,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_FORTEMPSGUARD00057_000_043","Reckon they came prepared, probably with wagons of their own hidden a way off... Ah, but pay no heed to my ramblings. Absent of proof, 'tis naught but speculation."
69,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_FORTEMPSGUARD00057_000_044","Might be as the squire receiving care at the Observatorium could tell you something more factual. That is, if he's awake. Unlike myself, he was there during the attack─not that his presence amounted to much."

75,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_INJUREDSENTRY00057_000_052","Slowly she approached, her silver hair flowing in the wind like melting snow. Just a young girl, I thought, some poor lost lamb in search of salvation."
76,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_INJUREDSENTRY00057_000_053","Our leader must have thought the same─else why would he let her draw so close? They exchanged some words I couldn't hear, and she leaned forward as if to kiss his cheek...and then he sighed and crumpled to the ground. I didn't know what had happened till I saw the snow turn red."
77,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_INJUREDSENTRY00057_000_054","And then there was red everywhere I looked. I tried to fight, but took a blow to the head, and by the time I came to, the others were dead and the heretics were unloading the wagon. I couldn't... I-I mean, they'd have killed me, so... So I just lay still and listened."

80,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_ALPHINAUD_000_070","Ah, you've returned. What news have you for us?"

88,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_HAURCHEFANT_000_078","Ah...if I recall correctly, the Diamond Forge had requested a rather large quantity of crystals─"
89,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_ALPHINAUD_000_079","Do you not see? Iceheart and her followers intend to <Emphasis>summon</Emphasis> Shiva, as a beast tribe would a primal! Why else would they go to such lengths to secure crystals?"
90,"TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_LUCIA_000_080","(-Taciturn Temple Knight-)...I shall inform the lord commander at once. Lord Haurchefant, you would agree that discretion is of paramount concern?"
