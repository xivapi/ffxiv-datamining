My fellow guildmates invited me to join them in the slaying of a family of peistes who were stealing chocobo eggs from Bentbranch Meadows."

53,"TEXT_SUBFST121_00060_RIBALD_000_04","There was no way I could win, so I simply froze and waited for the end. But that's when I remembered that I was not alone. My friends rallied around me, and together we defeated the peistes! That, my friend, is what a guildhest is truly about."
54,"TEXT_SUBFST121_00060_RIBALD_000_05","What say you, friend? Care to experience a hest for yourself?"
