4,"TEXT_CLSCNJ003_00092_SEQ_04","Your arrival at Josselin's Spire coincides with that of the latest group of soldiers wounded in the battle with the antelope stags. Cast the Cure spell on one of the injured combatants outside Josselin's Spire."

9,"TEXT_CLSCNJ003_00092_SEQ_09","Brother E–Sumi explains that Sylphie's powers of healing draw not upon the boundless energies of nature, but upon her own limited life force. Should she continue to practice her magic, the young conjurer is in danger of sharing her mother's tragic fate. Deeply concerned, the Padjal pledges to search for a way to save the girl, and hopes you will aid him should a solution be found. Returning to the subject of your education, the guildmaster expresses his satisfaction with your mastery of conjury's fundamental principles, and bids you strive to attune yourself ever more closely to the elements.

※The next conjurer quest will be available from E–Sumi–Yan upon reaching level 20."
