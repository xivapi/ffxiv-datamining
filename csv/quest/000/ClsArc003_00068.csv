1,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SEQ_01","You have been instructed to train under Silvairre, one of the most experienced archers in the guild. Speak with the Elezen and learn what he requires of you. "
2,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SEQ_02","Curt as ever, Silvairre declares that the ability to read and anticipate enemy movements is essential to the art of archery. He then orders you to seek out and destroy targets hidden in the East Shroud─a region rife with savage beasts. If you are to complete this task, you will need to observe the behavior of the local fauna, and identify opportunities to pass by unnoticed. Only then will you be close enough to take aim at your targets."
3,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SEQ_03","You have successfully destroyed all of the targets. Report back to Silvairre at the Archers' Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SEQ_04","Your feat does little to earn you Silvairre's acceptance. He next tasks you with slaying Nezul Cattlan the Violator, the leader of an Ixali scouting party. Journey to the North Shroud, slip past the scouts, and slay their leader."
5,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SEQ_05","You have succeeded in slaying Nezul Cattlan the Violator, prompting his scouts to flee Gridania in disarray. Report back to Silvairre at the Archers' Guild."
6,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SEQ_06","Though Silvairre is quick to attribute your success to luck, he grudgingly agrees to stop agitating for your expulsion from the guild. Inform Luciane that you have completed your lesson."
7,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SEQ_07","Luciane is well pleased with your showing against the Ixal, and observes that while Silvairre may refuse to acknowledge your skill, his actions send a different message. Having completed the lessons of your superiors, Luciane pronounces you an archer in your own right, and teaches you the Repelling Shot technique to commemorate the occasion. Thus encouraged, you resume your quest for greater mastery of the bow.

※The next archer quest will be available from Luciane upon reaching level 20."

53,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SILVAIRRE_000_12","And how could you? Archery is the proud tradition of the Wildwood Elezen. The essence of this art─to read one's enemy─has been instilled in us over <Emphasis>centuries</Emphasis>. In that time, we have defended this great nation against every imaginable foe, granting us insight which you will never possess."
54,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SILVAIRRE_000_13","Can you recognize the subtle signs that betray a coming action? No. Can you accurately predict an opponent's movement?

55,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SILVAIRRE_000_14","It is only out of respect for Luciane that I have agreed to teach you."
56,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SILVAIRRE_000_15","Go to the East Shroud and seek out the targets hidden there. But do not presume this will be as easy as before."
57,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SILVAIRRE_000_16","As I told you, the ability to read one's enemies is fundamental to archery. Yet the trials set by my colleagues did not require you to do this."
58,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SILVAIRRE_000_17","Mine will. The targets you seek have been hidden─and I do mean <Emphasis>hidden</Emphasis>─in the midst of a region rife with savage beasts. They will play the part of your enemies."
59,"TEXT_CLSARC003_00068_SILVAIRRE_000_18","In the unlikely event that you spy a target, your limited range will necessitate that you slip past its bestial guardians prior to taking aim─a feat I consider beyond you.
