1,"TEXT_CLSTAN008_00064_SEQ_01","A client has requested that his commission be filled by the guildmaster herself. Disinclined to indulge this request, Guildmaster Geva has instead delegated the task to you. Craft a pair of boarskin smithy's gloves to the best of your ability and present it to Geva for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSTAN008_00064_SEQ_02","Guildmaster Geva assures you that her client will be unable to distinguish the gloves you have crafted from ones of her own making. Take her at her word and deliver the gloves to the blacksmith waiting outside Fen–Yll Fineries."
3,"TEXT_CLSTAN008_00064_SEQ_03","The blacksmith praises your craftsmanship, proclaiming the gloves you fashioned are the finest he has ever owned. Report your success to Geva at the Leatherworkers' Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSTAN008_00064_SEQ_04","The patterns which bear Geva's name were developed years ago in response to a rash of counterfeiting. Realizing that she could not prevent others from copying her creations, Geva swore a vow that the next line of Geva toadskin bags would be made with an eye towards economy, and that the patterns used would enable inexperienced leatherworkers to reproduce her designs with minimal waste. However, as an artisan worthy of the Fen–Yll name, you do not need to rely upon her patterns. Filled with pride in seeing you uphold the guild's high standards, she encourages you to continue your efforts.

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Geva upon reaching level 45."
