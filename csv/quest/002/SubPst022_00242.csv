2,"TEXT_SUBPST022_00242_SEQ_02","Cocobuki tears open the sealed epistle and reveals the subject of the Blades' suspicions: Prelate Yayake, the guild's receptionist. It would seem Yayake's name has been mentioned in connection with that of her former guildmaster, Mumuepo, whom the Blades believe to have fomented unrest in Ul'dah. The disgraced thaumaturge is currently remanded in the Coliseum, where he is forced to fight until his debt to society is repaid. Recalling the way Yayake once idolized the man, Cocobuki is eager to investigate the prelate's recent activities, and asks for your assistance. By way of a first step, speak with Yayake herself, and check for any signs of suspicious activity."

Confident in the probity of her actions, she permits you to return to Cocobuki, and report all."
4,"TEXT_SUBPST022_00242_SEQ_04","Cocobuki mulls over the possible motives behind Yayake's decision to interfere in guild recruitment, but cannot come to any definite conclusion.

6,"TEXT_SUBPST022_00242_SEQ_06","The ominous news that Yayake has removed several volumes from the guild's library leaves Cocobuki profoundly perturbed.

Every title bore special significance to Master Mumuepo, and the fact that the copies taken lack the extravagant ornamentation that became his obsession would seem to imply that they hold some practical value to him. But what could he be plotting? In desperation, Cocobuki decides to set a trap for Yayake in a bid to make her talk. He would have you conceal yourself before the rear entrance to the Coliseum, and ambush the parlous prelate as she steals away to meet her conspirator-in-chief."

Racked with guilt over her inability to prevent her master's fall from grace, she has been secretly working towards his rehabilitation, and preventing others from following in his footsteps. Cocobuki accepts the sincerity of the prelate's words, and encourages her to put her expiatory intentions to work in service to the guild. Her lapses redeemed, Yayake vows to put the past behind her, and to return to her thaumaturgical studies with her head held high."
