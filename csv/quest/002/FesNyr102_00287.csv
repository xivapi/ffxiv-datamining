His assistants in the three city–states have instructions to reward any adventurer who supports their cause with a colored kabuto. Once you have earned all three kabuto, return to the Aftcastle, and present them to the bugyo.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

But the merry maid of Limsa Lominsa─now revealed as the hitsuji ometsuke in disguise─stands in the way of his drastic design. He attempts to use the lamb's power to put her─and you─to sleep, but the lamb rebels and blasts the bugyo instead. You escape unscathed, but the lamb is not so lucky. Activating her own magic without the proper preparation has exhausted her life force, and left her on the brink of oblivion. Reenergize the lamb with a /cheer of encouragement."

His heart heavy with regret, the bugyo entrusts the lamb to you, while he sets about righting the wrongs he has caused. Though the lamb may no longer be able to use the hypnoturgical blast, the friendship that has blossomed between you shall surely bring peace to your heart in the years to come."
