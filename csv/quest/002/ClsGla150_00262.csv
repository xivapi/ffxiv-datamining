5,"TEXT_CLSGLA150_00262_SEQ_05","Your conversation with Aldis is interrupted when a gang of sellswords bursts into the Quicksand, intent on slaying the man. In an impressive display of swordsmanship, Aldis slays most of the assassins, though you do your part as well. His mood soured, Aldis wanders off in search of a quieter tavern. Return to the guild and speak with Mylla."
6,"TEXT_CLSGLA150_00262_SEQ_06","Finally recovered from the shock of Aldis's earlier intrusion, Mylla recalls that she wished to teach you something new. She hopes that your new Shield Lob technique, with which you can attack enemies at range, will serve you well in the future.

※The next gladiator quest will be available from Mylla upon reaching level 20."
