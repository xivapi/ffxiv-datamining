1,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_SEQ_01","According to Jalzahn, your relic weapon is presently not benefiting fully from the soul energy it holds. The problem, he posits, lies in the unattuned state of that energy to its host. Having struck a wall in his search for a solution, Jalzahn bids you recruit the assistance of the ill-tempered weaponsmith Gerolt."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_SEQ_02","Owing to your quick thinking, Gerolt has reluctantly agreed to lend his expertise to your cause. Deliver the good tidings to Jalzahn."
3,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_SEQ_03","In an unlikely alliance, Jalzahn and Gerolt have devised the means by which your weapon may be further enhanced. It seems that, by rendering the relic aethertight by way of a special glaze, you will be able to attune its soul energy through normal use. Speak with Jalzahn when you are ready to begin the process."
4,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_SEQ_04","Jalzahn has entrusted you the care of Gerolt's Zodiac glass. Present to him the relic you wish enhanced, and he will coat it in soulglaze.

※Should you misplace the Zodiac glass, you may obtain a new one by speaking with Drake at Hyrstmill."

53,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_JALZAHN_000_005","You see, though soul energy permeates your weapon, at present, that energy is not attuned to its host. As such, much of it remains latent and untapped."

77,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_075","Aye, I reckon I do. Ye need to <Emphasis>isolate</Emphasis> the energy inside yer relic from external influence."
78,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_076","Ye see, soul energy naturally becomes attuned to its host through use. Problem is, bein' composed of aether, that energy's fickle as sin─gets easily distracted by forces outside the host."

80,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_078","Anyroad, once yer weapon's aethertight, ye just need to use it as usual─run around an' kill things with it.

83,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_081","Ye know them Archons from Sharlayan? They use newfangled goggles what allow the wearer to see traces of aether. We can make somethin' similar, I reckon."
84,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_082","Mind ye, we don't need nothin' near as sophisticated. A magnifyin' glass fitted with lenses what're crafted from aether-sensitive material ought to serve our needs."
85,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_JALZAHN_000_083","Ah, yes! By blending finely ground crystals with glass, it should be possible to create such lenses as you describe. A truly inspired idea! You are a genius, Master Gerolt!"
