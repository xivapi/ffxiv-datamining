※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW101_00236_SEQ_01","It is All Saints' Wake, and the Continental Circus is in town to help the citizens celebrate. According to Godriquelain, however, the members of this traveling troupe are in fact fiends in disguise. He asks that you answer the troupe's call for volunteers, that you may get close to its members and determine whether they pose a threat. If you would oblige him, speak with the uncanny illusionist at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, and offer her your services.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW101_00236_SEQ_02","In excited tones, the uncanny illusionist informs you of her troupe's mission to see that everyone has a frighteningly good time during All Saints' Wake. Using her arts to bestow upon you a frightening form, she bids you terrorize people in Old Gridania.

※If the illusion wears off, you may receive it again by speaking with the uncanny illusionist."

Having regained her composure, she bids you assist with the festivities over in Limsa Lominsa, but not before muttering some rather unsettling things. Return to Godriquelain and report all that you have learned."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW101_00236_SEQ_05","Godriquelain believes that the Continental Circus may be attempting to usher in the legendary Night of Devilry, when creatures of darkness descend upon the realm. The investigation will next take you to Limsa Lominsa; make your way there, and seek out Godriquelain at the Aftcastle."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW101_00236_SEQ_06","You arrive at the Aftcastle to find Godriquelain waiting and eager to pick up where you left off."
