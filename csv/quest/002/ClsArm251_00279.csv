1,"TEXT_CLSARM251_00279_SEQ_01","After inquiring as to what Blanstyr said during your recent dealings, H'naanza launches an impassioned defense of her approach to the education of novices, citing you as a prime example of its efficacy. She then informs you that her old rival has submitted an order for an ingot of the purest steel, forged by none other than your good self. It would appear that the veteran armorer is eager to recruit you to his cause. Craft a high-quality steel ingot and deliver it to him."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM251_00279_SEQ_02","Upon taking receipt of your steel ingot, Blanstyr declares that he is less than impressed with H'naanza's handling of your obvious talent, and encourages you to “do something about it.” What he means by this is unclear, but what <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> clear is that you have become the unwitting subject of your superiors' godsforsaken feud.

※The next armorer quest will be available from H'naanza upon reaching level 30."
