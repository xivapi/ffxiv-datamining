1,"TEXT_JOBNIN451_00233_SEQ_01","Oboro teaches you four new mudra combinations that you can form with your newfound knowledge, but sadly lacks the time to explain, let alone demonstrate the precise nature of their effects and how they will serve you in battle. The task at hand is to see to Tsubame's safety. Return to the dock storehouse where Oboro awaits!"
2,"TEXT_JOBNIN451_00233_SEQ_02","You return to the docks to see signs that a battle was fought in your absence. Tsubame is missing, but Oboro suspects she is close by. Find her and attend to her wounds if she is injured as Oboro fears."
3,"TEXT_JOBNIN451_00233_SEQ_03","As suspected, you find Tsubame in the clutches of Karasu, who while flogging her to near death, has seemingly seen fit to spare her life. Oboro utterly loses control of his emotions, turning against his foe in a blind, frenzied rage, which seems to please Karasu all the more. Suggesting that this is what he had hoped to see in his rival, the traitor agrees to a battle to the death─a battle in which Oboro and you prove victorious. Oboro is about to claim Karasu's life when your flamboyant foe spins a curious tale that suggests the true traitor of Doma was none other than the trusted teacher of the two shinobi, Master Gekkai. Oboro scoffs, dismissing Karasu's words as pathetic lies, but his expression betrays a heart in turmoil. Karasu cryptically reveals the name of a single location─Candlekeep Quay─before taking to the air and self-immolating in a burst of glory as his rival stands there nonplussed. Speak with Oboro and see how he has handled this unexpected turn of events."
4,"TEXT_JOBNIN451_00233_SEQ_04","Understandably rattled by all that has transpired, a stupefied Oboro can only haltingly suggest that the two of you return to the storehouse with Tsubame."
5,"TEXT_JOBNIN451_00233_SEQ_05","While Oboro is reluctant to accept Karasu's words as truth, it appears that his rival's words have planted a seed of doubt in his mind. Give your teacher time to work through his crisis of confidence as you hone your ninjutsu skills to new heights.

※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 50."
