50,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_3","But let us see about your first task... Ah, yes. To help you grasp the basics of botany, I would like you to gather ten pots' worth of latex."
51,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_4","The forest yields to us many and more resources. It is the botanist's job to know what can be found, and where."
52,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_5","If it is latex you require, you would do well to search just outside the Blue Badger Gate or the Yellow Serpent Gate."
53,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_6","Seek out the mature trees that stand in those areas, and then put your hatchet to use. I wish you well."

56,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_SYSTEM_000_9","To locate mature trees, make your way out of the city and then use the botanist action known as <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Triangulate<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>."

58,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_11","Ah, yes. Precisely ten pots of latex, just as I instructed. You have done well."
59,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_12","Latex is easy to find and equally easy to harvest. As such, collecting the stuff is an ideal task for young botanists who are learning their way around a hatchet."
60,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_13","Yet know that being able to swing said tool does not make you a botanist. You must also possess the knowledge to locate the resources you seek."
61,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_14","That will be all from me for the present. I urge you to keep honing your senses and skills as a botanist. Gather near and far, and learn from your experiences."
