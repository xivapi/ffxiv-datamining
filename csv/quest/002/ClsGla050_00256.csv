1,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_01","A gladiator must be capable of commanding an opponent's attention at will. To help you better understand this concept, Mylla has bid you seek out Lominsan marauders harassing people outside the Quicksand. Once located, tell them to face /me and show them that their disruptive behavior will not be tolerated."
2,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_02","The mere sight of you sends the marauders packing. Enter the Quicksand and deal with any belligerents that remain."
3,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_03","Your attempt to intimidate Pfarmurl the Driven nearly ends in disaster until a man named Aldis intervenes, causing the marauder to flee in terror. Speak with Momodi and inform her that all the Lominsans are gone."
4,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_04","Momodi is grateful for the help you and Aldis provided. However, before you depart, she asks that you not speak of Aldis to Mylla. Return to the Gladiators' Guild and tell the guildmaster that the task is complete."
5,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_05","Mylla informs you that the Lominsan marauders have begun terrorizing merchants outside Scorpion Crossing in western Thanalan. Speak with any victim you can find so that you may track down Pfarmurl's gang and bring them to justice."
6,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_06","The Bloody Marauders may be the ones behind a recent assault on a traveling merchant. Search for the merchant's goods outside Scorpion Crossing and confront the Lominsans if they are still in the area."
7,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_07","You recover the merchant's goods and ensure that the Bloody Marauders will terrorize the people of Thanalan no more. Return the stolen goods to their rightful owner."
8,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_08","The merchant is overjoyed to receive his stolen merchandise. Return to the guild and report to Mylla."
9,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_09","Mylla is pleased to hear of your accomplishments. She reminds you that by mastering the sword, you master yourself. Duly advised, you return to your training.

※The next gladiator quest will be available from Mylla upon reaching level 10."

49,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_MYLLA_000_2","As gladiators, we are trained to engage enemies at close range, weathering their attacks as we deliver our own. However, there are times when we must do battle alongside allies whose talents are not the same as our own."

54,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_MYLLA_000_7","Men like these prey on the weak, but will turn tail and flee at the first sign of defiance. You need not resort to violence─it will suffice to show them that you are not afraid of them, and will not tolerate their behavior."
