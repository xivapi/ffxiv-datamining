6,"TEXT_CLSGLA250_00264_SEQ_06","Your private conversation with Aldis is once again interrupted, this time by Zana Lyehga, Leavold's loyal minion. After you defeat the pugilist in single combat, Aldis explains that the guildmaster needs dependable gladiators like you to stick by her. Now that your meeting is finished, return to the Gladiators' Guild and see if Mylla has news of the Alacran."
7,"TEXT_CLSGLA250_00264_SEQ_07","There have been no new developments regarding the Alacran or Leavold. However, Mylla remains confident that it is only a matter of time before her gladiators catch him. Remembering Aldis's words, you return to your training in preparation for the inevitable confrontation.
