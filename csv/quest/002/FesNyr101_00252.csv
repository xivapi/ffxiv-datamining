※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESNYR101_00252_SEQ_01","The lights are lit in Limsa Lominsa in celebration of the turning of the year, and the changing of the heavenly guard. A delegation from the Far East has set to shore in Eorzea to lead the festivities. But while the townspeople choose their new year's resolutions, the leader of the Easterlings seems singularly lacking in resolve. Speak with the hitsuji bugyo, lest the dark clouds that gather on his brows usher in a year of sorrows.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESNYR101_00252_SEQ_02","The bugyo unburdens himself: he dreams of expanding his pet project─an army of spell-slinging sheep known as the Fleece Force─into Eorzea, but his calls have fallen on deaf ears. Convinced that an Eorzean adventurer would have better luck, he recruits you to the Force's propaganda arm. But an immediate problem stalls your progress─the prototype tender lamb refuses to acknowledge your existence. Perhaps a taste of the special fodder the bugyo has ordered through Engerrand, a trader in Hawkers' Alley, might help to win her over."
3,"TEXT_FESNYR101_00252_SEQ_03","Engerrand hands over the nutritious fodder. Return to the Aftcastle, and entice the tender lamb with the platter of toothsome twigs."
4,"TEXT_FESNYR101_00252_SEQ_04","The lamb is delighted with the shoots and leaves, and acknowledges you as its master. Satisfied, the hitsuji bugyo presents you with a ceremonial helm to consecrate your alliance with the Fleece Force. By wearing this kabuto, his underlings across the land will recognize you as a fellow sheepwielder. And so it falls to you to travel to the three city–states, and spread the fame of the Fleece Force to every corner of the realm."
