1,"TEXT_JOBNIN450_00232_SEQ_01","Oboro believes that you have proven yourself worthy of inheriting his people's traditional garb, and has thusly ordered a full set to be delivered from his village. As such a shipment would arouse suspicion at the docks, he has arranged for the goods to be delivered to the De Nevelle Checkpoint in middle La Noscea."
2,"TEXT_JOBNIN450_00232_SEQ_02","That which awaited you at the checkpoint was not the delivery you sought, but a surprise attack at the hands of a suspicious porter, who you subsequently dispatched. Speak with the shadowy porter cowering beside his compatriot's limp body in hopes of finding out just what manner of skullduggery is going on here."
3,"TEXT_JOBNIN450_00232_SEQ_03","Your questioning of the shadowy porter reaches an abrupt end when none other than Karasu appears to silence the tongues of his own men. Karasu claims that the measures he has taken are for your own benefit, as he would see you truly consummate your training before you inherit the garb of the shinobi. To this end, he has entrusted the various pieces to four of his “shadows” that he has deemed expendable. You are to traverse the land and defeat each in single combat to earn what you would claim as yours. Your first challenge awaits at the Red Rooster Stead."

10,"TEXT_JOBNIN450_00232_SEQ_10","You defeat the last of Karasu's underlings, this one disguised as a trader. Open the crate to collect yet one more piece of ninja garb."
11,"TEXT_JOBNIN450_00232_SEQ_11","You obtain the fourth piece of ninja garb, which leaves but one piece remaining to complete the set. Return to the De Nevelle Checkpoint, where Karasu has promised to give you a little something extra."
12,"TEXT_JOBNIN450_00232_SEQ_12","It was not Karasu, but Oboro who greeted you back at the checkpoint, along with a letter stating that the promised surprise will be delivered straight to your doorstep. Oboro fears that this is little more than a thinly veiled threat. Hurry back to the docks and deliver Tsubame from danger!"
