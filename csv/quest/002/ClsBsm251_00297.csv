1,"TEXT_CLSBSM251_00297_SEQ_01","Hoping to win new contracts for the guild, Brithael has asked you to produce another sample. Craft a high-quality steel ingot and deliver it to Faezahr, who will once again handle negotiations."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM251_00297_SEQ_02","Your expertly forged steel serves to elevate you further in Faezahr's esteem, but his opinion of Brithael remains as low as ever. Despite his scorn for the forgemaster, he pledges to recommend the guild's services to prospective clients.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 30."
