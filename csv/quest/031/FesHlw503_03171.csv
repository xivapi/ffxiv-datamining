※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW503_03171_SEQ_01","Upon deliberation, you conclude that the memo mentioned by the mummers should indeed indicate the current location of the pumpkin suspected to be T'maritaa, and that the most expedient way to confirm this is to visit room 201.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

Though she managed to escape unscathed, she was unable to leave the manor due to fear of recapture, and opted to hide instead. With the two reunited and the coast clear, they are finally free to return to the outside world."
