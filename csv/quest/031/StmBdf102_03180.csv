55,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_RESISTANCEGATEGUARD_000_025","So the Garleans make ready to move against us, do they? Well, I would sooner die than wear shackles again...
Commander Hext mentioned you carry a message for Lord Hien. May your road to the Far East be free of imperial curs."
56,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_ALISAIE_000_030","So, Alphinaud is safe─for the present, at least. Now all we need to worry about is a full-scale imperial invasion..."

70,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_000_051","The Kojin and the Confederacy you already know, and it was your own strength of arms that won us the cooperation of the Steppe tribes."
71,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_100_051","We have also been joined by our neighbors from Nagxia, and the indomitable citizens of Dalmasca...though the scattered nature of the latter's resistance will somewhat delay their official induction."
72,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_000_052","These proud peoples have united under a single purpose: to stand against the tyranny of the Garlean Empire."

74,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_000_054","I thank you for bringing me news of Alphinaud. His fate is never far from my thoughts─and not only because he is our emissary. As for this sudden deployment of imperial forces, I agree that Ala Mhigo would be wise to shore up its borders with all haste."
75,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_YUGIRI_000_055","Every report we receive from our shinobi indicates a massing of troops in the western provinces. It seems all but certain that the Empire is poised to bring its fist down upon Eorzea."
76,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_000_056","And I would help deflect that blow. But I cannot risk sending reinforcements just yet. We will remain vulnerable to airborne assault until our wall in the Burn is in place."

78,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_000_058","The...energy barrier, yes. I thought to call it something more auspicious. A name drawn from the Four Lords of legend, perhaps─“Seiryu's Aegis” or some such. Well, just a thought."
79,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_YUGIRI_000_059","The Ironworks engineers report that they have finished calibrating the generators, and are ready to proceed to the testing stage."
80,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_000_060","Have you time to attend the first test? You've seen the field which protected Azys Lla firsthand, and I would be interested to hear how you think ours compares."
81,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_ALISAIE_000_062","I will come too, if you don't mind. Though I am no Y'shtola, I may be able to offer some insight."
82,"TEXT_STMBDF102_03180_HIEN_000_063","Of course. Time being of the essence, it would be best if we made directly for the Burn. Yugiri, I leave you and Hakuro to bring the war council to a close."

Your mounts are saddled and ready, my lord. Ware the storms."
