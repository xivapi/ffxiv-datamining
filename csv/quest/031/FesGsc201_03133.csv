※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESGSC201_03133_SEQ_01","Still trembling from her brush with the paranormal, a dismayed maiden tells you the Gold Saucer is now host to spirits from beyond. Fearing such a disturbance could force the establishment to close down, she pleads with you to seek out Godbert Manderville, owner of the Gold Saucer, and lend him your aid to deal with this otherworldly threat.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESGSC201_03133_SEQ_02","Godbert offers you a warm welcome, but quickly takes note of your grave expression. He wastes no time in telling you what he knows of the apparitions that have taken residence in the Saucer. Though he has yet to attain an accurate description of them, his staff claim they were last seen at Event Square. "
3,"TEXT_FESGSC201_03133_SEQ_03","A nearby patron, seemingly down on his luck, tells you of his plan to catch, not ghosts, but faeries he claims are hiding in the Saucer. He claims to have seen them heading in the direction of Wonder Square."

5,"TEXT_FESGSC201_03133_SEQ_05","As you enter Round Square, you see a most unexpected sight. Not ghosts, faeries, or balloons, but moogles. Perhaps now you can ascertain the truth behind the Gold Saucer's troubles."
6,"TEXT_FESGSC201_03133_SEQ_06","The moogles were, in fact, the otherworldly creatures that had both patrons and staff in a panic. Taking a keen interest in cultures other than their own, they could not resist the temptation of a festival at the Gold Saucer. They soon rush off to Entrance Square to apologize for the trouble they have caused."
7,"TEXT_FESGSC201_03133_SEQ_07","You return to Entrance Square, the moogles in tow. Thankfully Godbert is not angry for their presence─far from it. He considers the moogles to be honored guests, and intends to waive away the recent happenings at the Saucer as part of the festival. He then takes his leave to inform the staff of their arrival, so that they may enjoy a day of mirth and merriment."
