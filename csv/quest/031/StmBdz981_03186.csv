1,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_SEQ_01","A merchant who trades in salt from Gyr Abania's famed Saltery left a message for you with Bloezoeng of Revenant's Toll. Simply put, should you have the time to come and see him in Stonesthrow, outside Ul'dah, he asks that you do so."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_SEQ_02","Acot, the salt merchant, is something of a fan of you and yours. He thanks you profusely for your part in facilitating the joint enterprise of the sultana and Lord Lolorito that saw the Saltery restored, for the revitalized industry has led directly to the creation of countless new jobs for Ala Mhigan refugees in Ul'dah. The influx of new wealth has transformed the community and brought prosperity to people outside and inside the walls─and Pearl Lane is no exception."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_SEQ_03","The salt merchant's testimony proves to be no exaggeration, for everywhere you look in Pearl Lane there are hopeful refugees pursuing various means of improving their lot. But will this change be lasting or fleeting? Landebert, a local refugee leader, has doubtless been watching these recent events with skepticism..."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_SEQ_04","Landebert is unsurprisingly unwilling to take this new era of prosperity at face value, for he knows all too well how easily the wealthy elite of Ul'dah can bend the truth. This is why without hesitation he rejected an offer of employment from one of the most prestigious banks in the sultanate. However, to your mutual surprise, Lord Lolorito of the East Aldenard Trading Company decides to make a personal appearance to persuade the refugee leader to work for the financial institution, explaining that people look to him for guidance, and would be more willing to place their faith in the many ventures associated with the Mirage Trust if they saw him do so as well. Seeing an opportunity to aid his countrymen, Landebert agrees to work for the bank, provided that he and his countrymen are afforded various benefits in formal written contracts, and that they are afforded representation to negotiate for additional considerations in the future. After a moment's deliberation, Lolorito agrees─likely believing that any such Ala Mhigan union could be easily subverted if necessary. And perhaps it can and will be...but not without considerable resistance from Landebert and his like-minded comrades."

49,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_BLOEZOENG_000_001","The salt he trades in is Gyr Abanian, you see. Quality stuff from the Lochs, worth every gil, let me tell you!"

51,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_BLOEZOENG_000_003","Goes without saying that the returned refugees have benefited greatly from the arrangement. Not just them, though─seems that there are newfound opportunities to be had for those still in Ul'dah, too!"
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_BLOEZOENG_000_004","By the onion, in my rambling I forgot why I called you over! The message from Acot! Apologies, apologies. He asked that you come and see him in Stonesthrow, should you have the time to spare."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_BLOEZOENG_000_008","I expect Acot wants nothing more than to thank you profusely in person, as is in keeping with the Eorzean tradition."

57,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_ACOT_000_013","But I'm not the only one grateful for your intervention. You see, all the salt exported from the Lochs is brought here first and afterwards shipped to every corner of Eorzea."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_ACOT_000_014","It's a massive new industry that requires a considerable amount of labor. Take a look around and you'll see how much the lives of the refugees here have changed as a result."

73,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_000_042","The selfsame bank holding Teledji's fortune that Lolorito so generously gifted to the House of Ul following the bastard's death. A gesture of reconciliation to smooth over the “tensions” between the Royalists and Monetarists."
74,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_000_043","As if the two were ever truly at odds. The sultanate is content to let Lolorito manage the estate so long as they get their cut."

78,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_000_047","So aye, I told that bank man to piss off. Bloody fool. What in the seven hells was he thinking, coming down here and offering me a job, as if I don't know a poisoned chalice when I see one..."
79,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LOLORITO_000_048","(-???-)Would that everyone were so perceptive..."

85,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LOLORITO_000_051","I will not deny that you have cause to distrust our offer of employment. Under Teledji Adeledji's management, the bank was...less than charitable in its treatment of its staff."
86,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LOLORITO_000_052","Contrary to his public support of the refugee cause, he aggressively pursued cost-cutting measures which led to unconscionably long shifts and drastically reduced wages. Consequently, quality of service was much reduced, as was the reputation of his businesses."
87,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LOLORITO_000_053","He was a shortsighted imbecile─but I am not. Neither the sultana nor I would see his policies perpetuated, and intend to offer rather more equitable terms─increased compensation, periods of rest, and so forth."

Nay, it is about every single venture associated with the Mirage Trust, which your people rightfully regard with caution. If they are to grow and prosper, it will only be with the support of our Ala Mhigan residents."
92,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LOLORITO_000_058","You are a leader in your community, Landebert. A man who commands respect and loyalty when he speaks. If you vouch for us, then others will listen."

95,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_000_061","That was then and this is now, hmm? So sayeth the chairman himself..."
96,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_100_060","But it ain't that simple, is it? You can't promise folks the stars and expect them to take you at your word. I want it in writing─for me and mine both. Contracts, legal and binding."
97,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_100_061","And we want a seat at the table─representation for our collective interests."
98,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LOLORITO_000_062","Ala Mhigans united in common cause, bargaining as one? Interesting... In principle, I have no objection. You shall be joining us at the bank, then?"
99,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_000_063","I reckon he thinks he's got his hooks in me. Well, we'll see about that."
100,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_000_064","Even if he gives us everything we demand, I know he'll try to undermine and divide us. Wouldn't be surprised if he succeeded, too...but at least we'll have a fighting chance."
101,"TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_LANDEBERT_000_065","Aye, we'll play his game...for now. Work our way into positions of power and necessity, so when the time comes to remind him who needs who, we'll be ready to extract some real concessions. Just you wait!"
