Lest you have forgotten, you fetched me purbol flowers. Only after we went our separate ways did it occur to me that I had failed to introduce myself. That oversight, I shall now rectify."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS631_03178_BULUGAN_000_008","I am Bulugan of the Adarkim, and the man I seek, Adkiragh, is my older brother, whom you may recall has gone into hiding. I had come upon rumors of his whereabouts, and thus did I set out to find him and bring him home."

78,"TEXT_SUBCTS631_03178_BULUGAN_000_022","Hail to you, friend. I am a wayfarer come far from the east in search of my lost brother. The proprietor of the Hard Place─know you if he is a Xaela like me, and a native of the Azim Steppe?"
