2,"TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_02","You gather briefly at the lip of the Yawn, and Cid explains the need to run his new device through a final inspection. Alpha seems concerned about Cid's state of mind, and you feel compelled to follow the chocobo back to Rhalgr's Reach to check on the engineer."
3,"TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_03","From the shadows of a pillar, you witness Cid talk through his misgivings with a bemused Nero. After a lengthy and seemingly cathartic exchange, it seems the chief is now ready for what may come..."

Using the control module, you should be able to disable the machine's weaponry with a targeted burst of concentrated lightning.

Unwilling to look a gift wyrm in the mouth, you gladly accept the proffered ride back to the edge of the Yawn.
