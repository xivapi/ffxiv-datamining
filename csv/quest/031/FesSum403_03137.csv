0,"TEXT_FESSUM403_03137_SEQ_00","Haermaga wishes to shower you with praise, while R'fhul Tia prepares to tackle the obstacle course.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM403_03137_SEQ_01","Following your emphatic conquest of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, you return to Haermaga to share the good news. In light of your inspirational display, R'fhul Tia eagerly prepares for his own attempt. R'majha races ahead to find a spot from which the two of you can watch her brother's acrobatics.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM403_03137_SEQ_02","Immediately after setting foot on the starting platform, R'fhul Tia charges forward to make the very first jump. Unfortunately, he possesses all the airborne grace of a sodden sponge and plunges unceremoniously in the water below. Fearing for his safety, R'majha rushes over to check on her crestfallen sibling."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM403_03137_SEQ_03","After dragging himself to shore, R'fhul Tia regains his composure and tries to hide his embarrassment with laughter. His sister takes offense at this and storms off without explaining the reason for her anger. As you and R'fhul Tia continue the conversation without her, she disappears from view entirely. Realizing she is now missing, R'fhul Tia asks you to help search for her."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM403_03137_SEQ_04","You eventually find R'majha on the eastern shore, having covered a surprising distance in such a short time. Her excursion has done nothing to brighten her mood, and she stubbornly refuses to talk to her brother. R'fhul Tia suggests splashing her with water to help ease the tension."
5,"TEXT_FESSUM403_03137_SEQ_05","The splashes of cold sea water do the trick, setting R'majha to giggling and washing away her black mood. She explains her frustration at seeing her brother's jovial reaction to his abysmal performance on the obstacle course. R'fhul Tia has long claimed it his dream to become an adventurer, and as such, his sister expected him to treat the contest more seriously. She also expresses concern about his plans to leave home in search of fame and fortune. R'fhul Tia assures her that although he may be parted from his family, he will not place himself in unnecessary danger and will return safe and well. Once you are satisfied that the matter has been concluded, you return to Haermaga."
6,"TEXT_FESSUM403_03137_SEQ_06","Haermaga is visibly moved to hear that R'fhul Tia decided to become an adventurer after he witnessed the guild's acts of heroism at a previous Moonfire Faire. He thanks you for your various contributions and invites you to enjoy the remainder of the festival."

After all the casualties we've had, I was worried that the guild would accuse us of constructing a death trap! We've had a few minor maimings, true, but no one's died yet. That has to count for something, aye?"
