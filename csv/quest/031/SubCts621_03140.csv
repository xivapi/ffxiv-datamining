97,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_SANANA_000_183","Now, this is just one aspect of the outside world, and you mightn't want the same for Sui–no–Sato. But I daresay this turns your preconceptions on their heads."
98,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_JIKKAN_000_184","Indeed, people of all races and nations appear to be gathered here. And there are countless kinds of wares being offered, many of which I have no name for. It is...eye opening."
99,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_KURENAI_000_185","With its port open to the world, Kugane has been nourished by the free flow of trade to become the rich and prosperous city we see before us."

102,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_JIKKAN_000_188","That being said, I harbor one grave concern. And until said concern is addressed, I cannot offer my support to your endeavor."

104,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_JIKKAN_000_190","Long as we have kept to ourselves, I believe us ill prepared to engage with the outside world."
105,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_JIKKAN_000_191","Were we to open our gates now, we would find ourselves flooded with wares from without. Wares superior to our own, upon which we would grow dependent.

106,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_SANANA_000_192","What? That's it? Well then, you've got nothing to worry about. See, the beauty of trade is that it works both ways."
107,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_SANANA_000_193","All you need is a product of your own. Something unique to Sui–no–Sato, that can compete with anything else out there."
108,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_KURENAI_000_199","'Tis a wonderful idea, I shouldn't doubt, yet I cannot help but worry. For generations we have lived in austerity. What could we possibly offer to the people of the surface, who know every luxury?"

110,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_JIKKAN_000_201","Very well. While you strive to conceive a suitable product, Your Grace, I shall turn a blind eye to your...unofficial activities. Should your efforts prove fruitless, however, you shall abandon your endeavor."
111,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_KURENAI_000_202","Thank you for granting me this opportunity, Lord Jikkan. And thank you also, my friends. I am truly blessed to know you."

116,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_KURENAI_000_241","En route back to Tamamizu, Sanana and I discussed the subject at some length. We believe that a marriage of our two worlds would be ideal─the bounty of the Ruby Sea, worked with the techniques of the surface."
117,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_SANANA_000_242","Aye, we take a treasure of the deep only Kurenai's people have access to, and give it a foreign touch. There's something to gain for everyone. With a concept like that, we're bound to come up with a winning product!"
118,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_SANANA_100_242","We just need to...er, find something to base that product on. If it's to make a mark on the world, it has to be inherently valuable. I'm talking jewelry and the like."
119,"TEXT_SUBCTS621_03140_KURENAI_101_242","Hmmm... These waters yield objects that may suit such a purpose, but I fear they are not of a quality to impress the folk of the surface."
