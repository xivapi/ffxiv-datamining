0,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_SEQ_00","Martyn is eager to take you into the field for further training."
1,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_SEQ_01","Now that you have learned Mind Blast, Martyn deems you ready for the next stage in his impromptu training regime. Once again, Spineless Basin is the chosen location, recalling unwelcome memories of being duped into exterminating a pest to help line Martyn's pockets."
2,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_SEQ_02","This time, the locals have paid Martyn in advance to slay some troublesome moles, a task which he has wasted no time in delegating to you. He insists that this will also prove beneficial in improving your blue magic, since they provide moving targets on which to test your new Mind Blast spell."
3,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_SEQ_03","Despite being outnumbered, your burgeoning blue magic makes short work of the mischievous moles. Now that the pests have been dealt with, you hope that Martyn has something to teach you in exchange for your hard work."
4,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_SEQ_04","You find Martyn being accosted by a gang of thugs, to whom he apparently owes money. Although your instincts as an adventurer compel you to rush to the aid of your mentor, he is adamant that he can handle these ruffians by himself. Rather than using his blue magic to repel his assailants, Martyn attempts to appease them by surrendering his clothes. His plan works better than expected, and the moneylenders decide not to carry out their threats of bodily harm, although the matter of the borrowed coin is far from settled. Not one to be deterred by such setbacks, Martyn heads back to Ul'dah, seemingly paying no heed to the fact that he is almost as naked as the day he was born."
5,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_SEQ_05","Thankfully, Martyn found a spare costume awaiting him on his return, although having to pay for it himself only adds to his woes. The unexpected arrival of Whastrach, an old acquaintance, does nothing to brighten Martyn's mood. The unwelcome visitor's voice drips with disdain as he takes great relish in pointing out that the blue mage has become a shadow of his former self since leaving the Arcanists' Guild. And though Whastrach mercifully chooses not to stay any longer than necessary, it seems that Martyn will be seeing more of his former associate sooner rather than later. At a questioning look from you, your mentor reveals that they once worked as researchers and traveled to the New World to study blue magic. When their funding was cut, Martyn practically bankrupted himself to pursue his passion, while Whastrach chose a more lucrative career as the head of a trading company. Keen not to dwell on the past, Martyn changes the subject to more immediate matters, and sets you the task of learning the Faze spell as the next step to becoming a master of blue magic.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 30 and learning Faze."

52,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_LATOOLJA_000_005","Martyn is wearing mask more and more, even when no one can see him, and when is sleeping. Perhaps Martyn prefers being Great Azuro to being Martyn?"

55,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_012","Why are you lookin' at me like that? Oh, you wanted trainin', didn't you? Erm...in that case, why not try stoppin' them in their tracks with Mind Blast?

71,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_WHASTRACH_000_033","If you must know, I'm here on business─very lucrative business, I might add. And as luck would have it, I heard rumors of the Masked Carnivale, starring a so-called blue mage. It didn't take much to deduce that my old friend Martyn was behind it."
72,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_034","If you're here to watch the show, buy a ticket. If you just came to gloat, save it for another time, because I ain't in the bloody mood."
73,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_WHASTRACH_000_035","I say! It's not like you to be so hostile. Perhaps I should come back when you're feeling a little more amenable. I'll be seeing you, Martyn."
74,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_036","The less I see of that smug prick, the better. You see, we've known each other since our time at the Arcanists' Guild, where we researched magicks from outside of Eorzea."
75,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_037","We both traveled to the New World and spent time with the Whalaqee, who taught us about blue magic. But when we came back to the guild to share our findin's, they said it was “simply not practical” and cut off our fundin'."
76,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_038","The theory was sound, I just needed to spend more time with the Whalaqee, so I paid for another expedition out of my own pocket. Damn near ruined me, though. Now I'm up to my neck in debt, tryin' to make ends meet by performin' like some bloody clown!"
77,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_039","Whastrach, on the other hand, ditched the research when he realized there was no money in it. Even though he went through all the trouble of learnin' blue magic like me, he just lost interest."
78,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_100_039","After that, he came back to Eorzea and set up his own tradin' company. Him and his rich friends started rakin' in the gil, doin' gods only know what."
79,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_040","Sorry, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I expect you've got better things to do than listen to my sob stories. Like learnin' some more spells, for instance!"
80,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_041","The next one I want you to add to your arsenal is “Faze.” It's perfect for givin' you an openin' to land a few more hits. Or run away─whichever you prefer."
81,"TEXT_JOBAOZ200_03195_MARTYN_000_042","Anyway, once you've mastered that one, come and see me. Becomin' a blue mage ain't easy─and I know that better than most─but stick with it, and one day you'll be just like me! Actually, you should probably ignore that last part..."
