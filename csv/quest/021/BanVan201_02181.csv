Fondly recalling the richness of the soil around her former village, she asks you to return to retrieve some sackfuls to be used on Ok' Gundu Nakki, as well as some fire-touched wind crystals to treat the existing soil. "

49,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_MUNAVANU_000_001","Muna offers to help her, but she asks for netherling's assistance instead. Maybe netherling helps sow seeds, too?"
50,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_010","Ranu Vali is glad netherling came. There is lots to do and scarce to work with for preparing village land for tilling. As of this sun, earth of Ok' Gundu Nakki is dry as dhalmel bones, impossible to grow crops."
51,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_011","See here? How it blows away like dust in breeze? Ranu tries sowing and sowing, but soil is not favorable for almonds, or lemons, or even sanuwa relief patch!"
52,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_012","Even so, Ranu still has hope, remembers soil of old village. Very rich for tilling, very reason why ancestors settle on that spot. If netherling brings ancestors' chosen soil to Ok' Gundu Nakki, Ranu is certain that village grows sweetest lemons in Sea of Clouds!"
53,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_013","But chosen soil alone will not bear fruit! Wind crystals of Last Step, those touched by fire are also very important for treating barren soil. Might netherling bring those as well? Ranu is very grateful in advance, like dry plains awaiting approaching rainstorm."
54,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_014","Wind crystals must be able to balance right amount of soil. Three wind crystals good for about three sackfuls of Gundu soil. Ranu Vali is counting on netherling! "
55,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_020","Was netherling able to find ancestral soil and wind crystals? Ranu can feel sowing season drawing near on breeze..."
56,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_021","Yes, ancestors' chosen soil smells exactly as Ranu remembers as nestling! Feels so soft and moist as fresh spring shower!"
57,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_022","Ranu Vali was worried about leaving Ok' Gundu soil far behind. Dry, dusty land of Ok' Gundu Nakki felt foreign under her feet. But thanks to netherling, little piece of former village returns and island will truly feel like Gundu land!"
58,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_023","Now real work begins! Ranu must treat dry Ok' Gundu Nakki soil with wind crystals, then mix fertile earth from old Gundu village into crop patch, so two homes become one. "
59,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_024","Hmmm...it will take a while to sow seeds. Gundu and netherling must wait patiently. But when juicy fruit ready for harvest, taste moves <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> like mountain! "
