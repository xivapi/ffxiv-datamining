1,"TEXT_HEAVNY809_02118_SEQ_01","While passing through Idyllshire you find yourself accosted by a boisterous stranger, who marks you as a notorious adventurer prone to picking fights with gods. Though he claims to admire your “work,” he observes that, because you do not undertake such trials by yourself, it must be difficult to tell if you are pulling your weight. He too has such worries, which is why he has been training in Stone, Sky, Sea─a new training ground of some repute, of which a goodly adventurer outside Idyllshire can tell you more."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY809_02118_SEQ_02","Although he stumbles more than a few times in his explanation, the guide tells you that the new training ground, which was opened by the Adventurers' Guild, offers a variety of striking dummies which are tailored to the strength of certain legendary beings. By defeating these dummies in the allotted time, you can determine whether or not you have the potential to go toe-to-toe with said beings─that is, if you can survive their onslaught, for unlike their real-life counterparts, the dummies do not hit back..."

51,"TEXT_HEAVNY809_02118_ADVENTURER02118_000_003","Don't let the daft name fool you. It's a proper trainin' ground, where fightin' folk like me and you can go to refine our killin' prowess. If you've never been, go and look for the goodly fella out past the Backbridge. He'll tell you the rest. You won't regret it!"

56,"TEXT_HEAVNY809_02118_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_014","Right, so, in essence, we've got these ridiculous contraptions that you attack in whatever manner you deem fit. Each is supposedly tailored to the strength of some legendary beast or being some madman decided to challenge once upon a time."
