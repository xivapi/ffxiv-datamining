※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN110_02180_SEQ_01","The Vanu Vanu are starting to molt, their oldest feathers falling away to make place for fresh new plumage. But the process leaves them looking disheveled and unkempt. This misfortune is easily ameliorated through simple use of a comb─an item the Gundu find themselves distinctly lacking right now. Fortunately, the Zundu are nearby, and are famed for the quality of their combs. Muna Vanu asks that you obtain some for his tribe, but notes that the Zundu will not part with their craftsmanship for free. He suggests you kill wamouracampae and gather their meat for trade. Start by collecting wet straw to draw these cautious creatures from their nests. It can be found some way south of Ok' Gundu Nakki.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest. "
2,"TEXT_BANVAN110_02180_SEQ_02","You find the wet straw where Muna Vanu said it would be. Burn it at a wamoura nest, found near the Blue Window, to draw your prey from its hiding place so that you may slay it and gather its meat."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN110_02180_SEQ_03","You make short work of the wamouracampae and quickly butcher the flesh from their abdomens. Take your prize to Guna Vanu to trade for the combs the Gundu need."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN110_02180_SEQ_04","When you show him the wamouracampa meat, Guna Vanu is more than happy to give you as many combs as you need in exchange for it. Deliver these combs back to Muna Vanu before his tribe starts molting in earnest."
5,"TEXT_BANVAN110_02180_SEQ_05","Muna Vanu thanks you profusely on behalf of the whole Gundu tribe. Without proper combing, the feathers the Vanu Vanu shed will remain hidden within their plumage for days, causing discomfort and itching, and making them look altogether much more scruffy than is respectable. As such, regular combing is a part of life for them─all the more so during molting season."
