※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN107_02177_SEQ_01","Muna Vanu informs you that it is currently laying season for the anzu of Abalathia. Their eggs will make a wonderful supplement to the ever-dwindling stockpiles of food that the Gundu keep. Travel to the Nidifice, where these beasts make their nests, and collect three anzu eggs for him.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANVAN107_02177_SEQ_03","Muna Vanu is glad to have the succulent eggs you gathered, but even happier that you braved the fearsome anzu for the sake of his people. Only the most fearless Gundu warriors brave these terrifying monsters. That you would do so too puts your allegiance to the Gundu beyond doubt."
