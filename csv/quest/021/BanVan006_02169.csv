Sonu Vanu is willing to fight, but it seems his people are hesitant to join a battle they have little chance of winning. After some terse words and arguments, Linu Vali suggests that if the two tribes cannot win by virtue of numbers, then they should rob the Vundu of their will to fight with the sundrop dance. The plan is met with some agreement, but the Zundu's fighting spirit is not what it once was. They need a mighty warrior to show them the sundrop dance and rekindle the flames of fury in their heart. All present agree that you, as the one who defeated Bismarck, should be the one to motivate the Zundu with the sundrop dance. Linu Vali will teach you the steps, but first you must perform the initiation ceremony. Meet Linu Vali at the entrance to Ok' Zundu to begin the ceremony."
