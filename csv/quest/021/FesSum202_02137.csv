1,"TEXT_FESSUM202_02137_SEQ_01","J'nangho tells you that the Red Ranger has been busy honing his ability to extinguish fires on smoldering dummies. Believing a bit of friendly competition is just what he needs to speed his training along, she tells you to follow him on an elbst and attempt to put out the dummies' flames before he can.
