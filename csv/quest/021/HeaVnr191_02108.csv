Make your way along the shores of the Thaliak and discuss your recollections of the event with Redbrix."

Though you are generally loath to look back, it is not impossible that stepping into the past may be of benefit to you in the future.

To think of a marvel so strange or so tall,♪
A steely skinned giant whose veins coursed with steam,♪
In whose bright burnished bosom foul goblins did scheme,♪
A heaven to they who therein did dwell,♪
But one whose mere being made all else a hell.♪"

So into his huge hand a hero did stride,♪
And battled through legions to reach his hard heart,♪
Conspiring at last to rend it apart.♪
His core being no more, the giant fell still,♪
Though the goblins remained there to plot further ill...♪"
