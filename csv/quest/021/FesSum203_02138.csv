※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM203_02138_SEQ_01","It is an unusually hot day in Costa del Sol, and J'nangho is concerned that the Black Ranger will overexert herself if she attempts to complete her regular training regimen. After trying and failing to convince the obstinate Ranger to stay indoors until temperatures drop, she asks that you deliver three cups of rolanberry shaved ice to the lady in black so that she will not succumb to the summer heat.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM203_02138_SEQ_02","You deliver the rolanberry shaved ice to the Black Ranger. Taking the first of the cups, she expresses to you her dislike of ice. Upon explaining to her that it is not for the pleasure of eating but rather to counteract the heat from the sun, she hands the cup back to you, proposing the two of you play a game of hide-and-seek, but with a twist. You will give her a head start of twenty seconds to hide. She will continue performing squats as you search for her and, if you find her before she is able to complete the designated number, you win. Should she finish before you find her, she wins. The loser must then eat the shaved ice as punishment."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM203_02138_SEQ_03","You spy the Black Ranger and see that she has yet to complete her squats. Approaching her, you offer her the first cup of rolanberry shaved ice, once more, and this time she does not hesitate. Taking it from you, she gulps it down before racing off to begin her next round of squats. Find and deliver the second cup of shaved ice to her."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM203_02138_SEQ_04","When you find her, the Black Ranger is only a few squats away from finishing. Sighing with defeat, she extends her hand to receive the rolanberry shaved ice and quickly eats it. Declaring the number of squats she intends to acheive with the next round, she runs off. Locate her and deliver the last cup of shaved ice to the Black Ranger."
5,"TEXT_FESSUM203_02138_SEQ_05","The Black Ranger quickly downs the final cup of soppy rolanberry ice and while clearly disappointed by today's outcome, she seems determined, promising to improve so that she might further aid the Red and Yellow Rangers. Return to Haermaga and inform him of the successes and failures of today's session."
6,"TEXT_FESSUM203_02138_SEQ_06","Haermaga is delighted by your dedication and the progress of his Rangers. He asks that you continue supporting them with the same fervor you have shown today."
