※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN108_02178_SEQ_01","A band of lawless Vundu youths have been carousing in the former Gundu village, and Muna Vanu is loath to overlook so disrespectful a display. Bringing the full force of your power against mere children would be a crime, so the wise Gundu suggests a different approach─to buffet them with humiliating blasts of wind from a sanuwa. Luna Vanu will be able to provide you with a beast suitable for this task.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest. "

※Speak with Luna Vanu in Ok' Gundu Nakki to mount a sanuwa."

Report back to Muna Vanu with news that the situation has been resolved without exacerbating the tense relationship between the Gundu and Vundu tribes."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN108_02178_SEQ_04","Muna Vanu is glad to hear that you were able to dislodge the Vundu without having to resort to violence. Enough blood has already been spilt over the old Gundu village. There is no need for further slaughter."
