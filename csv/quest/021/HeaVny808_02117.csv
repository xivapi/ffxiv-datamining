2,"TEXT_HEAVNY808_02117_SEQ_02","Priorfaix is most impressed with <Highlight>ObjectParameter(55)</Highlight>. As he tells it, the process of training a flightless chocobo to take to the heavens involves providing it with experiences that will rouse the instincts of its wild ancestors that lie dormant within. For the first stage of the training, bring your chocobo to the Chocobo Forest and slay Dravanian bee clouds."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNY808_02117_SEQ_03","You slay Dravanian bee clouds, allowing <Highlight>ObjectParameter(55)</Highlight> to experience the life-and-death battle that his wild brethren face each day. Return to Tailfeather and report your success to Priorfaix."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNY808_02117_SEQ_04","Priorfaix congratulates you on your success. For the next phase of the training, your chocobo must feel the high winds that his flying forebears once knew. The chocobo trainer suggests two locations suitable for the task: one in the northeast part of Tailfeather, and one in the northwest of Falcon's Nest in the Coerthas western highlands. As the heights are too precarious for a flightless bird to reach, the chocobo trainer suggests that you take in the winds alone, then convey them to <Highlight>ObjectParameter(55)</Highlight> by way of scent."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNY808_02117_SEQ_05","You have bathed in the winds of the Dravanian and Coerthan heights, in the hopes that their brisk scent will suffice to awaken your steed's long-forgotten ability of flight. Report your success to Priorfaix."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNY808_02117_SEQ_06","Priorfaix congratulates you on your efforts, and confirms that <Highlight>ObjectParameter(55)</Highlight>'s training is now complete. Read the winds closely, and take to the skies atop your loyal steed!"

Phew! Pardon me for saying so, friend, but you stink. Not an unpleasant stink, mind you. Rather, you stink of chocobo─a distinctive scent for which I must confess a certain fondness."
49,"TEXT_HEAVNY808_02117_ARNOULAIN_000_001","<sniff> <sniff> Not the musky aroma of a wild bird, nor the common scent of a rental chocobo who has carried thousands. No, yours is a stink singular and true─would I be correct to surmise that you are the proud owner of your very own bird?"
