※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN203_02183_SEQ_01","Muna Vanu comments that Eenu Vanu does not seem to be at his best as of late, and wishes you to inquire what is troubling the master of clouds.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANVAN203_02183_SEQ_02","Eenu Vanu explains that his Zundu friend took his advice to try the fishing spots near Neverreap, but ignored his warning about going to the perilous area alone. As his friend has not returned since last sunrise, Eenu Vanu wants you to check the area to confirm his friend's well-being."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN203_02183_SEQ_03","Focusing entirely on the large fish biting at his line, the Zundu cloudfisher brushes off Eenu Vanu's concern and fails to notice a handful of starved paissas approach the cliff, lured by the scent of the fish basket. You slay the beasts before they have a chance to pounce on the preoccupied cloudfisher. Speak to him again to tell him how close he came to losing his day's work."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN203_02183_SEQ_04","The Zundu cloudfisher is surprised by the attack and grateful to you for fending the paissas off, but he still wants to have one more go at the one that got away. Relay to Eenu Vanu that his cloudfisher friend will return to the village shortly."
5,"TEXT_BANVAN203_02183_SEQ_05","You return to Ok' Gundu Nakki to explain what happened to Eenu Vanu, who seems relieved to know his friend is all right and will return soon. As the fishing spot near Neverreap can be an unpredictable place, he vows to go with his friend next time to make sure they have safety in numbers. "
