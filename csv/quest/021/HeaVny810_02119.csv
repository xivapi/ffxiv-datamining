If you think you have what it takes, head to the bar of the Forgotten Knight and ask Ardolain for more information."

As a novice member of Clan Centurio, you are permitted to take level one mark bills from the board and collect their rewards. For more information about the Clan Hunt, or to exchange Centurio Seals for exclusive items, speak with Ardolain in the Forgotten Knight. Otherwise, pick a bill from the board and put the marked monsters to the sword to help bring a modicum of peace to the bloodstained snows of Ishgard."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNY810_02119_AYTIENNE_000_002","You'll have heard of the Hunt, right? The Grand Companies run it in the rest of Eorzea, but up here it's the Clan's concern. We follow the same system, but we're free to pick our own marks."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNY810_02119_AYTIENNE_000_003","Reckon you've got the speed, the strength, and the heart to take down some of the most ferocious fiends this side of the seventh hell?

60,"TEXT_HEAVNY810_02119_ARDOLAIN_000_017","The Clan Hunt board's on the wall outside, at the top of the stairs. Since you're new to the Clan, I'd ask you only to take level one bills for the nonce. Prove you've got what it takes to be a hunter, and I'll think about giving you some bigger fish to fry."
