※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN104_02174_SEQ_01","The Gundu's stockpiles of food grow scarcer by the day, while the Vundu larders swell to bursting with supplies. As his people come to terms with the imminent threat of starvation, he bids you slink into the Vundu camp and steal away with four of their pots of food.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANVAN104_02174_SEQ_03","Ecstatic that his tribe is no longer faced with the grim threat of starvation, Muna Vanu explains the reasons for their lack of food and the Vundu's abundance of it. Now that the Gundu have been forced from the verdant land they once called home, they have nowhere to catch food, while the Vundu hunt and gather at their leisure. With only so much food to go around, and all of it in Vundu larders, the Gundu may have to help themselves to their enemy's supplies for the time being."
