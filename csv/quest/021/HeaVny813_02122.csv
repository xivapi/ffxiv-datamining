1,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_SEQ_01","Ardolain informs you that the leader of Clan Centurio has recommended that you be accepted as a fully fledged hunter, with permission to undertake hunts for elite marks. He bids you return to the Clan Hunt board to examine the elite mark bills posted thereon."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_SEQ_02","You examine the Clan Hunt board and flick through the bills available. For more information about the Clan Hunt, or to exchange Centurio Seals for exclusive items, speak with Ardolain in the Forgotten Knight. Otherwise, you are free to risk life and limb hunting down the most malicious monsters in the frozen north and make a name for yourself as an elite mark hunter."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_100_000","I've had word from Ser Leaudaste, the master of Clan Centurio. Seems he's been keeping half an eye on your progress, and he reckons you're just about ready to spread your wings as a fully fledged elite mark hunter."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_000_001","Ser Leaudaste was born into a noble family, but he left all that behind to head out hunting, tracking down the fiercest foes and destroying them for the good of the realm. Folk call him the original hunter-scholar. Being recognized by a feller like that ain't nothing to be sniffed at."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_000_002","Don't be letting it get to your head, though. These elite marks are on a whole 'nother level to aught you've hunted before, and charging in willy-nilly's a sure way to meet your maker. We give them ranks based on how deadly they are, just like the Grand Companies do."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_000_003","You'll find the bills for these elite marks up on the Clan Hunt board alongside the others. You're free to take whichever bill you choose, but make sure you know what you're doing before you head out hunting. Every one of these beasts is a nightmare incarnate!"
53,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_000_012","Whenever a new elite mark comes in, we'll post the bill up on the Clan Hunt board. It's always a good idea to ask your fellow Clansmen about a mark before you head out hunting─as they say, knowledge is power, and power's what you'll need to get the better of these beasts."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_SYSTEM_100_020","The Clan Hunt board is covered in bills showing the details of wanted monsters. As a fully fledged member of Clan Centurio, elite mark bills are now yours for the taking!"
55,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_SYSTEM_000_010","You are now permitted to take bills for elite Clan marks from the Clan Hunt board."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_SYSTEM_000_011","Defeat rank S, rank A, and some rank B elite marks, and you will be rewarded with Centurio Seals. These seals can be exchanged for exclusive items."
