49,"TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_001","It's a simple enough task. Just take this here pail of mortar, find a couple of spots where the walls are looking ragged, and apply a healthy dab. Thanks, friend─what with our ranks thinned as they are, we need all the help we can get!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_010","Truth be told, the whole fort needs a good patching up after what we've been through. But with supplies and manpower limited as they are, all we can do is focus on the places that need it most."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_020","I saw you hard at work out there, friend! I'll rest easy tonight knowing that some of the ugliest patches of our walls are looking as good as new."

53,"TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_022","Yes, this fort's taken its fair share of beatings, but it stands tall to this day, watching over and protecting the Crystarium and its people. And it's our job to <Emphasis>keep</Emphasis> it standing─material and manpower shortages be damned."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_023","'Course, we couldn't do it without the generous efforts of volunteers like you. I reckon you have a real talent for repairs─mayhap I could interest you in joining the guard as a full-time wall mender?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_024","Ahahaha! I jest, of course. I've already taken enough of your time today. Thank you, friend, and be careful out there."
