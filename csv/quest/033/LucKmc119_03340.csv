1,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_SEQ_01","The Eulmorans have been routed, and while they scramble to regroup, Almet urges you to make for the Qitana Ravel. Together with your fellow Scions, you travel east, following the trail of flowers leading to its entrance."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_SEQ_02","You touch the door to the Qitana Ravel and feel aether emanating from within. The way is indeed open. Beyond awaits Rak'tika Falls and, you hope, the Lightwarden. Gritting your teeth, you cross the threshold, wary of the myriad dangers now stirring to life to bar your passage.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_SEQ_03","After fighting your way past the sentinels of the Qitana Ravel, you arrive at Rak'tika Falls where, as expected, you find the Lightwarden. A frantic battle ensues, but in the end you emerge victorious, and the primordial Light of the firmament at last gives way to a breathtaking night sky. Your task complete, you turn your steps back to Fanow."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_SEQ_04","While passing through the halls of the Qitana Ravel, a series of murals chance to catch Y'shtola's eye. As she ponders their significance, her thoughts are interrupted by the fashionably late arrival of Emet-Selch. He bids you make haste in quitting the temple, but soon finds himself similarly captivated by the murals, not out of curiosity but nostalgia. Y'shtola duly invites him to explain what it is they depict, and he obliges with an utterly unforeseeable tale: that Zodiark and Hydaelyn are the eldest of primals, and that it was the Ascians who first conjured them into being. His lesson concluded, Emet-Selch then departs, leaving you and your companions to continue your journey outside in stunned silence."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_SEQ_05","You have been confronted with an uncomfortable truth─assuming it <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> the truth. Yet there is little time to give thought to Emet-Selch's claims, for your duty to save the First is not yet done."

51,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_RYNE_000_010","Urianger once told me that being immersed in the Lifestream can cause irreparable harm to the body. Do you suppose Y'shtola is all right?"

53,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_URIANGER_000_016","To have done so <Emphasis>twice</Emphasis> beggareth belief. 'Tis plain Y'shtola wanteth not for favor among the Twelve."

56,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_CYMET_000_030","It was fate who brought you to us, and fate who returned your companion to you. She yet smiles on Ronka, I am sure of it."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_035","I told you, I tire of these inane arguments. Shouldn't you be getting ready to slay the next Lightwarden or something?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_ALMET_000_040","With the Eulmorans gone, and your companion now returned, I think it best you go now before they can regroup."

61,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_URIANGER_000_043","Nay. Though we had but little time before the Eulmorans' most unwelcome arrival, we scoured the nearby environs and spoke once more with the one called Korille."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_URIANGER_000_044","Having hearkened to her tale, it is my judgment that the sin eater which her late mother did espy was indeed the being we seek, and that it most likely resided in the vicinity of Rak'tika Falls."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_URIANGER_000_045","In the absence of any subsequent sighting, I have no reason to believe our quarry hath sought out a new sanctuary. And given the considerable difficulty we face in reaching the falls, we may be certain it hath not been disturbed by man."

65,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_YSHTOLA_000_047","We must navigate the Qitana Ravel and make for Rak'tika Falls."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_ALMET_000_048","Though you see it as but another obstacle to be navigated, the Qitana Ravel is the oldest and most sacred of our temples. The accumulated knowledge of the empire is said to reside within."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_ALMET_000_049","Knowledge which is rightly yours as allies of Ronka. You are welcome to explore."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_YSHTOLA_000_050","I fully intend to survey every ilm of it─once our mission is complete."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_UIMET_000_051","Were the emperor still alive, he would be overjoyed to hear you say so."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_UIMET_000_052","But I must warn you─though the way is open, it will still be heavily guarded."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_CYMET_000_053","To discourage trespassers and test the worth of our allies, it had to be so."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_CYMET_000_054","Be careful in there."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_ALMET_000_055","Head east and you will find the path of azure flowers leading to the Ravel. I wish you safe passage through its halls."

76,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_YSHTOLA_000_058","Now, let us away."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_YSHTOLA_000_060","This had better work. I have no wish to return to the Great Pyramid."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_THANCRED_000_065","After you, my friend."

82,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_ALMET_000_085","Travel east along the path of azure flowers. The Qitana Ravel is not far."

84,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_CYMET_000_095","You need not worry about the Eulmorans while you are inside. Should they return, we will be ready."
85,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_100","Lest you doubt, I <Emphasis>won't</Emphasis> be helping you do battle with the Lightwarden. To accompany you thus is quite taxing enough."

87,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
88,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_A1_000_001","Are there any other Ascians here in the First?"
89,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_A1_000_002","Actually, I...don't."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_102","Not a single one. Happily, I am quite content to mingle with the masses. And even if I did crave the company of my own kind, one might say we're understaffed at present."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_103","There are no strict rules governing how we work, though that has not been without its consequences. In the beginning, we were each responsible for a shard, and free to do as we wished, but Igeyorhm's impetuous temperament showed us the folly in that."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_104","In light of her failings, we took to working in tandem as the situation demanded."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_105","Mitron and Loghrif were supposed to take care of the First, of course."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_106","Alas, they were slain by the champions of this realm shortly before the Flood. Expendable though they were, I found them quite useful."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_EMETSELCH_000_107","But that is a tale for another time."

97,"TEXT_LUCKMC119_03340_SYSTEM_000_110","You can feel the aether flowing through the door. A gentle push may be all that's required..."
