51,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_CYMET_000_015","We should have tried harder to repel them."

54,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_ALMET_000_022","But I fear that is of little consequence, for we have tried to mark the depth of the pit. And failed."

56,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_024","Sister! I come bearing news!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_025","The Eulmoran soldiers and the Children have fled Yx'Maja."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_026","They abandoned Slitherbough as well, though they yet remain in the swamps near Lakeland."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_027","Unfortunately, a number of the Blessed were poisoned while fending off the soldiers."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_028","One we believe to be of their order was found lost in Yx'Maja, feverish and badly wounded."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_029","He was taken to Fanow for treatment, but I fear there is little we can do for him."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_030","He and the other Blessed will not last long without an antidote."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_THANCRED_000_031","Then we must act quickly. If you've a spare vial, Minfilia and I can deliver it to the Blessed at Slitherbough."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_THANCRED_000_032","You and Urianger should return to Fanow and tend to the wounded villager there."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_RYNE_100_032","What about Y'shtola...?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_THANCRED_000_033","I know it seems callous of us to leave, but she leapt into that hole for a reason."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_THANCRED_100_033","We have to save the Blessed. Whatever it takes."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_RYNE_110_033","All right."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_ALMET_000_034","My sisters and I will remain here. We must be certain no soldiers are still lurking about."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_URIANGER_000_035","Come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Let not Y'shtola's sacrifice be in vain."

74,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_URIANGER_000_051","'Twas he who forestalled the Eulmorans' procession. And in so doing, afforded thee time to traverse the temple."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_URIANGER_000_052","Quickly, the antidote."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_URIANGER_000_060","Quickly, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I fear he hath precious little time."

79,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_SYSTEM_000_090","The medicine seems to take effect as the color slowly creeps back to his cheeks."
