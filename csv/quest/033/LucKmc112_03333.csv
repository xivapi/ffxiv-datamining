1,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_SEQ_01","Y'shtola rushes off to Slitherbough to inform the others preparations to enter Yx'Maja are complete. Once rested, she bids you join them at the cave that leads out to the east of Slitherbough."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_SEQ_02","With the seal of Ronka in hand, weapons at the ready, you and the Scions set out into Yx'Maja in search of the Ronkan ruins and their protectors."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_SEQ_03","As you wend your way through Yx'Maja, you are suddenly assailed by arrows from the trees. As arrows continue to rain from above, one of three figures jumps down and begins a vicious assault against Y'shtola. It is only after Urianger interrupts the lancer's onslaught that she finds an opportunity to present them with the seal of Ronka. The attack stops almost immediately. The lancer confirms the seal appears to be genuine, but her counterparts towering above in the trees are not yet certain. They invite you to follow the trail of azure flowers to their village. There they will decide if you are friend or foe."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_SEQ_04","Upon closer examination, their leader, Almet, recognizes the authenticity of your seal and welcomes you as allies of Ronka. It appears your arrival is long awaited, but to what end remains yet to be seen."

49,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_YSHTOLA_000_001","I will go ahead to Slitherbough and inform the others. When you have recovered from your exertions, meet with us in the cavern leading east out of the village."

52,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_RYNE_000_015","I'm so glad to see you're safe. Everyone is ready to go if you are."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_URIANGER_000_020","That you all found the seal is perhaps bittersweet proof that the aid for which it was so painstakingly forged never came."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_URIANGER_000_021","Thus did the empire crumble, its ruins reclaimed by the wood. Fate is ever a fickle mistress."

57,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_YSHTOLA_000_032","It did not take long for the wood's protectors to find me when last I came here, and I expect them to fall upon us just as quickly this time."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_YSHTOLA_000_033","Though we carry the seal, that is no reason for us to let down our guard."

62,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_ALMET_000_050","(-Bow-wielding Sentinel-)I would have the seal, that we may confirm its authenticity."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_YSHTOLA_000_051","Straight to the point, I see. Very well."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_ALMET_000_052","(-Bow-wielding Sentinel-)Hmmm. There is no mistaking the crest of the royal family."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_ALMET_000_053","(-Bow-wielding Sentinel-)It is of proper size, and by its weight it is plain it was made from gold. The seal is indeed genuine."

73,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_ALMET_000_061","(-Almet-)You must be tired after your journey. Come, take your ease."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMC112_03333_UIMET_000_062","If you'd like I will show you about the village. Though I must warn you it is a long way down to the forest floor, so do watch your step."
