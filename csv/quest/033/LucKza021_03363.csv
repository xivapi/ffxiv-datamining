51,"TEXT_LUCKZA021_03363_GHINGIN_000_004","Maybe you could do it? Yes, that would work. Do you know the long bridge? Northeast from here, it is."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA021_03363_GHINGIN_000_005","Take this wriggler powder and scatter it on the big rock on this side of the ravine. And maybe a bit more, further up the road."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA021_03363_GHINGIN_000_006","Why, you ask? Simple. We Mord use aromas like this to wake us up when we are sleepy or tired. Once my son smells this, he will have no trouble reaching the Red Serai!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA021_03363_GHINGIN_000_007","Oh, and could you give this letter to Thaymoth?"

61,"TEXT_LUCKZA021_03363_THAYMOTH_000_032","It seems like he's gone out of his way to help his son, though it's probably a bit unnecessary. From what I've seen, he's quite capable of taking care of himself without being mollycoddled."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZA021_03363_THAYMOTH_000_033","Having said that, it's hard not to be moved by this gesture of his. I know that family means a lot to the Mord, more than we give them credit for sometimes. I'll see his son gets fair treatment, don't you worry."
