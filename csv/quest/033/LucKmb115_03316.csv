51,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_003","They refuse to work, instead spending all their time cavorting and making a nuisance of themselves. It was when I was outside for a walk that they set upon me and robbed me of my possessions, the ink included."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_004","I was too weak to resist them...but you, mortal─you look quite strong. Do you think you could take my ink back from those villains?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_005","If you do this, I will consider it your patronage. And by way of my service, I will make you something very special!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_RYNE_000_006","E-Excuse me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but I couldn't help overhearing. If you mean to undertake this task, will you let me accompany you?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_RYNE_000_007","I would learn from you...and help in what little way I can."

62,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_020","The lawless ones make their lair to the south, inside a cave called Father Collard's Chambers. When they see you, they're like to attack on sight, so please take care!"
63,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_RYNE_000_030","Father Collard's Chambers is through here. I peered inside, and sure enough, it was milling with Nu Mou. They looked none too friendly."

66,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDAENC_000_040","Still offering your patronage to us? When you have a moment, I would speak with you all."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_050","M-M-Mercy, Your Majesty! We had no choice! Please forgive us!"
68,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_051","...O-Oh, it's you. M-M-My ink─were you able to retrieve it?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_052","Haha! Yes, this is the ink, and almost all of it too!"
70,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_053","When our king spoke to me, my day went from bad to worse, but thanks to you it's simply bad again!"
71,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_054","What? You had the vision too? Oh, woe is us..."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_055","Ordinarily, when a living being turns into a sin eater, it loses everything about its mind that defined it. However, the king has retained some of their instincts."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_056","This manifests in the desire to play and be free. So strong is that desire, it often leaks through the seal to invade our consciousness."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_057","For a long time we've ignored it, but we can't do so forever..."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_058","But forgive me, I was going to thank you for reuniting me with my ink. You did exactly as I asked, so I will give you the service I promised.
...Ahem! Nothing up my sleeve, and...voilà! May it serve you well!"
