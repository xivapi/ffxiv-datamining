They're scattered along the sands, but I don't know that I'll find them all before the waves steal them out to sea."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZA007_03349_FISHERMAN03349_000_022","We made this rod ourselves, me and him... I lost count of the number of times we slipped away to go fishing instead of grubbing about in the fields."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA007_03349_FISHERMAN03349_000_023","So he should've known better than to try crossing those choppy waters in that tiny boat. I told him─wicked white, how many times I told him─and then the Divide swallowed him up and spat him out. The damned fool..."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA007_03349_FISHERMAN03349_000_024","I suppose I'd better bury these bits and pieces with him, and then get back to work. Thank you for your kindness, stranger."
