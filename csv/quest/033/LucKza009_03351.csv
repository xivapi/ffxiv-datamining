You there, have you seen a timid mouse of a man cowerin' in a corner somewhere?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_001","I'm talkin' about my husband─clumsy, overcautious clod that he is."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_002","All I asked was for him to bring some shellfish back for dinner, and he's been gone for bloody hours!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_003","I hate to inflict my troubles on a stranger, but if you're headed down to the beach and spot my good-for-nothin' husband, tell him to get a move on with the main course!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_004","If you find yourself down on the sands for whatever reason, please keep an eye out for my missin' husband. Just look for the bloke what's shakin' at his own shadow."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERMAN03351_000_010","Wh-Who are you? Wh-What do you want with me?"

55,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERMAN03351_000_012","<sigh> I tried to dig up one of those tideclams that she likes─a good-sized one, too─but a claw shot out from under the sand and almost clipped my arm off..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERMAN03351_000_013","Say, you seem the capable sort. Do...do you think you could lend me a hand?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERMAN03351_000_014","Oh, thank you! You should be able to find the spot I was digging not far from the water. Just watch out for those snippers!"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERMAN03351_000_015","The clam I was trying to get was over there, closer to the water. We'll be feasting well tonight if you can claim it from those ghastly claws!"

62,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERMAN03351_000_023","In fact, I'm sure she'll want to thank you in person. Come on─let's head back to the village!"

64,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_031","Aye, you're a proper pain in the posterior, you are! Here, take this and drop it off at the Leaky Keel!"
65,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_032","I hear you slew some shelled monster what came between him and that clam. A good thing, too─if he'd stood his ground, I'd be buryin' whatever parts of him was left."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_033","Thank you... The man has his faults, but strike me if I don't love him all the same."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERWOMAN03351_000_034","Now, I'd best be makin' somethin' to fill his belly when he comes back. A nice thick clam stew, I reckon!"
68,"TEXT_LUCKZA009_03351_VILLAGERMAN03351_100_030","Th-Thank you again, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>. I might still be floundering about on the sands if it weren't for you."
