49,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_002","What we require here is a strategically placed sachet of ground Kholusian sage. The trouble is, I'm not quite willing to die in the process of obtaining said herb."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_003","But what of you, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>? There is sage aplenty near the Clave should the promise of reward overshadow any fear you might have of stabbing tooth and rending claw. Two generous bunches should suffice!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_004","You'll find patches of sage over to the west, near the Clave. Two large handfuls of the herb would be most appreciated!"

53,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_011","Yes, this is a goodly amount. My thanks! A moment while I prepare an experimental sachet..."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_012","I'll just grind these up...add a sprinkle of this...a dash of that..."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_013","And 'tis done!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_014","<sniff> Ah, 'tis akin to inhaling a springtime breeze! I must begin producing these fair-scented pouches in bulk!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_015","You, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>, have the privilege of putting my aromatic creation to the test. Place one of my sachets behind this foul-smelling shack, and inform me of the results!"

61,"TEXT_LUCKZA011_03353_TIOREEQ_000_031","Well, that is satisfying to hear! I shall continue manufacturing these pockets of sage and proceed with secreting them about the place."
