55,"TEXT_LUCKMC115_03336_ALMET_000_033","Strange indeed. The second statue was likely hidden to keep the door sealed."

64,"TEXT_LUCKMC115_03336_YSHTOLA_000_054","I sensed a strange energy emanating from the eyes of the statues in the corridors of this place. Should this figure be moved, it would not surprise me for them to suddenly stir to life."

67,"TEXT_LUCKMC115_03336_YSHTOLA_000_057","Which is why I would ask you to deliver this statue to the main chamber."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMC115_03336_YSHTOLA_000_058","An abundance of magick yet courses through these walls. For my eyes, distractingly so. I believe yours, on the other hand, would more aptly perceive the traps for what they are."
