50,"TEXT_LUCKZB004_03382_RIQIMAO_000_002","Anyway, we need as many people as possible out there looking for it. Its handler is leading the search─as he <Emphasis>should</Emphasis>─in the Forest of the Lost Shepherd. Go, go!"

54,"TEXT_LUCKZB004_03382_ZUN03382_000_012","That whistle produces a tone that all of our amaro have been trained since birth to react to. Blow it loudly, and then listen for his cry. If he's nearby, you'll know."
