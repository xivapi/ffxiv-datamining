49,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_RYNE_000_005","Considering the Blessed have only just recovered from their encounter with the Eulmorans, Thancred and the others thought we should stay a while longer to be sure they're all right."

55,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_030","Thank you for coming. I thought to keep my suspicions to myself, but after witnessing your victory at Rak'tika Falls, I fear they prove true, and so I must share them with you."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_031","From the first when we met at Fort Gohn, your aether has appeared...tainted. Suffused with an overabundance of light not unlike the sin eaters."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_032","When you defeated the Lightwarden, I fear the light which poured forth from it was not negated by Hydaelyn's blessing. Rather, it was absorbed into your being."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_033","Urianger also suspects as much, though he is unwilling to share his thoughts on the matter."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_034","One thing is certain: with every Warden you defeat, the danger to you grows greater. Greater perhaps than we can imagine. If you begin to feel anything strange─anything at all─pray inform me at once."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_035","You should hurry, before the others begin to worry. Once I have sorted my things here I will join you."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_040","Pray go on ahead. I would first attend to this unsightly collection of books."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_041","<sigh> I'd always complained that her cave was such a mess, books and scrolls strewn about like a child's playthings. Gods, I really <Emphasis>am</Emphasis> turning into her..."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_THANCRED_000_050","We took one last patrol of the perimeter. All things considered, Slitherbough remains relatively unscathed."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_RYNE_000_051","Thanks to the antidote, all those who were poisoned will make a full recovery."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_RYNE_000_052","And with the night sky returned, their prayers have at last been answered."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_053","Sorry to keep you all waiting. Shall we be off, then?"
67,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_URIANGER_000_054","Art thou certain this is best?"
68,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_055","...I'll not deny there is a part of me that wishes I could stay."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_056","For two years I have lived with the Blessed, learned their culture, even going so far as to adopt Master Matoya's name as my own. I but pray I did honor to it."

71,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_THANCRED_000_060","Hopefully the others will arrive before long."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_RYNE_000_065","I know he said he would be watching from the shadows, but doesn't it seem wrong to leave without at least telling Emet-Selch?"

74,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_080","All things considered, it is hardly surprising that Alphinaud and Alisaie have yet to arrive, but where is the Exarch?"

77,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_ALPHINAUD_000_083","I assume your presence here means you've brought word of the Warden hiding in Rak'tika?"
78,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_ALPHINAUD_000_084","Found and slain, you say? I should have known."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_MYSTERYVOICE_000_085","Eulmore has but recently dispatched soldiers to all corners of Norvrandt to defend them. I am glad to see their efforts were wasted on the Greatwood."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_THANCRED_000_086","Speaking of Eulmore, what came of your meeting with Vauthry?"
81,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_MYSTERYVOICE_000_087","Yes, about that. It proved to be..."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_MYSTERYVOICE_000_088","...Urgh."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_ALPHINAUD_000_089","Exarch, you mustn't push yourself. Your time away from the tower has clearly taken its toll."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_ALPHINAUD_000_090","No doubt you all are tired as well, having traveled so far. Why don't we all take a much-needed rest before we discuss our findings?"
85,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_091","I thought to propose the very same. After your clash with the Warden, you deserve a chance to recuperate."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_THANCRED_000_092","It's settled, then. We reconvene after everyone has had time to settle in."
