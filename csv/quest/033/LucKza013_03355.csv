50,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_002","Grrr! You would feel <Emphasis>honored</Emphasis> to meet me if I was ever allowed to test the limits of my instrument!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_003","One day I shall be the talk of Eulmore─nay, of all Norvrandt─but first I must secure a venue in which to practice."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_004","If I sing at but a fraction of my full volume, the cretins around here become so unreasonably angry! Insulting, even! Thus I have taken to finding a quiet spot near the coast."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_005","Yet even there, my scales and trills seem to drive the wildlife into a frenzy. I can scarce begin my practice before I'm forced to flee from some enraged beast!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_006","Hmmm, you look to have seen your fair share of fighting. What say you to standing guard and allowing <Emphasis>me</Emphasis> my fair share of singing?"

56,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_011","Ah, 'tis so invigorating to sing here─I feel as if my voice rings clear across the sea."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_012","Now, if you would be so kind as to intercept any nuisances before they ruin my practice, I should be most appreciative!"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_SYSTEM_000_013","The sound of singing is almost entirely drowned out by the waves crashing down below..."

60,"TEXT_LUCKZA013_03355_DIVA03355_000_021","And it's all thanks to you!♪
Let us return to town so I might show you the proper gratitude!"
