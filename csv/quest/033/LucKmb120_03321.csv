48,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_ALPHINAUD_000_000","It was pure luck that we managed to hold the Eulmorans at bay long enough for you to succeed─but we have earned some good fortune. And while it is plain we've not seen the last of General Ran'jit, I for one am glad to delay our reckoning with him awhile longer."
49,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_ALISAIE_000_005","It seems I was wrong about your friend. Had Feo Ul not stepped in, you'd be frolicking with the faeries by now."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_RYNE_000_010","I'm going to train harder. Having seen what you've achieved, it's the least I can do."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_URIANGER_000_015","Though the battle is over, the war is far from won. Let us fix our gaze upon the road ahead."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_020","I knew you could do it. And not only because of your blessing. You have a strength all your own, and it has seen us through many a trial."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_021","With the Warden defeated, I believe our work here is done. It is time we were going─<Emphasis>together</Emphasis>, needless to say."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_022","...To the bitter end─the fate of our two worlds being at stake, and all that."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_023","Now then, I suggest we hurry back to the Crystarium. Much and more may have happened while we were frolicking with the fae folk."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_024","That Ran'jit elected to pursue us makes me hopeful the city was spared Eulmore's attentions, but I would sooner see for myself."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_025","Besides, I believe I speak for us all when I say that I've had a bellyful of Il Mheg. Let us away before the faeries think to play with us again."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_ALPHINAUD_000_030","I see nothing out of the ordinary."

61,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_URIANGER_000_045","The city appeareth unchanged from when last I visited. There is the selfsame comforting hum of activity in the air."

65,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_055","He appears to be gone, but I won't be lowering my guard just yet."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_RYNE_000_060","So that was an Ascian... Thancred told me about them."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_URIANGER_000_065","That an Ascian of Emet-Selch's standing should willingly reveal himself unto us─and at this of all junctures─is...most interesting."

69,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_ALISAIE_000_071","Well, we've certainly been given much to ponder, but first things first: we should report to the Exarch."

74,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_MYSTERYVOICE_000_076","But let us not dwell on it here and now. I will have the details of your mission from the others. You, meanwhile, should get some rest."
