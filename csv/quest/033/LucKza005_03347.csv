49,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_ANTHIBERT_000_001","There's a boy, you see, who frequents the Cabinet regularly. Like so many of his peers, he has never experienced the world outside the Crystarium. And so he comes here, to catch glimpses of it in the pages of timeworn books..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_ANTHIBERT_000_002","I am certain that what he truly desires is to learn of the living, breathing world, however. The world as it is today, through the eyes of one who has seen it."

54,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_BOY03347_000_011","Oh! Then... Then... Can you tell me about the animals? There are a lot, right? Father says they're all dangerous, though. Is that true?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_Q1_000_012","Are all wild animals dangerous?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_A1_000_013","Most are only dangerous if you make them mad."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_A1_000_014","They're all dangerous. And scary!"

75,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_BOY03347_000_026","I'm sure now─I want to see the world! I'm going to study, and...and practice martial arts! Then, when I'm strong and clever, I'll go on an adventure!"
76,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_BOY03347_000_027","It does seem pretty dangerous out there, but I still want to know more about the world! And maybe see it for myself someday."
77,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_BOY03347_000_028","I guess there really isn't anything you could tell me that would be the same as seeing it, is there? I need to go out there myself!"
78,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_BOY03347_000_029","Thank you for letting me ask questions! And please tell Anthibert that I'm going home─I have a lot of work to do! I wonder if Father will let me practice with his axe..."

80,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_ANTHIBERT_000_031","I do believe in the magic of the written word. How could I not? But it's not quite the same as meeting someone who has been there─who <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> is <Emphasis>part</Emphasis> of the wider world."
81,"TEXT_LUCKZA005_03347_ANTHIBERT_000_032","I've never ventured far from the Crystarium myself, you see, so I know the wonder and fascination that comes from hearing the fireside tales of travelers. You have my personal gratitude for sharing a bit of that with our young friend today."
