54,"TEXT_LUCKMC109_03330_THANCRED_000_031","A bit far, perhaps, but we should be able to toss the bag through."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMC109_03330_THANCRED_000_032","Though we should probably loosen the ropes keeping it closed. Enough that it falls open when it lands inside."

70,"TEXT_LUCKMC109_03330_YSHTOLA_000_061","Perhaps the monument is further in."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMC109_03330_YSHTOLA_000_070","Yes, this is it."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMC109_03330_YSHTOLA_000_071","I will be but a moment. Keep watch of the entryway."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMC109_03330_YSHTOLA_000_072","On second thought, would you mind examining the murals on these walls while I look over this?"
74,"TEXT_LUCKMC109_03330_YSHTOLA_000_073","At a glance, I can tell they are old. Predating the founding of the Blessed and the Children, in fact."
