0,"TEXT_LUCKMB105_03306_SEQ_00","Thancred is trying to think his way out of the present predicament."
1,"TEXT_LUCKMB105_03306_SEQ_01","From what little he is able to make of the mischievous voices, Thancred believes that the pixies wish to play with you. He reasons that they may therefore allow you to find their village, Lydha Lran─if nowhere else. At his suggestion, the party continues along the path."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMB105_03306_SEQ_02","You soon arrive at the pixie settlement, but see no sign of its residents. Convinced this means their games have already begun, Thancred suggests that you search for a plant with a furled tip called a looking grass which should allow you to see them. Before you set about your task, you are warned not to respond to any voices that call to you, lest you fall prey to further mischief."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMB105_03306_SEQ_03","You succeed in finding the looking grass, but not wholly unscathed. You hurry back to Thancred that he might put an end to the pixies' games."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMB105_03306_SEQ_04","Thancred puts the looking grass to use, and moments later the pixies pop into being all around you. Unfortunately, they prove disinclined to let you continue on your way, and after a moment's discussion declare that you must lend them a helping hand. Heaving a heavy sigh, Thancred suggests splitting up to tend to the pixies' chores."
