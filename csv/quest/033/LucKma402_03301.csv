104,"TEXT_LUCKMA402_03301_GLYNARD_000_110","Aye, they swarm like angry bees around a queen. You need look no further than Holminster for proof of that. But attacks on that scale don't happen every day, praise the blessed shadow."
105,"TEXT_LUCKMA402_03301_GLYNARD_000_111","No, the more common threats are the strays. No one knows why, but every now and again, an eater will leave the pack to prowl alone. Those are the ones you run into on the road if your luck is foul."

108,"TEXT_LUCKMA402_03301_CYELLA_000_114","The Virtues showed up out of nowhere about three summers ago, and when historians heard the descriptions given by survivors, well...apparently they share an appearance with the villains who caused the Flood."
