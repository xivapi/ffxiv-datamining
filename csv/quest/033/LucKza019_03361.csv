51,"TEXT_LUCKZA019_03361_HIREDMAN03361_000_004","Still, I'm in no position to complain. Anything beats starving to death. Thing is, I'm down to my last couple of gil, and I won't survive another week if I don't meet the quota."

53,"TEXT_LUCKZA019_03361_HIREDMAN03361_000_006","Thank you, friend! I knew you weren't the sort to ignore the pleas of a desperate man. Anyway, we'd best be off. I'll see you outside."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA019_03361_HIREDMAN03361_000_010","Now, you might be wondering how we can coax the little buggers out of hiding? With explosives, of course! They're supposed to come crawling in droves whenever there's an earthquake, so we'll make one of our own."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA019_03361_HIREDMAN03361_000_011","I'll head east, so you go south. Let's meet back here once we've caught a few of the slimy sods."
