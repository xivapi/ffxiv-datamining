54,"TEXT_LUCKZB002_03380_CHATHWICK_000_013","But of course she would be─our whole family is from there, after all. I expect that she wanted to express her feelings by preparing food for us. She does that."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZB002_03380_CHATHWICK_000_015","I knew it! I don't think I could ever forget the sight of you, facing down eater after eater without ever once flinching─and it's not just me. You're an inspiration to all of us."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZB002_03380_CHATHWICK_000_016","Here's an idea─what if you passed these out to the rest of the guard? I'm sure that they'll be awestruck."

68,"TEXT_LUCKZB002_03380_CHATHWICK_000_031","I apologize for asking such a trifling task of you, but we lost a lot of people on that battlefield. Anything that might raise morale is well worth trying."
