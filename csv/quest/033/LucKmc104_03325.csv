73,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_043","She is as much a part of the Night's Blessed as any of us, and we are grateful for all she does in service to the Dark."

77,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_047","In a word, yes. But fear not, it is not too involved."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_048","Let us begin with something simple. Follow me."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_050","I thought Master Matoya kept her room dark because she didn't need the light, but they're all like hers, aren't they..."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_060","Should you see any of our people come to this chamber, they have likely returned from a journey beyond the borders of Rak'tika."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_061","We use the water stored here to cleanse ourselves of the Light's impurity."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_062","A simple and perhaps peculiar custom, but it is one of our most important."

85,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_075","Please, this will only take a moment."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_076","This will only take a moment, I promise."

88,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_081","And with that, you have been cleansed of the Light's blighted touch. How do you feel?"
89,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_082","I'm not sure, to be honest. Not refreshed, exactly, but I do feel different."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_083","Has this water been treated in some way?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_084","Only blessed by our priests. They are practiced in the arcane arts. As such, it is said their prayers imbue the water with a faint dark energy."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_085","A prickling sensation? No one has ever spoken of such a reaction before."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_086","I wouldn't say it was an unpleasant sensation, but I too felt something strange."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_087","Hmmm. The dark aspect of this water should have no discernible effect. Unless..."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_088","By the gods! Master Matoya was right─you <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> sin eaters!"
96,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_089","I jest, I jest. What you felt was likely no more than the chill of the water."
97,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_090","Perhaps now would be a good time for you to acquaint yourselves with the people of Slitherbough."
98,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_091","For that, I must teach you a customary greeting."
99,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_092","Allin tuta. In the language of Ronka, it is one of several ways one might say “good evening.”"
100,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_093","The world is not as safe as it once was, and this greeting lets us quickly discern friend from foe."
101,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_094","Is there a handshake or gesture we should know too? I would hate to offend anyone."
102,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_095","You need not worry. Merely speak the words “allin tuta,” and they will know you as friends of the Blessed."
