1,"TEXT_CLSFSH021_01108_SEQ_01","In order to test your understanding of the basics, Sisipu has bid you catch five Lominsan anchovies. These fish can be found in the waters surrounding Limsa Lominsa, including those directly outside the Fishermen's Guild."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH021_01108_SEQ_02","Before Sisipu can appraise your anchovies, Guildmaster Wawalago makes an appearance to do it for her. The fisherwoman takes the opportunity to chide the netmaster for neglecting his duties, but Wawalago remains unfazed. In any case, the two of them acknowledge your mastery of the fishing fundamentals, and encourage you to expand your horizons.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 5."
