1,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SEQ_01","The Fishermen's Guild has received an order for fresh fish from one of its regular customers, a Qiqirn merchant named Chuchuroon. However, it is unclear what fish Chuchuroon desires, which is why Sisipu has bid you speak with the client."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SEQ_02","You are no more successful than Sisipu at discerning the fish Chuchuroon glimpsed in the water, and the words “silver” and “jumping” appear to be your only clues. Consult with Sisipu about how you might proceed."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SEQ_03","Sisipu is equally perplexed by the description, but believes Wawalago may be able to elucidate. Seek him out at his spot in front of the Fishermen's Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SEQ_04","Drawing on his vast knowledge of fish, Wawalago has determined that the Navigator's dagger is the fish Chuchuroon seeks. Use rat tails to fish five out of the waters near the Brewer's Beacon in western La Noscea and deliver them to Chuchuroon."
5,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SEQ_05","The sight─and smell─of the Navigator's daggers put Chuchuroon over the moon with joy. Speak with Sisipu again to find out her opinion on your hard day's work."
6,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SEQ_06","Sisipu expresses relief at having someone both capable and reliable in you, albeit by bemoaning the lack of such traits among the other members of the guild. Take heart from her praise and continue to hone your skills should she require your assistance again.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 20."

56,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SISIPU_000_020","...Well, Chuchuroon has a way with words, doesn't he? Unfortunately, his way appears to be repeating the words “silver fish.” Only the most experienced fisherman would be able to decipher that nonsense."
57,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SISIPU_000_021","This sounds like a job for Wawalago, since I'm busy doing his job. Rest assured that what he may lack in sense, he more than makes up for in nonsense."

74,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SISIPU_000_051","So many of these freeloading fishermen can't be bothered to stay ashore for more than a day at a time. You, on the other hand, have proven far more reliable."
75,"TEXT_CLSFSH151_01111_SISIPU_000_052","I can think of at least one Qiqirn who'd agree."
