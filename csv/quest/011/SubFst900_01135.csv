51,"TEXT_SUBFST900_01135_NEDRICK_000_003","If the thought of delving into the past sets your loins afire, the keep will surely serve to quench it. The entrance is watched by a Wood Wailer named Maxinne. Give her my name, and she will tell you all you need to know."

54,"TEXT_SUBFST900_01135_MAXINNE_000_022","Alas, that splendor has long faded into memory, and the keep has become a lair for the Lambs of Dalamud, a doomsday cult. Some of the cultists have even succeeded in summoning voidsent, and we Wood Wailers welcome capable adventurers who would be willing to keep their numbers in check."
