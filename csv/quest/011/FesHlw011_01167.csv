57,"TEXT_FESHLW011_01167_IMPHEAD_000_023","The townsfolk, not accustomed to being without their guardians for even a night, quickly grew fearful of the common beasts around them. This spurred them to don the guises of specters and engage in all manner of mischief and revelry, that they might ward away the terrors─or at the very least, forget their fears until the dawn."
58,"TEXT_FESHLW011_01167_IMPHEAD_000_024","Sadly, such customs have fallen out of favor since the Calamity, with more pressing concerns leaving little time for idle celebration. So did the august leaders of Limsa Lominsa call upon the services of my humble band of thespians, that we might restore the tradition to its former glory."
