3,"TEXT_SUBSEA164_01150_SEQ_03","The clean scent of spring stars lifts the gloom of this lonely place, and Roehanth's aspect loses much of that brooding look. There is a tale that brings the rough Roegadyn soldier to his knees thus, one you may learn yet by speaking to him."
4,"TEXT_SUBSEA164_01150_SEQ_04","Before Roehanth, a headstone. Under the stone, a settler named Aerghaemr who breathed his last not on his farm, but holding a trail against the Sahagin as his comrades made their escape. Such is the man that this sergeant and former corsair has chosen as his lodestar."

56,"TEXT_SUBSEA164_01150_ROEHANTH_000_031","Aerghaemr was one of those, a farmer by trade. He stayed behind to cover the final retreat, asking for as many arrows as could be spared. Then he took off his boots and gave 'em to another, saying it wasn't far where he was going. And here he lies now."

But now, I got to be better than that, don't I? I got to be more like Aerghaemr."
