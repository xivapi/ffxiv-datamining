2,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_02","Medguistl states that her stores of highland tea leaves were depleted but a few bells prior to your arrival. She advises you to seek out Emanuel the wine seller, who plies his wares in the courtyard of Camp Dragonhead."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_03","Recognizing you from your previous escapades in Coerthas, Emanuel regretfully explains that his next shipment of highland tea leaves is unlikely to arrive for some time. This being the case, he proposes that you harvest the leaves yourself from the plants which grow along the riverbanks in Boulder Downs─adding that you may need to mind your surroundings whilst doing so."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_04","Braving all manner of unfriendly wildlife, you succeed in harvesting a sufficiency of highland tea leaves. Deliver your fragrant haul to Tataru, who is waiting outside the Waking Sands, and be done with this second errand."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_05","Tataru wastes no time preparing her tonic, and you listen with mounting disgust as she recites its ingredients in song. For a mercy, you are spared the full horror of the recipe when she abruptly remembers that a crisis has erupted in your absence."

51,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_TATARU_000_003","But for that, I require highland tea leaves─and the one merchant I know who sells them is completely out of stock. Harvesting them myself isn't an option, either, as the plant only grows in Coerthas, and I'm in no position to leave the Waking Sands at present."
