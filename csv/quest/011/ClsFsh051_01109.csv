1,"TEXT_CLSFSH051_01109_SEQ_01","Sisipu explains that different fish are drawn to different bait. To illustrate her point, she has instructed you to use pill bugs to catch three harbor herring, which can be found in the waters surrounding the lower decks."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH051_01109_SEQ_02","By delivering three harbor herring, you have demonstrated to Sisipu that you can delve inside the mind of a fish. She bids you continue thinking fishlike thoughts, that you might be ready for your next lesson.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 10."
