0,"TEXT_FESLGT003_01155_SEQ_00","Kipih Jakkya, reporter for <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>, wishes to enlist the aid of an adventurer.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESLGT003_01155_SEQ_01","Kipih Jakkya would like nothing more than to write an article about Lightning, the lady–knight with whom the public has developed an unhealthy obsession. To that end, she bids you seek Lightning out in the Coerthas central highlands, where the knight was last seen headed. Should you encounter the enigmatic figure, the reporter would like to hear of your experiences, as well as examine any evidence of her passing you might acquire.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESLGT003_01155_SEQ_02","You encounter the lady–knight Lightning as well as an unfamiliar mechanical enemy. After besting the gargantuan construct, she once again leaves behind an otherworldly parcel, which you bring back on your return to Gridania. After handing the parcel over to Kipih Jakkya, you are suddenly approached by Lightning herself. Though it appears the warrior has been sent to Eorzea against her will, she nevertheless expresses a growing fondness for the realm's vibrant beauty. Kipih Jakkya believes the parcel Lightning left behind is actually a gift meant for you─a sign of the lady–knight's gratitude for your timely assistance. Could this be the last you will see of the mysterious visitor?"
