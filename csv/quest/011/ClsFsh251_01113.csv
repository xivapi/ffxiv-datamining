1,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SEQ_01","Using the technique the acting guildmaster has termed “fishwheeling” (more widely known as mooching), you are to use a crayfish ball to catch a striped goby, and then recast the goby in order to catch a shadow catfish. The fish can be found in the waters surrounding Fallgourd Float in the North Shroud."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SEQ_02","Sisipu expresses her gratitude for the shadow catfish and seems genuinely impressed by how far you have come in the field of fishing.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 30."

50,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_002","This will likely require a bit of “fishwheeling,” if you know what I mean, though I imagine you do not, as I just invented that word. It means recasting a fish you've just caught as bait for a yet larger fish."
