1,"TEXT_GAIUSB104_00823_SEQ_01","You have learned from U'tykha Tia that a novice ranger of the U tribe, U'kahzuna, has gone forth to hunt anglers in the Sagolii Desert. However, she is long overdue for her return, and U'tykha Tia fears for her safety. With a susurrous sweep of his tail, the Miqo'te suggests you head southwest on a rescue mission."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB104_00823_SEQ_02","You have rescued U'kahzuna from the jagged maws of the approaching anglers. Though she appears to be none the worse for wear, she reproaches herself for failing to complete her mission. Return to U'tykha Tia in Forgotten Springs to hear what he has to say."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB104_00823_SEQ_03","U'tykha Tia judges the young one's failure to be no greater than those from his own youth. Out of the rawest novice may grow the finest ranger, if his tale is to be believed."
