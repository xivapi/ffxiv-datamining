If that were not bad enough, Kuzai Tazai has informed you that the group is led by an even more fearsome creature. Providing you with a concoction that might be used to debilitate the larger foe, the Lalafell has bid you slay five of the snippers so that you might lure him out."

3,"TEXT_GAIUSB203_00834_SEQ_03","You have heroically slain the formidable gripper, making the shores safer for the time being. Report back to Kuzai Tazai."

Nice to meet you! Even <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> so because I could use your help once again. It's those quakes that started up a little while ago.
