0,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_00","There is an air of mystery about Brother Barryn. He would bid you help him with a gift."
1,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_01","Barryn's heart is true and swift. Desiring to repay Father Iliud for his kindness, he has saved his gil─and, finding it wanting, enlisted your help. Your task is to raise more funds from both Brother Esmour within the church and Sister Zozoru at Camp Drybone."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_02","You receive a sack of gil each from Esmour and Zozoru without a single word of persuasion crossing your lips. In truth, you are slightly piqued, for you had taken some pains to prepare your cajolery. Give the sacks to Ermegarde."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_03","The gift is ready, made by Ermegarde's capable hands. Take the cinnamon cookies to Father Iliud at the Church of Saint Adama Landama."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_04","You present the cookies to a visibly moved Father Iliud. You can now return to Brother Barryn with the satisfaction of a job well done."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_05","You wonder anew at how few the Calamity left untouched. Ever has it been the lot of an obliging stranger to hear confidences from the low and the high, the guarded and the eager. Embrace your destiny."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_ERMEGARDE_000_036","I have given this matter much thought. A consignment of high-quality spices arrived just this day. Mayhap cinnamon cookies would suit? I have received many a kind word from my customers about my cookies, if I may say so."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_ERMEGARDE_000_037","I have also observed the good father linger at my store whenever a fresh batch was to be smelt coming out of the oven. But the only times he spent his gil on cookies and cakes, it was for the children of Lost Hope."
