1,"TEXT_GAIUSB006_00813_SEQ_01","You have learned from Gegeruju that a quartet of dancing girls who were due to arrive have not yet presented their lissome selves. The driver of their carriage is certain to be nearby. Find him and discover the whereabouts of the fair guests."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB006_00813_SEQ_02","According to the driver, the dancers have gone spinning off towards the beach, exclaiming over the beauty of the sea. Track down the four girls."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB006_00813_SEQ_03","You have spoken to each of the dancers, but have found them loath to cut short their play among the surf. Bear the tale back to Master Gegeruju."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB006_00813_SEQ_04","Though you are initially fearful of the Lalafell's reaction, Gegeruju surprises you by being completely understanding of the situation. How could any child of verdant Gridania or arid Ul'dah resist the blue ocean that cradles Costa del Sol? Always generous, Gegeruju has declared that he will wait until the girls have had their fill of the beach."
