1,"TEXT_GAIUSB314_00855_SEQ_01","In a wholly unexpected turn of events, Wheiskaet reveals that the banquet preparations were but an excuse for his comrades to evaluate your worthiness to face Titan. The other former members of the Company of Heroes are also in attendance, and the five warriors all agree that you have the necessary qualities to defeat the Lord of Crags. Their assessment now formally concluded, Wheiskaet decrees that all present should enjoy the festivities.

All present seem to have enjoyed themselves immensely, save perhaps for Y'shtola who seems loath to carouse with the other guests. Maybe you should inquire as to the cause of her reticence."
