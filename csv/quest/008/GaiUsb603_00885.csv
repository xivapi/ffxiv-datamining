1,"TEXT_GAIUSB603_00885_SEQ_01","You learn that voracious jackals have been spotted near Florentel's Spire. Having fled from snow-covered Coerthas, they are likely to be a danger to travelers. Idristan has given you a chunk of fetid dodo flesh to be used to draw out the beasts. Find a suitable place to set down the meat, and slay the jackals that appear."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB603_00885_SEQ_02","You have slain the jackals and made the area that much safer. Return to Idristan and inform him the deed is done."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB603_00885_SEQ_03","Idristan is pleased at the outcome, but remains frustrated about the situation. The Calamity has left Coerthas nigh uninhabitable, and the local wildlife have become more dangerous as a result. If you plan on heading northwest, the Quiverman warns you to be prepared."
