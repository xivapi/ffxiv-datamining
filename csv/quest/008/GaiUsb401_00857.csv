In this way, they bypassed the kobolds' defenses and traveled to the heart of Titan's sanctuary, aided by an unnamed Sharlayan. Search for the beastman aetheryte in Zelma's Run."

Just then, Y'shtola appears to teleport you back to the beastman aetheryte, instructing you to rendezvous with her at Camp Bronze Lake."
