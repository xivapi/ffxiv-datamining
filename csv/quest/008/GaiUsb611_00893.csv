1,"TEXT_GAIUSB611_00893_SEQ_01","Some Locks at Skyfire have little in the way of extra supplies laid in for hungry, shivering masses. Fortunately, the karakuls are dinner and dress in one. Cull them and collect their meat and skin."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB611_00893_SEQ_02","What does not ache of your hands is numb with cold, but the work is done. Deliver three each of the mutton slices and sheepskin to the four sentries at the Locks."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB611_00893_SEQ_03","You deliver the meat and skin to the four sentries, to varying responses. It is a curious fact that while Ishgard may worship one god, they no more speak in one voice than those who follow the Twelve, as is right and proper. Inform Sylvaintel that your task is complete."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB611_00893_SEQ_04","Clearly, Sylvaintel has come to trust not only your abilities but your discretion. He shares his fear that Ishgard faces an existential challenge─and while grateful for your aid, already he begins to ponder further preparations against the shadows of future tribulations."

I thank you for the delivery, you may go."

There has never been such a time as this. The shadows gather with alacrity, and we must make whatever preparations we can."
