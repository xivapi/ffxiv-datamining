1,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SEQ_01","After finding you in Solution Nine, Sphene agrees to take you on a tour, and begins by showing you the Nexus Arcade. Of particular note, you learn about the properties and applications of electrope, the miraculous ore which is used in virtually all things in Alexandria. After making a passing comment on what having such a material could mean in their world, a shop catches Wuk Lamat's eye."
2,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SEQ_02","The shop in question sells various foodstuffs, and Sphene purchases an item each for you and Wuk Lamat to try. This becomes something of an event as a curious crowd soon gathers to observe newcomers sample Alexandrian cuisine for the first time. You and Wuk Lamat duly partake of your selections, thus nourishing yourselves even as you delight the citizens."
3,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SEQ_03","Seeing that you are satisfied, Sphene next offers to take you to the residential sector, in part for personal business. At your word, she will lead you in the direction of your destination."

6,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SEQ_06","Upon arriving at the residential sector, Sphene explains that she is here to visit some people. Their apartment is located in the left building of residential radius 9-14, and you proceed through the entrance.

The boy is revealed to suffer from levin sickness, a debilitating disease caused by the pervasion of ambient lightning. The condition is common among children born inside the dome, but thus far no cure has been found, with soul technology ineffective against old age and illness. Seemingly overwhelmed, Sphene cuts her visit short and heads back outside."
8,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SEQ_08","Sphene thanks you for accompanying her, and explains that she wished for you to know about this aspect of life in Alexandria. She expresses her desire to find a cure, that the children need no longer suffer, and you take her resolve to heart as you look to learn more about her nation."

176,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_144","No matter your origin or race, occupation or regulator usage, all Alexandrian citizens are eligible for an apartment. This includes those you met who work in the outskirts."

192,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_ISADORA_000_164","You needn't worry about me, Your Majesty. You always make time for us, and we have everything we need."
193,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_165","I'm glad to hear that. But you mustn't strain yourself, understood?"

195,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_167","Unfortunately no. While souls can revive those who have met with an accident, they cannot reverse the effects of old age and illness."
196,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_168","Truth be told, many children are born like Milos. The illness has existed for generations, but we've been unable to find a cure."
197,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_169","The cause is quite clear, though─the excess lightning in the environment. It's no coincidence the number of cases has risen dramatically these past thirty years."

203,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_175","It's my pleasure, Milos. I'll be back soon, so be a good boy. For your mother and for me."

205,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_190","My thanks for accompanying me on the visit."
206,"TEXT_KINGME103_04934_SPHENE_000_191","The illness is a part of life in Alexandria, and I thought that you should know about it."
