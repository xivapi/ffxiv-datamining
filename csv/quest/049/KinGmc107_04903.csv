63,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_ALISAIE_000_031","Come to think of it, isn't it Bakool Ja Ja's home? We can only hope its residents don't share his winning personality."

67,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_HUNMURRUK_000_035","But since that time, most of the Mamool Ja who supported his peace have left their city in favor of abiding in the capital."
68,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_HUNMURRUK_000_036","What remains is a cloister of Mamook. And while these traditionalists do not take up arms against us, neither do they bear great love for outsiders."

70,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_WUKLAMAT_000_038","Well, we'll be on our way, then. I'm glad I could learn about where I came from. And eat so much xibruq pibil besides!"

84,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_ALPHINAUD_000_090","I spoke with one of the excavators on my way down. Apparently, Bakool Ja Ja cleared away the one fallen tree remaining by barreling through it."
85,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_ALPHINAUD_000_091","That Wuk Lamat single-handedly defeated someone possessed of such physical might is nothing short of remarkable."
86,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_ALPHINAUD_000_092","Still, we ought to proceed with caution. There's no telling what his wounded pride might compel him to attempt."
87,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_ALPHINAUD_000_100","We will doubtless face Bakool Ja Ja again. I cannot say I relish the thought of the reunion."

94,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_SYSTEM_000_130","As you hold the pairing stone in the soft glow, it affixes itself to the boulder with surprising force."
95,"TEXT_KINGMC107_04903_ERENVILLE_000_131","Pairing stones are natural magnets─and that's a meteorite filled with iron. One of many remnants of an ancient meteor shower."
