1,"TEXT_KINGLZ001_04967_SEQ_01","Grateful as ever for the role you played in revitalizing Wachumeqimeqi, Ropli requests a moment of your time to tell you about his next idea for the market. He sends you to await him at a venue more conducive to discussion: the Gornitruq Gleamsands."
2,"TEXT_KINGLZ001_04967_SEQ_02","As it turns out, Ropli is planning to hold an appreciation sale in Wachumeqimeqi, and he has recruited a slew of all-too-familiar faces to aid in the preparations. This endeavor is not to be without its challenges, however. In the interest of promoting further unity in Tural following the tumult of recent events, Ropli wishes to extend an invitation to the estranged denizens of the dome in Yyasulani. To that end, you have agreed to make the journey, familiar as you are with the people there. Shunye and Donuhanu are tasked with accompanying you, the pair champing at the bit to depart."
3,"TEXT_KINGLZ001_04967_SEQ_03","The road to the outskirts proved to be lively indeed, for your travel companions have each invited a companion of their own to join you. As the group takes in their surrounds, Donuhanu appears eager to get to work."

5,"TEXT_KINGLZ001_04967_SEQ_05","You find Donuhanu floundering, and his quarry, Luwatenine, a far cry from hooked. But when the topic turns to fishing─more specifically, your prized fulmisturgeon catch─the lure proves too tempting to resist. As for Shunye, his persuasive efforts are almost <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> successful with a local Shetona supplier, who seems quite interested in what Uvlo has to offer. With matters in Heritage Found seemingly under control, you are free to return to Wachumeqimeqi and check in with Ropli."

8,"TEXT_KINGLZ001_04967_SEQ_08","Aided by Halnaruk, Xeerol Ja is handing out free drinks to the passersby. She admits feeling insecure about offering samples to Alexandrian visitors, who she fears may balk at the flavors, though her Moblin companion believes she is simply overthinking the matter. Even so, you offer her words of encouragement, and she soon finds herself determined to win the Alexandrians over with her finest fizz. Halnaruk is wont to make light of her newfound courage, but before they can resume their squabbling, Xeerol Ja suggests that you pay a visit to XRral Soj Metalwares to see the decorations currently under construction."
9,"TEXT_KINGLZ001_04967_SEQ_09","You arrive to find the two metalworkers busily building promotional decorations. As Papawni tells it, she designed them to look like Tuliyollan dirigibles in miniature, inspired by the balloons' service in keeping so many cultures connected.

But rather than let you slip off on another adventure, Ropli invites you to stick around and behold the fruits of your labor.

Indeed, they are one and all beads threaded on the great chain of commerce, and Ropli believes it is high time you joined in their merrymaking."
12,"TEXT_KINGLZ001_04967_SEQ_12","Now that the event has ended, Ropli expresses a final word of appreciation─for you. As for Tuliyollal, this market will surely continue to be a great source of community and commerce in equal measure."
