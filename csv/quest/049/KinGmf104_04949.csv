2,"TEXT_KINGMF104_04949_SEQ_02","As you search fruitlessly for Constancy, you are instead found by none other than Cahciua, who appears as she was as a living person. Having admitted that she had been an Endless all along, she offers to help with your mission to stop Sphene, but asks that you first consider a request of hers. To that end, she bids you join her at a place called Canal Town, which you can travel to from the nearby zip line station."
3,"TEXT_KINGMF104_04949_SEQ_03","You make the brief and exhilarating zip line trip to arrive at Canal Town, a charming and scenic zone built upon the water. There, Cahciua points out Endless going about their business, each and every one the very picture of happiness. These are the people Sphene strives to protect, and you cannot hide your shock when Cahciua reveals her request: to erase them all."
4,"TEXT_KINGMF104_04949_SEQ_04","Cahciua reasons that, if the Endless are gone, Sphene would have no motive to plunder aether from other worlds even should you fail to prevent interdimensonal fusion. Seeing the sense in her words, you agree to do as she asks while waiting for the Meso Terminal to become vulnerable. Before carrying out the deed, however, Wuk Lamat expresses her desire to meet the Endless, that she might better understand Sphene. Thus is it decided that you will speak with as many of the inhabitants of Living Memory as possible as you make your way to the terminals holding their memories."
5,"TEXT_KINGMF104_04949_SEQ_05","You speak with a number of Endless in Canal Town, learning what brings them joy. One of them, a self-professed gourmand, recommends the popcorn at the nearby stall, and you proceed there to satisfy your curiosity."

While you are shocked to discover that the food in Living Memory tastes like nothing to you, your reactions suffice to delight the gathered crowd. Afterwards, G'raha Tia mentions having seen a man who seemed to be frantically searching for something. Curious as to what the problem is, he asks you to accompany him to where he was seen."
