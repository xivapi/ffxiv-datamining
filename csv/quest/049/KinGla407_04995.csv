147,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_181","You are Gosaal Ja, yes? Grandson of a renowned collector, as we have heard."
148,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_182","I am, and my grandfather was indeed fond of showing off his collection. But how in the world did you know that?"
149,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_183","Well, that explains everything. Still, this is quite an unexpected visit."
150,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_184","And we thank you for indulging us. So, did your grandsire's collection contain anything that might resemble the stones we told you about?"
151,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_185","...Yes. Your description made me recall one of my favorites, in fact."
152,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_186","I'm sad to say I lost it when I was a child, though. But my memory of it is crystal clear."

155,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_189","As you heard, my grandfather served as a scout when the Mamool Ja and Xbr'aal were at war."
156,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_190","He was known as a swimmer without equal and used the cenotes to travel to every corner of the forest unnoticed."
157,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_191","“Cenotes”... Those are the springs which dot the forest, correct? Are you saying they connect somehow?"
158,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_192","Yes, a network of tunnels runs under the earth. One can travel the width and breadth of the forest─if you know where to go, that is."
159,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_193","I remember my grandfather said he found the crystal on a mission to Iq Br'aax. It was lying there on the cenote floor, as if waiting for him."
160,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_GOSAALJA_000_194","It's likely that he found it in Iq Rrax Tsoly, where the waters once ran red as blood. The Xbr'aal would bury their fallen warriors there, and none expected a scout to be bold enough to trespass."
161,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_195","...This story has promise."
162,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_196","The samples we found before were pulled from deep layers of the earth, formed at a time immediately following the meteorite's impact. There is no telling how far down these tunnels reach, but doubtless they pass through the same layers."
163,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_197","Naturally, material from these layers would corrode and settle at the bottom of the cenotes... Yes, this has promise indeed!"

168,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_220","So, this is Iq Rrax Tsoly. I find it hard to believe that these waters were once stained red with the blood of war..."
169,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_221","Luckily, the cenote is now clear, and our vision should be unclouded as we search. Or should I say, <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> vision..."

171,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_223","As you know, I was trained among the snowy mountaintops. You can imagine how poorly I might fare in a body of water."

173,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_225","Good, good. Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I have ever been able to depend on you when I find myself wanting. You shall be the example I strive to emulate in my future travels."
174,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_226","I shall stay here and await your safe return. Good luck."
175,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_229","Search the cenote for anything resembling the tears. I shall stand watch in case anything goes wrong, but considering I cannot swim, I must ask that you practice caution."
176,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_230","You...you made it! You were down there for so long, I began to fear the worst... You must be half fish for how indefatigable your lungs are!"

178,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_232","To the best of my recollection, this looks almost exactly like the stone Master Shunye had. Its shape...that unmistakable blue."
179,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_233","We did it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
180,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_234","It appears our intuition was correct after all. This crystal is a remnant of a grievous wound dealt to the earth. 'Twas the case in ancient times, and 'twas the case fifty years ago..."

185,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_252","Did you really find this in Yak T'el? But how?"
186,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_253","You...you dived to the bottom of a cenote!? But the waters are so cold, and the caves so labyrinthine...not to mention a single misplaced stroke would cloud your vision with sediment..."
187,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_254","Even so...here you are before me, and I'm more grateful for that than anything else. Shunye's Apothecary could ask for none more skilled, none more brave, than you two."
188,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_255","I'll start examining this right away. Soon we'll have our answers."

190,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_261","I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this fragment is made of the very same material as the Azure Tears I found in my ruined home."

192,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_UVLO_000_263","As to the true nature of those stones? And how your village met its fate?"
193,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_264","I am now certain that these stones formed much in the same way as obsidian does near volcanoes."
194,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_265","When minerals are melted by extreme heat, they cool into glassy lumps."
195,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_266","In this case, when the meteor struck, the heat must have not only melted the earth but sent it flying into the heavens."

198,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_269","The meteorite brought instantaneous destruction to the area of its impact. All the plants, animals, and people...gone. Their life force scattered into the air."

202,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_272","I believe these are more than mere lumps of glass. The blue light is the shining essence of all that was taken from me."

229,"TEXT_KINGLA407_04995_SHUNYE_000_311","You pose an interesting question. I can't say I had a particular destination in mind, so a trip across the salt would be as good as any."
