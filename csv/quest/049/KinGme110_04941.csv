58,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_000_031","It doesn't matter to me if she's an Endless. Whether she's “alive” like you and me or not."

61,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_000_034","I expect there are things she can't tell us. Not with Zoraal Ja watching. But at the very least, I'd like to know what the Endless are to her."

67,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_TAAPU_100_039","I'm relieved to hear that."
68,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_TAAPU_110_039","And to know that he has family who worries for him. Gulool Ja too must be glad."
69,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_120_039","Heh, I hope so. I'll try not to rush or force anything, though. It's for him to decide what I am to him."
70,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_130_039","My, what a pleasant surprise it is to meet you in these parts."
71,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_140_039","Sphene! What are you doing here?"
72,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_150_039","Visiting my people. Are you doing the same, perchance?"
73,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_160_039","I suppose we are, yes..."
74,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_170_039","Listen, there's something we'd like to talk to you about. Could we have a word in private?"
75,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_180_039","...So you know about the Endless."
76,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_190_039","While we may not discuss it openly, my people will have surely noticed that I haven't changed for hundreds of years. I've made no attempt to conceal my nature."
77,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_200_039","If I may ask, though, who was it that told you about the Endless? Only a few should be familiar with the concept."
78,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_210_039","I'm afraid I can't say..."
79,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_220_039","I bear no ill will towards this mystery individual, lest that be your concern. I'm merely curious."
80,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_230_039","Tell me, Sphene. You care for your people, that much is plain. And I assume you care for the Endless too."
81,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_240_039","Earlier, in Everkeep, there was something that you wanted to tell us. Was it to do with them?"
82,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_250_039","The Endless are as dear to me as my living citizens. They are as much my family."
83,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_260_039","But they can only be sustained by meeting certain exacting requirements. Thus far we've managed to do so, but should more people die, I fear we would be pushed beyond our limit."
84,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_270_039","Their preservation demands vast amounts of energy..."
85,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_280_039","Energy? I don't understand the workings of it all, but is there something we can do help?"
86,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_290_039","Then..."
87,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_300_039","Would you be willing to become Alexandrian citizens?"
88,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_310_039","Wh-What!? I have my nation─my people─to protect. I can't just become Alexandrian..."
89,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_320_039","Indeed...I suppose you cannot."
90,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_330_039","First you tell us to make peace, then you tell us to go home... What exactly is it that you want?"
91,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_340_039","The same as you, of course. To protect my people."
92,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
93,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_A1_000_001","Tell us more about the energy the Endless need."
94,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_A1_000_002","Is there something that only Zoraal Ja can do?"
95,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_350_039","That...I cannot say. I do not ask that you understand or like me. But I wish..."
96,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_SPHENE_360_039","I wish we had been born on the same side of it."
97,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_370_039","Hey, what do you mean by that? Wait! Sphene!"
98,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_380_039","Damn it..."
99,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_390_039","Well, I think we've kept everyone waiting long enough. Let's continue on to Everkeep."
100,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_400_039","And let's not tell Otis about our conversation with Sphene. I don't want to risk causing him pain."
101,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_000_040","I've gone ahead and apologized for us."
102,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_ALISAIE_000_045","A lot has happened, but the important thing is Gulool Ja is safe and well. Cahciua has been worried, so let's hurry back."
103,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_GULOOLJA_000_050","Eating together was fun. I hope we can do it again."
104,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_TAAPU_000_055","Thank you for stopping by to share the news. It gladdens me to know that Gulool Ja is in good hands."
105,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_ALISAIE_000_060","Lamaty'i is right. Let's have faith in everyone and do what we can."
106,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_000_070","This is the moment of truth. We have to hold Zoraal Ja here."
107,"TEXT_KINGME110_04941_WUKLAMAT_000_071","And I know exactly how to do that!"
