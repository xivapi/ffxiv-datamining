1,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SEQ_01","The grizzled gatherer stops you to explain that his days of gathering have come to an end and encourages you to take his place at Shunye's Apothecary. Although he is scarce on the details, he pledges that working for the shop will be a pleasant and fruitful experience. Shunye's Apothecary can be found at the far end of the marketplace, and the proprietor is always there to speak with customers─or prospective talent."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SEQ_02","Shunye greets you warmly and tells you about his shop─an apothecary which sells stones and plants that promote a healthy body. He explains a recent lack of proper materials has caused business to stagnate but then brightens when you offer your services. Your conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a Viera who introduces himself as Uvlo, who explains that he has traveled from Othard to learn about the Shetona tribe. Sensing an end to his troubles, Shunye proposes a test of your respective abilities. May you gather the best of what Tural has to offer!"

59,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_013","Heh... I've seen that look before. You're wondering just what sort of shop this is."
60,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_014","To put it simply, I purvey in goods which promote a healthy body and mind. Herbs to cleanse mild ailments, incense to calm the senses, stones to massage aching shoulders, and much more, as you can see."
61,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_015","Naturally, this requires the use of various plants and minerals which possess uncommon─and some would even say mystical─properties, which I acquire from discerning and trusted gatherers."

67,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_021","I am Uvlo Gahjewesfv. I hail from the village of Kuguma, located on the eastern continent of Othard."
68,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_022","I was traveling the Three Great Continents in an effort to expand my horizons, when I learned of a people similar to the Viera who live in Tural."
69,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_023","I wished to learn all I could of them, so I boarded the first ship across the sea I could find. Once at port, I asked where I might find any Shetona, and was pointed here."

73,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_027","Uvlo, was it? I know you've come far, and I can sense your sincerity. But my conversation doesn't fetch so high a price─simply purchase one of my wares and we can chat for as long as you like."
74,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_028","I...have no money."
75,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_029","Not even a single coin. I spent my very last one hiring a ship to bring me here."
76,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_030","Ah. Then I can't very well expect your custom, can I?"
77,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_031","Apologies for the interruption, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Where were we...? Ah, yes. Would you agree to a small test of your talents before we begin our work in earnest?"
78,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_032","I suppose I'll be testing you, too. That is, of course, assuming you still wish to work with me."
79,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_033","Of course! I am at your disposal─you only need tell me what to do!"
80,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_034","Then your task is simple: bring me goods that I can sell to eager customers! There's no better way to take stock of your talents."
