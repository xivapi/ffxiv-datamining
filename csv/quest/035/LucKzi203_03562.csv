49,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_001","...What's that look for? A dwarf can't live on grog alone, though for some it ain't for lack of trying."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_002","Anyhow, the traditional side dish to a pint of dwarven ale is a nice big plate of dried iguana tails!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_003","Lizards don't just hand over their body parts, of course, so you'll have to go chop 'em off yourself. It's something of a custom to show off your best trophies and share them with your fellows come drinking time─a real bonding experience!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_004","You'll find iguanas─and their tasty tails─to the southeast of town. Two should be enough, seeing as them scalekin are so bloody huge. ...Oh, did I not mention that? Well, good hunting!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_005","Head to the southeast of here─that's where the iguanas tend to wander. You might try lopping off a tail and making a run for it, but you'd be better off expecting a fight."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_010","Ah, the mighty lizard hunter returns! What have you got for me?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_011","Oh! Look at the size of them wriggling beauties! Once we set those out to dry, the shrinking'll enhance the flavor so's you can enjoy the full lizardy goodness with every mouthful!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_012","And speaking of flavor, I've got the seeds steeped and sealed. For the next step, we need to store the ale-to-be in the brewhouse so it can ferment somewhere cool and dry."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_XORUTT_000_013","You up for it? Of course you are. Just roll this barrel over to the alewife, and she'll be happy to give it a home."

65,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_DWARFA03562_000_022","Gwahahaha!!! Trust me, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>─the more you have to work for it, the better it tastes! And the last step ain't near as grueling, I promise you."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZI203_03562_DWARFA03562_000_023","Go on with you, then, and give my best to Xorutt!"
