50,"TEXT_LUCKZI019_03555_RIOTT_000_002","...Ah, you wouldn't know your Riotts from your Ronitts, would you? The “Zigutt” I'm referrin' to is one of our ancestral chiefs─the mightiest warrior in Tholl history! You remember that name, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZI019_03555_RIOTT_000_004","Now, first things first, we need to prepare the offering. That involves you bringin' me a couple of soulstones from them rock-headed gnomes out in Scree. Try not to get flattened, eh?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZI019_03555_RIOTT_000_005","First off, we need two soulstones! You've got to take 'em from Scree gnomes, and let me tell you: they ain't goin' to cooperate!"

57,"TEXT_LUCKZI019_03555_RIOTT_000_014","Now for the ceremonial bit. You take these bottles, and empty 'em onto the four sides of Zigutt's statue over there. Every last drop, mind you!"
