49,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_002","I've even heard whispers that you've caught the eye of our Eulmoran patrons..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_003","What, no one told you? The whole system we've got here in the Crystarium first originated in Eulmore."
51,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_004","Once upon a time a few perfumed gentlemen were bored out of their wits and desperate for entertainment, and so they pooled their considerable resources and started placing bounties on dangerous beasts to attract hunters."
52,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_005","Their original intent was apparently to derive amusement from the gruesome deaths of those foolish and greedy enough to pursue these marks. A reprehensible pastime, wouldn't you agree?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_006","But people are stronger and more clever than many realize. Like you─one-nut marks hardly pose a challenge to you now, do they? All the more reason to pester Xylle for permission to take on two-nut bills."

57,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_XYLLE_000_052","Do bear in mind that should you die whilst in pursuit of a mark, you will receive no compensation."
58,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_XYLLE_000_053","You will also be dead, which would be an inconvenience for the both of us. We have great expectations for you, hunter."
