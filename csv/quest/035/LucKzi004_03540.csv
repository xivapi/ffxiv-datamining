55,"TEXT_LUCKZI004_03540_JAIMBERT_000_012","This wood you've brought me was sent up the Ladder back when the dwarves was more open to trade. Amity was neutral ground for strikin' deals, you see, and there was plans to expand the village once upon a time."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZI004_03540_JAIMBERT_000_013","So I guess you can say we're usin' the timber for its intended purpose...even if it is a few years late! Fare you well, friend, and thanks again for the help!"
