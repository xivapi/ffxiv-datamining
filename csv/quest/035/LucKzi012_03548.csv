What do you reckon your chances are of smashing a combat automaton?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_001","That's my job, you see─making contraptions what can protect the village from eaters and such. My latest and greatest invention is the “ironbeard killer”!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_002","...Well, maybe not the greatest. As soon as I turned the bugger on, it straightened up, twitched a bit, then raced right out the gate. And as much as I'd like to go after it, you never know what a failed automaton might do..."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_003","What's worse, I tuned this one to be extra aggressive. Like as not, I'd barely squeak out a lali-ho afore it pulped me into a bloody mess. I need you to forcefully disassemble the killer, and bring me back its core!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_004","Last I saw, it was trundling away to the southeast. Here, you can use this lump of coal to pick your battlefield─the automaton is designed to refuel if the opportunity presents itself."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_005","While it's stuffing its face with that, you can get in the first blow. And make it a good one! I didn't call it “killer” for nothing!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_006","Head over to the southeast, then use that coal to set up your ambush. Oh, and once you're done taking that bugger apart, don't forget to retrieve the core!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_010","Oh, you're back! Any luck retrieving that core?"

58,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_013","And it was no easy feat making one what's formulated for battle, let me tell you. I'd rather pull out my beard strand by strand than start again from scratch!"
