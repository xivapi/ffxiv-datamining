Beott welcomes you to the village of Tomra."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZI101_03556_SEQ_01","Beott welcomes you to the village of Tomra with a hearty “lali-ho.” To her dismay, however, it seems that her son, Ronitt, risks becoming a social outcast for his reluctance to maintain the same level of dwarven etiquette. She begs you to befriend the unfriendly boy, hoping that the rarity of a stranger's presence will help draw Ronitt out of his thorny shell...

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZI101_03556_SEQ_02","Beott introduces you to Ronitt, and the rebellious lad responds to the simplest interactions with snarls and posturing. Following your attempts at a brief “conversation,” it becomes clear that Ronitt has misplaced a family heirloom once belonging to a famous blacksmith. Beott sends the boy off to continue the search, and asks you to question villagers on the hammer's whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZI101_03556_SEQ_03","You speak with an affable townsdwarf. He commends you on your fine dwarven manners before pointing out another villager who may have picked up the hammer in question."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZI101_03556_SEQ_04","You soon learn that the timid townsdwarf did indeed retrieve Ronitt's carelessly misplaced heirloom. Taking charge of the hammer, you set off to return it to its owner."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZI101_03556_SEQ_05","You hand the hammer back to Ronitt, who grudgingly admits that you may not be the worst person he's ever met after all. Beott once more urges you to be a friend to her son, before leaving the two of you alone in uncomfortable companionship..."
