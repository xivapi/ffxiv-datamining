48,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_001","At last, eye contact. I know not why, but the other paupers who have passed through avoided my gaze most intently. Dreadfully ill-mannered, the lot of them. I should think they ought to be grateful for the opportunity to complete this task for me─an opportunity that is now yours."
49,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_002","In short, I require that you locate my manservant, who has served me faithfully for several years. He recently displeased me in adding a touch too much milk to my afternoon tea, and alas, I unthinkingly pushed him into the sea."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_100_002","I feel somewhat contrite about that now my mind has been freed of Vauthry's influence, of course─particularly as I've found myself entirely incapable of lacing my boots without assistance, and will be forced to wear these hideous shoes ere he returns."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_003","Searching for him myself is quite out of the question, naturally. If I could remember his name, I suppose I might call it out, but as matters stand, I am afraid I shall have to rely on you to seek him in my stead."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_004","The young man is a Mystel of considerable stature, with rather long hair─I do hope he's keeping it well groomed while he's away. I imagine he may be found weeping in the Derelicts or some such."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_005","When you locate him, please do convey my apologies for having acted in such haste. And tell him, lest there be any doubt, that I should be delighted to have him return to my service."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_006","Yes, yes, of course there will be remuneration for your services. Go on, off with you now."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_SERVANT03521_000_010","How can I help you?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_SERVANT03521_000_011","What!? Er, rather─yes, it is certainly I whom you seek."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_SERVANT03521_000_012","That the master regrets casting me into the sea does come as a surprise, however."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_SERVANT03521_000_013","For a blessing, I was rescued by some kind-hearted Ondo who happened to be in the area. However, I did feel compelled to offer them my spear in return."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_SERVANT03521_000_014","Tragic though it is, given that the master primarily valued me for my services as a bodyguard, it would be quite impossible for me to return to his employ now. Yes, it's out of the question, I'm afraid. Please give him my regrets, and tell him that I will miss him <Emphasis>dearly</Emphasis>."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_DAMMYA03521_000_015","Yes, he does sound like the sort of fellow who might mistake a Hume for a Mystel, I agree. But I'm afraid I've never set foot above. There's a man to the south who matches the description, though─he may be the one you're looking for."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_DAMMYA03521_000_016","Hm? No, I'm afraid I haven't had my hair cut recently. Though if you believe your employer may not be able to tell the difference, I would be happy to accept the role. I'm quite good at swimming."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_SERVANT03521_000_017","The master has my <Emphasis>fondest</Emphasis> regards, you understand."

66,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_031","Oh, dear─I daresay that spear was his only possession. But to replace it is a simple matter, and I shall do so forthwith, now that I know where he may be found."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_032","Ere I depart, do accept this as recompense for your services─it is but a pittance to me, I assure you."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZH011_03521_ARISTOCRAT03521_000_033","Now, I must make haste─he did say that he missed me dearly. I shall have to ask for his name, this time..."
