The bureau attendant seems to be regarding you like a lost young child..."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZK001_03592_SEQ_01","The Bureau of the Architect serves several functions, including the approval and regulation of “concepts” developed by the people of Amaurot, who have seemingly harnessed the power of creation itself to give form to anything and everything they can possibly imagine. To learn more about all this and more, the attendant encourages you to speak with others in the bureau waiting for their submissions to be processed.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZK001_03592_SEQ_02","The kindly Amaurotine tells you of their latest creation, a rather unusual boneless beast with semi-translucent skin and many tentacles that floats through the air. Though they doubt it will meet with the bureau's approval, they are not discouraged, for they take pleasure in the conception of unorthodox designs, and do not mind if others fail to see the beauty in their works."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZK001_03592_SEQ_03","The passionate Amaurotine explains that they are awaiting the verdict on their most recent submission: autonomous figures. Said figures are fiendishly complex yet devoid of emotion and fear, and thus will obey orders without question even if it leads them unto their own death."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZK001_03592_SEQ_04","The addled Amaurotine, thinking you to be a child and therefore a member of their target audience, implores you to test their creation before they submit it for approval. Furnishing you with a curious orb, they instruct you to head outside the bureau and use it to summon forth several playthings that you are to put through their paces."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZK001_03592_SEQ_05","The misshapen creations prove to be rather more belligerent than their architect likely intended. But fine art does not come exclusively from intent successfully realized. Perhaps the Amaurotine will take comfort in this."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZK001_03592_SEQ_06","Though somewhat distressed to learn that their creations were more akin to mad beasts than friendly playthings, the addled Amaurotine is not discouraged. They thank you for your assistance, adding that they look forward to the day when you will try your hand at creation as well."
