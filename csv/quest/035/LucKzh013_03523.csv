49,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_001","I'm low on lumber, but it'll take ages to get the work done if I have to stop and hunt down more materials. Can you bring me four solid-looking planks, for the time being? Some of the wood from the old sunken ships ought to still be fit for use."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_002","You're looking for wood that's not too waterlogged or splintered. Doesn't have to look appealing, as long as it's sturdy."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_SYSTEM_000_010","You notice a glittering object wedged in the crevice between two boards. Extracting it from its hiding place, you see that it's a ring─one that has fared rather poorly in the elements. Perhaps Tui-Shirr will know to whom it belongs."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_020","Did you find the lumber?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_021","What's this─a ring?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_022","Oh, this is a customs ring! They used to serve as authorization for traders to enter Eulmore."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_023","How do I know? Well, I used to work in the shipyard, as a matter of fact. Read a lot about its history at the time."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_024","Someday, I'd like to rebuild one of those old ships─make it fit to sail the world on grand adventures once again. It's a far cry from stripping the same vessels for shed materials, but a man can dream."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZH013_03523_TUISHIRR_000_025","I'll give you a portion of my pay for this job as thanks for your help. I thought about splitting my lunch with you instead, but the money is probably more portable. And considerably less ripe, at this point."
