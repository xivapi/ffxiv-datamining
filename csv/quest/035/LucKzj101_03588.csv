Naroshs Koal is eyeing you with naked interest."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZJ101_03588_SEQ_01","Naroshs Koal of the Ondo has taken a keen interest in you. However, before he questions you further, he asks that you accompany him outside the Cups. It seems there is something he wishes to show you...

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZJ101_03588_SEQ_02","Outside the Cups, Naroshs Koal presents to you a collection of rubbish likely dropped into the ocean from a ship as it sailed overhead. Unlike other Ondo, he has an insatiable curiosity for knowledge of finless ones and their ways, and so he bids you inspect the debris and tell him what purpose it once served."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZJ101_03588_SEQ_03","Your explanations have given the Ondo youth much to mull over. Indeed, he is like to remain lost in thought if you do not speak to him again."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZJ101_03588_SEQ_04","Naroshs Koal is grateful for your words of wisdom, but is nevertheless disappointed. Before you can press him further, however, an older Ondo, Xeroshs Ooan, arrives and scolds the youth for wandering off with you in tow. He then turns to you and explains that their clutchmother, who is pregnant, may not be able to give birth safely in the absence of water, and so they wish to entreat your assistance. You are to return to the Cups and speak with her directly."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZJ101_03588_SEQ_05","Xeroshs Ooan introduces you to the Ondo clutchmother, who speaks to you from the privacy of her chambers. Though the Ondo bear you no ill will for drawing back the waters of their realm, they hope that you will grant them the boon of knowledge, that they might learn how the finless ones ease the burdens of troubling mothers. As you are indeed responsible for this state of affairs, you consent to aid her."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZJ101_03588_SEQ_06","After your audience, Naroshs Koal explains that he had sought you out for the very purpose of aiding the clutchmother. She is mother to all Ondo, and so he would do anything and everything to comfort her in her hour of need, and so he prays that you will be able to help him achieve this end."
