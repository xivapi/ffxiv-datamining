Recalling that she spoke of the importance of eating food rich in nutrients, both to heal the body and to nurture the growing life within, the young Ondo would serve the clutchmother a hearty meal, made with the liver of a mnyiri─which he hopes you will procure in his stead.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

3,"TEXT_LUCKZJ102_03589_SEQ_03","Indeed, Naroshs Koal is very pleased by the quality of the liver you have brought. He asks that you hold on to it for now and present it to Xeroshs Ooan, who will inspect it and see it delivered to the clutchmother."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZJ102_03589_SEQ_04","As before, you are not permitted to intrude upon the sanctity of the clutchmother's chamber. However, her cries of delight as she feasts upon the liver make plain that your gift was well received."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZJ102_03589_SEQ_05","Naroshs Koal is relieved to learn that the liver was met with approval. There is surely much and more you can do to aid the clutchmother, though..."
