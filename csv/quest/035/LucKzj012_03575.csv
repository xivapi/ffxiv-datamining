51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ012_03575_ORTWIL_000_003","Aye, there's a crate o' fish what needs deliverin' to the Facet of Fishing. An' it just so happens that the boy's been talkin' my ear off about how he wants to be the one to do the deliverin' this time."

54,"TEXT_LUCKZJ012_03575_FISHERBOY03575_000_021","Anyway, if you want something from me, you're going to have to come back another time. I'm busy searching for the harpoon Papa lent me. I...uh, kind of dropped it, and before I knew it, it had sunk all the way to the bottom of the lake."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZJ012_03575_FISHERBOY03575_000_022","Wait a minute...if you're such a good swimmer, maybe you could dive down and fetch it for me! Yeah, I bet you could! You'll do it, won't you? "

62,"TEXT_LUCKZJ012_03575_ORTWIL_000_050","Ah, yer back. My boy's off to the Crystarium with a spring in his step. He's a willful one, aye, not unlike me when I was his age. But he's a good lad who loves the sea, and I'm proud he's mine."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZJ012_03575_ORTWIL_000_051","We live a simple life in these parts. Not much in the way of coin, high adventure, or what have you. But that's fine with me: that boy's the only treasure I'll ever need."
