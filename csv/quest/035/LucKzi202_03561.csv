51,"TEXT_LUCKZI202_03561_XORUTT_000_003","Now, most folk make their ale from barley, but not us dwarves. We use seeds harvested from the magma grass what grows on the slopes of Mt. Gulg."

54,"TEXT_LUCKZI202_03561_XORUTT_000_006","...What do magma blooms look like? Well, they're tall and orange and probably a bit sparkly. You'll know when you see 'em."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZI202_03561_XORUTT_000_011","Aye, that's enough seeds to stuff my helm and then some! Good work! This next part of the process is a bit tricky, so let's leave that to an expert. Which would be me."
