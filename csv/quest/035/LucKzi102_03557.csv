58,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_010","Oh, I see. You're thinkin', “He can greet some overgrown toy just fine, but he's too scared to talk to actual people!” You just don't understand me!"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_AUTOMAN_000_011","<bzzzt> You just don't understand me!"

65,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_022","I can't get around like I used to, what with this bent back of mine... Would you mind feeding that coal straight into Diligent Spirit there?"

67,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_030","Poured the lot in then, have you? Thank you, dear. You're as kind as our Ronitt."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_031","When he heard how my back was giving me trouble, that fine young lad went and hammered together my oddly named helper here. Hardly a day goes by when he doesn't stop past to see it's working properly."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_032","Aye, he's a surly boy, but his heart's in the right place."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_033","It's just a pity he handles his failures with frustration..."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_034","If he persevered with his greetings instead of lashing out, I'm sure he'd be capable of a lovely “lali-ho.”"
72,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_035","Actually, I'm surprised he even asked you to bring me my fuel. I've never known him to do that before─not with anyone."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_036","I've a feeling you'll be the one to get through to him, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>, so...be patient, if you can. Thank you again for the delivery!"
74,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_040","You delivered the coal to Xemutt, then!?"
75,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_041","Wait! She...she didn't say anythin' strange about me, did she?"
76,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_042","Anyway...th-thanks for the help. Maybe you and I can be friends after all. “Maybe,” I said!"
