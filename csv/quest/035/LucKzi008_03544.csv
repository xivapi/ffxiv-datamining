49,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_001","...What, you don't think a man could farm this land? Well, you seem like a well-traveled <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_002","Why don't you head over to my “field” back there, and take a look for yourself. I'd be curious to know what you think my chances are of taming this barren soil..."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_003","My “field” is just over yonder. It's not much more than a few mounds of dirt at the moment, but a man has to start somewhere, eh?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYSTEM_000_010","The dirt is bone dry..."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYSTEM_000_011","Nothing seems to be growing here..."

57,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_020","So, what did you think of my crop?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_021","Oho, one of the seeds had sprouted? That's wonderful news! I had no such luck with my previous attempt."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_022","Aye, even a small victory like that is worthy of celebration─it brings me one step closer to turning my little plot into the farmer's field I now dream of..."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_023","...A dream some say will never come true. And yet scratching here in the dirt has already brought me more fulfillment than I ever felt from the empty life I lived in Eulmore."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_024","Not that I wasn't terrified when they first kicked me out the gate, mind you! Exiled over some petty disagreement, and destitute but for the few pieces of jewelry I concealed upon my person..."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_025","The sale of those trinkets brought in some meager wealth, which has largely gone towards my agricultural endeavor."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZI008_03544_SYLGRAN_000_026","Thus, should my crops fail to produce a harvest ere my funds are depleted, I shall be left with nothing in this world. Ah, I have never felt so alive! Here, friend─a few coins for your services."
