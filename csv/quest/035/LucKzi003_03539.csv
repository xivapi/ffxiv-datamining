49,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_WALMET_000_001","I sent one of our newcomers to retrieve the supplies we had chilling in the river, and he has yet to return. I hope he hasn't run into trouble with the local dwarf clan..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_WALMET_000_002","If your travels take you in that direction, could you keep an eye out for our missing Mystel?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_WALMET_000_003","The newcomer─I've forgotten his name─was only meant to grab the sacks we had chilling upriver, then come straight back. I hope nothing bad has befallen him..."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_MYSTEL03539_000_022","I was just on my way back to the village when some Goggs started yelling at me. They were certainly cross about something, so I just ran away as fast as my feet would carry me...in the wrong direction, as it turns out."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_MYSTEL03539_000_023","Before I knew it, I'd collapsed here on the riverbank and dropped all my sacks into the water. They must've floated downstream, but I'm still...<puff>...too buggered...to go look for them..."

62,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_MYSTEL03539_000_033","Well, I'd best hurry home before I cross paths with them again. You should come too─no good deed should go unrewarded, after all!"
63,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_MYSTEL03539_000_040","Thank you again for your help. If you'd not found me, I might have fallen prey to some wild beast─or worse, a party of wine-drunk Goggs."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZI003_03539_MYSTEL03539_000_041","If only they were more like the Tholls. At least we can live alongside <Emphasis>those</Emphasis> dwarves in some semblance of harmony."
