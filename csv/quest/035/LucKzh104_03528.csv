Kee-Satt is ready to make his way into the darkest depths of the Dragging Tail."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_01","Having learned of a possible location for a vein of rutabite from Horthur, Kee-Satt has departed for the Dragging Tail. The inner reaches of the mine are said to be crawling with all manner of vicious cave dwellers, and the young miner is likely to have need of your protection.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_02","Kee-Satt prepares to begin digging close to the former entrance to another section of the mine, now closed off following a cave-in a hundred years prior. Since reopening the tunnel is a task requiring a whole team of miners, he decides instead to pick away at the fallen rubble nearby for pieces of rutabite that might indicate the presence of a vein deeper within. As he sets to work, you will need to keep any aggressive creatures away from him, although the sound of his pickaxe may draw unwanted attention."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_03","Thankfully, your first stint of keeping guard passes without incident. Kee-Satt's work, however, is far from over."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_04","There is still no sign of any hostile creatures, though with boredom beginning to creep in, the appearance of a flesh-eating cave beast might serve as a welcome distraction."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_05","Your patience is finally rewarded with the arrival of a ferocious denizen of the dark, intent on making you and Kee-Satt its next meal. The hapless creature soon lies at your feet in a crumpled heap while your friend continues his digging, blissfully unaware of the dangers you are facing on his behalf."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_06","Kee-Satt's efforts have once again resulted in the discovery of a piece of ore that may or may not be the fabled rutabite. The only way to be sure is to return to Twine to have it examined."
7,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_07","Kee-Satt can barely contain his excitement when he reveals that not only did he discover rutabite, but that it is of sufficient purity to produce Nabaathium. The celebrations are cut short by the unwelcome arrival of the Ronso miners who had been harassing Kee-Satt earlier, and to the surprise of none, they resume hurling inane insults. The young Mystel refuses to take the bait, and instead requests their aid in clearing the way to the source of the rutabite. While they initially express reluctance to cooperate, they are nevertheless impressed by his sincerity and agree to join his venture. In the hope that Mystel and Ronso may once again work together for the good of Twine, Kee-Satt leads the way to the Dragging Tail, but not before offering you heartfelt words of appreciation for your loyalty and support."

48,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_000","According to Horthur, it's in the Dragging Tail, first left. Now's as good a time as any. Let's be off!"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_010","This must be the place. The tunnels don't seem to be in such a bad state considering there was once a cave-in nearby."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_011","The old section of the mine is past those wooden boards, but it's all fallen rubble now. If Horthur's story holds true, there should be a vein of rutabite on the other side, although I won't be attempting to reopen the tunnel all by myself."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_012","What I can do, though, is try cracking into a few of these rocks to see if they contain rutabite."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_013","I'll need you to keep an eye out for danger, though."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_014","Thanks. Hopefully it won't come to that. Anyway, I'd better get to work."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_030","The sound of my pickaxe might draw the attention of cave dwellers, so we'll need to be on our guard."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SYSTEM_000_040","There is no sign of danger. You had best continue to stand guard while Kee-Satt goes about his work."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SYSTEM_000_050","There is still no sign of danger."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_060","Oh, did something try to attack us? Sorry, I was too engrossed in my digging to notice."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_061","But thanks to you, I was able to concentrate on the task at hand and even found something that might be rutabite."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_062","After the last time, I now know better than to start jumping for joy until I've had someone look at it. I'll see you back in Twine."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_070","There's good news and even better news!"
61,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_071","The good news is it's rutabite. The even better news is, it's almost entirely free of impurities! Finally, I can start making my own Nabaathium!"
62,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_RONSOMINER03530_000_072","What's this? Has the little Mystel lad actually found himself something worth a gil or two? At this rate, you might even be able to buy yourself a decent pickaxe instead of that rusty piece of scrap you insist on carrying around."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_073","For your information, I've found a vein of rutabite, which can be used to produce Nabaathium."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_RONSOMINER03530_000_074","You found what!?"
65,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_075","Not bad for a Mystel, eh? I'll admit, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Horthur played no small part."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_RONSOMINER03530_000_076","Why would Horthur help you!?"
67,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_077","Never you mind. The point is, this is just a sample of what's in the collapsed section of the Dragging Tail. But I'll not pretend I can clear out the tunnels by myself."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_078","If I'm to get anywhere, I'll need the help of the other miners of Twine. And that includes you lot."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_079","Just like in the days before the Flood, Mystel and Ronso must work together, as our ancestors did when they built the first settlement here. What do you say? Will you help me?"
70,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_RONSOMINER03530_000_080","So, you stumble across one lump of rutabite and all of a sudden you're the gods' gift to mining? Hah!"
71,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_RONSOMINER03530_000_081","If I thought you were spinning us a yarn, I'd have put you on your arse by now. But the fact you'd ask us, of all people, for help means you must be serious."
72,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_082","I am."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_RONSOMINER03530_000_083","All right, we'll do things your way."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_084","Good. You'll soon see what we Mystel are capable of. And once Twine starts producing its own Nabaathium, we'll be making gil hand over fist!"
75,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_085","I can't believe this is happening!"
76,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_086","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I wish there was more I could do to express my thanks. I'll make something of this town, you wait and see!"
77,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_KEESATT_000_087","Come on, you lot! To the Dragging Tail!"
78,"TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_RONSOMINER03530_000_088","(-Ronso Miner-)You heard him, lads!"
