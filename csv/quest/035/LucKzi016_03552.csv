Have you ever felt love's piercing sting?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_001","There's this Hume girl─no, this Hume <Emphasis>lady</Emphasis>─who's stabbed me right through the heart. I saw her on my way back from the mines, and I've been dreaming of her ever since..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_002","They say love is a dance, aye? Well, I've been watching from the edges for long enough─I think it's time I took to the floor!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_003","She should be on her way to fetch water from the river soon, but...
Gah, I'm too nervous to approach her alone. Would you come with me? Please, you've got to come with me!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_004","Thank you─you're the best friend I never had! Off to Boiled Owl Bridge we go!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_LADY03552_000_010","...Oh! I almost lost my bucket!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_022","Look, there she is!
This is it, then. I'm just going to...stay right here because I'm a big, bearded coward."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_012","...I need another favor from you. Will you ask her if she's wed? And if unwed, then what manner of man makes her swoon? Oh, and make sure to be subtle!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_013","I'm like to stumble over my own tongue if I try talking to her now. No, first I need you to ask if she's wed, or, if unwed, her preference in men. Perfectly innocent questions from a perfect stranger!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_LADY03552_000_020","Oh, weren't you the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lady<Else/>man</If> who was traveling with Alphinaud? He spoke very highly of you, you know. Said he admired both your strength of arm and strength of character."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_LADY03552_000_021","Now, what could such an admirable <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>fellow</If> want with a simple girl like me?"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_LADY03552_000_022","...Am I wed? Well, no...and I've no prospects to speak of, neither. Amity is not exactly bursting at the seams with suitors."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_LADY03552_000_023","...And if I were to pick a suitor? Gracious me, you are forward, aren't you?"
61,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_LADY03552_000_024","Hmmm... Well, it's what's on the inside that counts, isn't it? I would hope to meet a soul filled with warmth and kindness─someone much like how Alphinaud described <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>, I suppose."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_LADY03552_000_025","No, I've no interest in how a person looks. I'd seek a partner with your qualities─someone kind and generous."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_030","W-Well!? What did she say!?"
64,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_Q1_000_000","What did she say?"
65,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_A1_000_001","She looks for kindness."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_A1_000_002","Appearances aren't important."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_A1_000_003","She seemed to like me."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_031","...Kindness? What, like the sort of kindness you showed me...?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_032","Hm? Is that something other folk judge their partners by?"
70,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_033","In my village, it ain't considered polite to show your face until <Emphasis>after</Emphasis> you're wed. Helms stay on outside the family home! Still, it probably helps that she's not concerned with how I look..."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_034","...Sh-She did!? And here I thought I'd brought an ally, not a rival!"
72,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_035","<cough> Well, we should be heading back, then. It ain't right for me to demand help then leave you unpaid for your counsel!"
73,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_040","I was wrestling with the idea on the way home, and I've come to a conclusion: to win my lady's heart, I need to be more like you!"
74,"TEXT_LUCKZI016_03552_DWARF03552_000_041","I'll travel the world, and make of myself a man worth marrying. Aye, I think I need to have a word with the chief...
Thanks again for coming along, friend!"
