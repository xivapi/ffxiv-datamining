1,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SEQ_01","According to Father Saturnois, the scholasticate is awash with rumors that Archombadin was complicit in Ulaa's disappearance. Reasoning that the youth would never involve himself in anything which might endanger his reputation, nor less bring dishonor to House Dzemael as a whole, he is convinced that an outsider must be responsible, and implores you to look into the matter. Wasting no time, he ushers you in the direction of Lebrassoir, who has been frantically searching for clues as to the identity of the true culprit."
2,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SEQ_02","Unsurprisingly, Lebrassoir is adamant that Archombadin had nothing to do with Ulaa's disappearance, and he duly bombards you with evidence of his friend's innocence. However, he soon catches himself and abruptly changes tack, and after making you swear to tell none but Briardien what he is about to divulge, he produces volume eleven of the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis>, which he confesses to having found in Archombadin's room. Insisting that Ulaa must somehow be responsible for both the recent rumors, and the sudden appearance of the book in the prefect's dormitory, he hands over the tome, and beseeches you to find Ulaa so that Archombadin's name might be cleared. Now would seem a good time to apprise Briardien of all that has occurred."
3,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SEQ_03","Briardien is both impressed and slightly flabbergasted to learn that you have found the missing volume. Though he is somewhat skeptical of the seminarians' grand conspiracy theories, he acknowledges that speculation will avail you naught, and that further investigation is in order. While he seeks to learn what he can from the tome, he bids you make your way to the Brume and see if any there know of Ulaa─or failing that, know of any unusual happenings, for one can never be too well-informed."
4,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SEQ_04","Some of the residents of the Brume are more forthcoming than others, and while none of their information seems to pertain directly to Ulaa, two accounts in particular give you pause─one of a poor man come into a small fortune, and another of a rich man offering far too much for a simple errand. Though it seems unlikely that these incidents have any connection to Ulaa's disappearance, perhaps Inspector Briardien will think otherwise."
5,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SEQ_05","Briardien informs you that Ulaa was the last person to have removed the book from the library─a fact which could lend credence to Lebrassoir's claims. Still, it is a far cry from conclusive evidence. Seeing as how the power of the Echo will avail you naught under these circumstances, you have no choice but to rely upon the traditional methods of continuing to search for clues and question persons of interest..."

49,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SATURNOIS_000_001","That the boy scorns those who favor different interpretations of the scriptures I do not deny, but I labor to believe he would go so far. To engage in such conduct would risk not only his own position as prefect, but the very honor of House Dzemael, both of which mean a great deal to him."
50,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SATURNOIS_100_001","Regretfully, no one seems to know whence these ridiculous rumors came. They could have been concocted by anyone...and for any number of reasons."
51,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SATURNOIS_101_001","In any event, with many still unsure what to make of Ulaa's sudden withdrawal, these wild accusations have only served to deepen the divide between our seminarians."

53,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_SATURNOIS_000_003","Should you oblige my request, I suggest you begin by speaking with Lebrassoir. I am told he has spent the past few days looking into Ulaa's activities prior to her departure, likely with the intent to absolve Archombadin of suspicion."

57,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_LEBRASSOIR_000_012","I have known him since childhood. While he might occasionally seem somewhat high-handed, mayhap even callous, he would never do anything to harm anyone!"
58,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_LEBRASSOIR_000_013","If that is not enough, there is also the fact that in the days and weeks prior to Ulaa's disappearance, I was not out of his company for more than a few moments.

62,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_LEBRASSOIR_000_017","I...stumbled across this─volume eleven of the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis>. It had been conspicuously placed in Archombadin's dormitory room, with Ulaa's favorite bookmark tucked between its pages."

65,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_LEBRASSOIR_101_018","Were I a braver─and more foolish─man, I would march down to the Brume and demand answers. But you, a hero blessed with the strength of a hundred need not fear for your well-being there as I do."

70,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_BRIARDIEN_000_023","I continue to be amazed by what ridiculous conspiracies these children can convince themselves are true. As if the future of Ishgardian society shall be shaped by the actions of some few ambitious seminarians..."
71,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_BRIARDIEN_000_024","Anyway─I will allow that she may have been “consorting” with others who supported reformation. And were she persuaded to engage in rebellious acts, the dormitory prefect would have been an ideal target."
72,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_BRIARDIEN_000_025","Alternatively, Archombadin was so arrogant and careless that he thought nothing of leaving incriminating evidence in plain sight. He would hardly be the first."

74,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_BRIARDIEN_000_027","In the meantime, I would have you go and speak with the people of the Brume. See what they know, if anything, about Ulaa─where she might have gone, whom she might have visited, and so forth. Failing that, keep your ears open for news of unusual happenings.

77,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_GIBRILLONT_000_041","This hasn't got anything to do with your missing girl, mind, but a few days back, this one fellow comes and pays his tab in full. A surprising development, as I'd long since written it off as a loss. Came into money, he says, and has a mind to settle his debts. Pleased as I am by his changing fortunes, all the while I'm wondering who he left bleeding in an alley to get that much gil at once..."

80,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_GOLDIN_000_041","He tossed a purse at my feet saying the gil in it was mine for the taking. All I had to do was head to the Crozier and buy him a couple phials of cough syrup.

93,"TEXT_CHREND202_02208_BRIARDIEN_000_055","Nothing...but that is to be expected, is it not? Again I am reminded how ridiculous the two scenarios presented to us purporting grand conspiracies truly are. Is it not more likely that both the girl and Archombadin are innocent of wrongdoing?"
