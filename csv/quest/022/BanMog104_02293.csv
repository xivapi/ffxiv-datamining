Mogek the Marvelous is flitting back and forth, a dissatisfied frown on his plump features."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_01","The baskets Mogek ordered have yet to arrive, and he is afraid he will be left without any means to transport the heaps of fabrics soon to be completed. While he awaits the first of these shipments, Mogek asks that you go and investigate the reason why the baskets have yet to turn up. Travel to the Sohm Al summit and speak with one of the basket-weaving moogles.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_02","The moogle explains to you, with perhaps a tad too much enthusiasm, that the reason he has fallen behind is because he is having trouble harvesting sankchinni shoots─the main material used to create their wares. He asks that you go and harvest three."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_03","You quickly find and gather three of the sankchinni shoots you promised the apprentice basket weaver. Return to the Sohm Al summit and deliver them to him."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_04","As you prepare to return to Mogek with a report, the novice weaver stops you to ask for one final favor. He requests you to synthesize a few basic basket components, which will serve to accelerate the pace at which the weavers can construct baskets. Once you are finished, he asks that you see they are delivered to the managing moogle.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mendicant moogle."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_05","You fulfill the young moogle's final request by delivering the basket-weaving components to the Mogmender in charge of overseeing the project. With the help of the items that you crafted for them, he is certain he will be able to finish all of the baskets Mogek requires a bit more quickly. Return to Bahrr Lehs and report to Mogek the Marvelous."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_06","Mogek is crestfallen to hear that his projected estimates were off by so much. He decides he must use this opportunity to revise his expectations and mitigate any further repercussions this delay might cause."

49,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_MOGEK_000_001","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I'm terribly sorry to have to impose upon your generosity, but might you go and investigate the cause of this delay on my behalf?"

52,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_BEGINNERMOOGLE02293_000_011","I-I know that disappointed look. You think I'm lying! I'm not, kupo! I'm only one basket away from fulfilling Mogek's order─well, maybe two─but that's only because I'm unable to gather the necessary materials!"
53,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_BEGINNERMOOGLE02293_000_012","You see, I need sankchinni shoots, but it takes quick hands and incredible precision to pluck them! Please, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>, would you bring me three?"
54,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_BEGINNERMOOGLE02293_000_013","I cannot afford to fall any further behind. I must get back to work, kupo!"

61,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_BEGINNERMOOGLE02293_000_023","To ensure a quality basket I need metal clips─something I have no experience forging. I-It's not as bad as you're thinking, kupo! I have the materials right here!"

68,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_CRATEMOOGLE02293_000_041","It's about time, kupo! Thank you, for bringing these to me. With them, I shall be able to finish my baskets that much faster, and soon escape that pompous fool's cheeky smile and grating voice."
69,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_CRATEMOOGLE02293_000_042","Please tell Mogek to hold on for just a bit longer, kupo! We shall have the baskets delivered the moment they are finished!"
70,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_CRATEMOOGLE02293_000_043","Just a little bit more to go, kupo! Once the handles are securely fastened and they're given their finishing coat, all other baskets will pale in comparison!"
71,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_BEGINNERMOOGLE02293_000_044","Wh-What is that look for? I'm working hard. I swear I am, kupo! I'll even prove it. Feast your eyes on─ Oh, bugger, the blasted winds tore it apart again..."
72,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_MOGEK_000_050","It would seem I underestimated the amount of time that must be invested in weaving baskets, kupo. At this point, I suppose there is nothing to do but wait."
73,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_MOGEK_000_051","However, this brings us no closer to solving our current dilemma. Without the baskets, I have no way of transporting the fabrics we'll soon be receiving. <sigh> I must revise my estimations to ensure this has no lasting consequences, kupo."
