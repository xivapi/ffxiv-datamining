※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA504_02274_SEQ_01","Goblins have requested a variety of herbs to be used in the filter of their masks. Because they requested so many, however, the Vath keeneye has decided to split up the work. He asks that you travel to Avalonia Fallen and retrieve leaves from two of the ten herbs requested─specifically, Danner sage and Whilom mint.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANGNA504_02274_SEQ_03","The Vath keeneye quickly prepares and packs the herbs for an impatient goblin waiting nearby. However, he does not seem eager to complete the delivery in person. He explains that the Vath have not yet grown accustomed to the peculiar look of goblin masks, and cannot help but laugh at the sight of them. Rather than offending his client, he asks that you take them over in his stead."
4,"TEXT_BANGNA504_02274_SEQ_04","The goblin's anger is replaced with joy when he sees the fine selection of herbs you brought. He happily makes his way back to Idyllshire, practically singing of the profits he will make."
