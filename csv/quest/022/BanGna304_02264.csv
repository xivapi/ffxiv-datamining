※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA304_02264_SEQ_01","Relations between the Vath and hunters of Tailfeather are improving by the day. However, a recent rash of animal attacks have hindered travel and trade between their two settlements. The Vath keeneye, eager to preserve their burgeoning friendship, asks you to survey the area and slay the beasts that plague travelers in the forest.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANGNA304_02264_SEQ_03","You return to Loth ast Vath to find the Vath keeneye with a look of relief about him. He confesses they received this request some time ago. Upon hearing there were bears, however, they decided it best to wait for a hunter─one such as yourself─to handle the job. He hopes someday the Vath will muster the courage to undertake these more daunting requests."
