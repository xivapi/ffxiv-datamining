※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_01","Mourn has been overrun by pesky dinosaurs, and the Adventurers' Guild is asked to find a way to reduce their numbers. Deciding it to be the safest course of action, the Vath keeneye sends the Vath braveheart to steal their eggs. What was to be a quick job has resulted in the braveheart disappearing for days and now the keeneye needs someone to find─and possibly rescue─his friend. Travel to the caverns of Mourn and look for the braveheart.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_02","You speak with the Vath braveheart, who is paralyzed with fear but adamant about seeing his duties through. Search Mourn for a tyrannosaur egg and deliver it to the braveheart."
3,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_03","You pick up one of the tyrannosaur eggs. Deliver it to the Vath braveheart."
4,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_04","In his panic the Vath braveheart forgot to tell you that he must take back two tyrannosaur eggs. He would like for you to bring him another. Search Mourn for a second egg."
5,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_05","Your last trek through the caves seems to have given you a good idea on where to find the dinosaur eggs and you are quick to locate another one. Pick it up and deliver it to the Vath braveheart."
6,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_06","The Vath braveheart is very upset that the Vath keeneye did not disclose to him all the necessary details before having him embark upon this mission. In a trembling voice, he claims that he will be staying behind in the caverns of Mourn with the beasts he so fears as a form of protest."
7,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_07","The Vath keeneye is stunned and insulted to learn that the Vath braveheart believes him to be unworthy of managing their Adventurers' Guild. He shakes his head and tells you that running an organization is a great deal more difficult than he had ever expected it to be."

58,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_BIBIRI_000_031","He told us to go and steal eggs. He did not tell us that we must steal them from such ferocious beasts! We are very displeased. The keeneye is not the keeneye─he is...he is the Vath dulleye!"

60,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_BIBIRI_000_035","Adventuring is not all it is cracked up to be. It is riskier business than we thought. Though, much and more of this risk can be attributed to the keeneye not doing his job properly!"

62,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEARCHER_000_041","We sent him to gather eggs because it seemed much safer than sending him to <Emphasis>slay</Emphasis> the troublesome dinosaurs. If he found this task to be too scary, then maybe the braveheart should change his name. He can be the Vath trembler or the Vath panicker. They are both much more fitting, we think."
