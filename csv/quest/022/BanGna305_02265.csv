※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_SEQ_01","The hunters of Tailfeather have requested a particular set of goods found only within Loth ast Gnath. Unable to sneak past their heightened security, the Vath keeneye asks you to raid the enemy settlement in his stead.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_SEQ_03","The Vath keeneye is pleased to see you return safely. As you hand over the spoils taken from the Gnath stronghold, you cannot help but notice his quizzical expression. He tells you these items are a special food reserved for soldiers of the Onemind, which is why he is so puzzled by the hunters' plans. The paste, he says, will be used for rearing chocobos.
