1,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_SEQ_01","Denston mentions that Eynzahr had been hoping to speak with you on the subject of Hullbreaker Isle, and sends for the off-duty storm marshal before you have a chance to object. Soon after, Eynzahr appears in his civilian attire and proceeds to apprise you of all that has occurred since you salvaged Mistbeard's coffer. In a bid to discourage treasure hunters and put the island's remoteness to use, he petitioned Admiral Merlwyb to reserve Hullbreaker for the training of Maelstrom recruits. However, Eynzahr confides that he thinks the Grand Company's finest could do with some exercise themselves, and beseeches you to play the role of sparring partner during a coming drill. Join Denston in Moraby Bay when you are ready to set sail."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_SEQ_02","With the mists around the Cieldalaes having obligingly parted, Denston deems it safe to set sail for Hullbreaker Isle. Assemble your party while the Maelstrom sees to its final preparations.

※Hullbreaker Isle (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_SEQ_03","You run the Maelstrom's gauntlet, battling your way through a horde of slavering beasts and, somewhat unexpectedly, pirates. After a bemusing interlude involving the ladies of the Sanguine Sirens and the carnivorous pet of the Kraken's Arms, the drill appears to be brought back on course as you spar with the Maelstrom's elite forces. Having defeated the Grand Company's finest, you find yourself in the presence of the Admiral, who came to witness the duel with your final opponent─Eynzahr Slafyrsyn himself. Though the storm marshal had originally intended to face you as an officer of the Maelstrom, at Merlwyb's prompting, he dons the mask of the legendary Mistbeard before engaging you in earnest. For all his strength and cunning, however, he is no match for the Warrior of Light, and the drill concludes with your victory. Bear word of the day's events to Denston back in Limsa Lominsa."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_SEQ_04","Before Denston can press you for the details of your triumph, Eynzahr appears and assures him that every soul in Limsa will know the tale soon enough. The storm marshal duly compliments you on your performance against beasts, infantrymen, and buccaneers alike. When Denston subsequently expresses puzzlement at the pirates' role in proceedings, Eynzahr explains that they invited themselves in their capacity as the Maelstrom's “Black Sails” unit. Hearing this, the young man teases Eynzahr that he only permitted them to intervene out of curiosity to see if the old sea dogs could still hold their own in a fight. No sooner have the words left his lips than he notices Eynzahr's bruises, and realizes that he too participated. Visibly embarrassed, the storm marshal stiffly thanks you for taking part in the drill and excuses himself, leaving Denston to lament his commanding officer's advancing years. Though it is questionable if losing to you could be considered a sign of infirmity, you cannot help wondering how formidable Eynzahr must have been in his heyday..."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_001","Glad to see you back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Every time I hear your name, I'm reminded of how you helped me salvage that coffer from Hullbreaker Isle. You did me a great favor, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Though the rumors of Mistbeard's treasure soon died down, I couldn't abide the thought of having the <Emphasis>Haar</Emphasis> picked apart by vultures."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_002","So I petitioned the Admiral to sanction the establishment of a camp on the island for the purpose of hosting training exercises. I reasoned that the place was remote enough to give our recruits a proper taste of combat."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_003","But truth be told, with all the administrative duties asked of them these days, I'm more worried about our finest going soft. Sparring with your comrades might keep the rust from your blade, but it won't stop it going dull. That being the case, I thought I might ask for your help in a little sharpening exercise─remind them what it feels like to be in a real fight."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_004","Aye, the chief was hopin' ye might run the Maelstrom's trainin' gauntlet an' give our elites a good goin' over. Nothin' <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> rough, like─just a few missin' teeth an' the odd cracked rib, savvy? Assumin' yer willin', come an' find me at the Moraby Drydocks when yer ready an' I'll arrange passage to Hullbreaker for you and yer mates."
53,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_009","The boat that ferries the men to Hullbreaker casts off from the Moraby Drydocks. Meet me there, an' I'll get ye squared away."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_010","Ever since we took control o' that rock, it's been my job to keep an eye on the skies over the Cieldalaes. When the misty mane o' the Doxy's Pull sweeps in, there ain't no point weighin' anchor as ye can't see an ilm in front o' yer face."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_011","Long story short, I have to stay here an' watch the weather, but I'll be listenin' out for word o' how you get on. Thanks for agreein' to do this, by the way. Havin' a fabled hero like yerself go through the same regimen as the infantrymen'll do wonders for morale."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_012","Anyroad, the weather seems to be behavin' just now, so let me know when yer crew's ready to be ferried over. We'll get everythin' else in place in the meantime. Give them storm elites a bloody nose from me, eh?"
57,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_018","Ye don't have no shortage o' followers at Maelstrom Command, y'know. When the storm elites heard ye was runnin' the gauntlet at Hullbreaker, the only folk as didn't volunteer was the ones what already had. Roster was full before the chief could say “<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>”."
58,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_019","'Tain't what you might call a definitive pattern, but I've noticed the mist tends to thin after the gales o' great storms sweep over from the Rhotano. 'Tis as if the Navigator's clearin' the way for us, eh?"
59,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_020","Well? How was it? Did ye give them elites the hidin' o' their lives or what? Come on, out with it!"
60,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_021","Patience, lad. All of Limsa will know the tale ere long."
61,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_100_021","'Twas a sight to behold, that much I will say. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> comrades carved their way through beasts and men like a cutter through a swell. Not even a visit from the Sirens and the Krakens could slow their pace."
62,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_022","Eh!? Pirates turned up at the drill!? What in the seven hells did they want!?"
63,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_023","Why, to do their civic duty, of course. They invited themselves, as members of the Black Sails unit. You'd be forgiven for forgetting, but the pirate powers are still bound to the Maelstrom by the Galadion Accord. Of course, they never deign to take part in our exercises, and we've long since stopped asking."
64,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_024","As for why they chose to grace this one, I reckon word got out that the Warrior of Light would be facing our finest and they fancied a go themselves. I saw no reason to deny them."
65,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_025","Hah! Admit it! You wanted to see if them old cutthroats could still hold their own in a fight!"
66,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_026","Er, beggin' yer pardon, Chief, but...are you all right? Ye look a bit...sore. Don't tell me you..."
67,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_027","I... I deemed it good for morale. But I did not come here to speak of that. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─the Maelstrom is grateful for your participation. <If(GreaterThan(PlayerParameter(52),0))>May you sail with us<Else/><If(GreaterThan(PlayerParameter(53),0))>May we count you a friend<Else/>May we count you a friend</If></If> till sea swallows all.

68,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_028","Ack! I'd have stowed away on the ferry if I'd known the chief'd be fightin'! Seein' you in action must've woken the spirit o' the golden age in him."
69,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_029","Though I doubt he's as spry now as he was back then... I hope ye didn't give him <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> bad of a beatin'. Legends like Mistbeard never get old, but the chief, well...he's just a man."
70,"TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_DENSTON_000_030","Ah, but let's keep this little chat between ourselves, eh? Good to see ye again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Thanks for helpin' out the chief."
