Mogek is in need of a master crafter's touch."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG201_02294_SEQ_01","The Mogmenders are planning to restore the walls surrounding Bahrr Lehs. Unfortunately, they lack the supplies to do so, leaving the moogles no choice but to scavenge for serviceable material. Mogek asks that you meet with these scavengers at the Landlord Colony and see if they have found anything worth using.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG201_02294_SEQ_02","You come across one of the moogles tasked by Mogek and he seems overwhelmed by the volume of rubble to be sifted and sorted. In the hopes of speeding things along, he asks you to help him search for potential crafting material."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG201_02294_SEQ_03","Your efforts in searching through rubble have rewarded you with three prime pieces of salvageable material. Take back what you have found for appraisal."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG201_02294_SEQ_04","The rummaging moogle is pleased with your find. Combined with materials found prior to your arrival, he supplies you with the ingredients to synthesize supplies for repairing the wall. Once completed, return to Bahrr Lehs with the items.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the rummaging moogle."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG201_02294_SEQ_05","Mogek is pleasantly surprised by the set of newly crafted supplies you offer to him. With these in hand, he plans to waste no time in setting the Mogmenders to work."
