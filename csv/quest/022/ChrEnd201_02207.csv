1,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_01","Briardien tells you that while change has come to Ishgard, ill-feeling between the low- and highborn yet festers, with tensions rising by the day. The inspector is convinced that the recent hostilities are the result of a carefully laid plot conceived to further the interests of a party or parties unknown. Though he has yet to discover what their ultimate aim might be, he is not without a plan. Certain that the unexplained disappearances of Ulaa and volume eleven of the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis> are somehow related to the scheme, he declares his intent to find the missing girl by tracking down the missing book. While he continues to search for the tome, Briardien bids you inquire as to whether the students have heard anything concerning Ulaa's whereabouts or, failing that, observed any unusual goings-on."
2,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_02","You speak with the students of the scholasticate, who are mostly preoccupied with their studies or else talking amongst themselves. As you continue making your rounds, however, it becomes clear that not everyone is present, and that two pupils in particular are notable by their absence. Ask Father Saturnois if he knows where Theomocent and Leigh might be."
3,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_03","Father Saturnois reveals that ever since Theomocent and Leigh learned of Ulaa's disappearance, they have devoted all of their energies to finding her, determined that she should resume her studies. With this apparently in mind, they begged leave to travel to Gorgagne Mills, and duly received it."
4,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_04","You arrive at the abandoned settlement to find Theomocent and Leigh kneeling in prayer. At your approach, the former rises to greet you, and reveals that Gorgagne Mills is the resting place of the boys' late mentor, Father Choisseau. He goes on to explain that the two of them often visit the grave when they are feeling lost or uncertain. Interpreting your unexpected arrival as a sign from on high, the two students seem satisfied that their time has been well spent, and resolve to return to the scholasticate forthwith. Follow in their footsteps, and report their deeds to Father Saturnois."
5,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_05","Upon learning what his two best pupils were doing in the western highlands, Father Saturnois seems wholly unsurprised, acknowledging that Theomocent and Leigh had always held the man who raised them close to their hearts. Far from feeling misled, he is pleased to see that their feelings for Father Choisseau are as strong as ever, and heartened by the concern they have shown for their fellow students."

As you will doubtless have seen for yourself, change is sweeping through Ishgard, and the veil which once threatened to smother the hearts and minds of our people is slowly but surely being lifted."
49,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_BRIARDIEN_000_001","'Tis as if our fair city has been born anew─and it is in large part thanks to you. Which is not to say our problems have come to an end. No, the silent struggle between the lowborn and highborn goes on, growing more fractious by the day."
50,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_BRIARDIEN_000_002","I have come to believe that someone, somewhere is fanning the flames of hatred to further their own ends, and I am convinced, now more than ever, that Ulaa's sudden disappearance, alongside that of volume eleven of the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis> is no mere coincidence. Both she and it, after all, were passionate advocates of equality among men."
51,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_BRIARDIEN_000_003","As to who is responsible and what their true intentions might be, I cannot say... Ascertaining these things will no doubt require that we first find the missing girl, and as of this moment, our best hope of learning her whereabouts may rest on discovering the fate of the book."
52,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_BRIARDIEN_000_004","As such, I shall continue searching for any clue which might lead us to the missing tome. In the meantime, I ask that you trouble the students for any information they might have on Ulaa. Failing that, find out if they have witnessed any unusual occurrences around the scholasticate. Anything at all.
Well then─let us be about it!"
53,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_BRIARDIEN_000_009","Even the most seemingly insignificant oddity can be all it takes to crack a case. In any event, there's a good chance that whatever the students have seen or heard will offer us some clue as to the culprits' next move."

59,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_RIGOROUSSTUDENT02207_000_010","The lessons of volume eleven seemed to resonate deeply with Ulaa. She would oft stay up into the small hours reading and rereading them...

64,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_CRAMMEVOIX_000_011","Ha! He spoke to me, 'tis true─but 'twas not out of fondness! He merely hates me very slightly less than he values Ulaa's safe return."
