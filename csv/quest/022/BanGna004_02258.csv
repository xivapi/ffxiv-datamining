※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_01","After an awkward attempt at a prank, the deftarm is eager to tell you about a daring idea he has. In a bid to put an end to the colony's thieving of clay, he wishes to venture to Anyx Trine, another area rich with the deposits, albeit a lair of the Gnath's hated enemy, the Dravanians. Knowing well he would face certain death were he to travel alone, he recalls you have met with the dragons before, and requests you to accompany him to formally ask the dragons for permission to harvest the clay─an idea the Onemind would not dare to consider. 

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_02","At Anyx Trine, the deftarm trembles before the looming tower. Remarking to you that he may be the closest the Vath have come to the dragon's lair, he takes a deep breath and enters. Follow him inside, and proceed to Vidofnir's chamber."
3,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_03","Vidofnir grants you an audience, but is soon perplexed as to why you brought a Gnath into her presence. The deftarm quickly explains that he is Vath, not Gnath, and that they have a need to strengthen their settlement's walls. He further stresses that by aiding their cause, the Dravanians would benefit from their presence as a buffer between Anyx Trine and Loth ast Gnath. Still suspicious of his loyalties, however, Vidofnir declares that the deftarm must first prove he is not in league with the Gnath by slaying one. Despite his reservations, the deftarm has no choice but to agree."
4,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_04","You find a distressed deftarm outside Anyx Trine, at a loss how to proceed. You attempt to encourage your pupil, however his emotions get the better of him, and he asks to be left alone. Leaving him to wallow in pity, you set out to search for Gnath who may be lurking nearby, in the hopes he will join you."
5,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_05","Regrettably, the deftarm never appears to join you as you perform your fair share of Gnath-slaying. Return to Anyx Trine to see how he is faring."
6,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_06","The deftarm attempts to apologize to you, but he is soon interrupted by a remaining Gnath scout who escaped your view. The deftarm struggles with the Onemind's voices, but soon steels himself, affirming his identity and striking the Gnath down with his musket. He declares that he can no longer hear their thoughts, overcoming his biggest obstacle."
7,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_07","While the deftarm's slaying of a Gnath is a small victory, his duty remains incomplete. Return to Vidofnir and corroborate his success."
8,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_08","The deftarm declares himself triumphant in slaying a Gnath, and Vidofnir concurs, having seen it herself from the tower. As he has proved himself, she allows the Vath to partake of the clay deposits from within their domain. After both agree to work towards peaceful coexistence, the deftarm sets out for the colony to relay the news to the storyteller."
9,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_09","The storyteller and the fleetfoot can scarcely believe their ears when they hear that the deftarm was not only able to meet with Vidofnir and live to tell the tale, but was granted her permission to reap a precious resource. The storyteller is delighted to hear that the hive has finally weaned themselves from the Gnath's resources, and of the deftarm's personal victory of resisting the link to the Onemind. For the moment, Loth ast Vath seems to be turning out for the better...that is, until the deftarm falls deep into a trance, speaking in a different tone. The speaker soon reveals himself as the Overmind of Loth ast Gnath, using the deftarm as a mouthpiece with which to deliver a message: rejoin the main colony, or perish. When the deftarm regains himself, he is dismayed by the colony's crisis, and commits himself to finding a way to avoid war."

They require constant tending. Layers upon layers must be slathered over time. The walls of our hive have not hardened like steel, like Loth ast Gnath. Thin walls mean thin defenses."

53,"TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_UDEKIKI_000_005","This thought was too daring! Much too daring! I did not consider it at first, knowing the dragons are at war with the Gnath. While the Nonmind take care to avoid senseless bloodshed, we are not entirely guiltless. Not guiltless. Yes. We kill dragons, too."
