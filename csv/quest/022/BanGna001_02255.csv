Determined to make himself useful, the new Vath set out towards the Chocobo Forest in search of food to bring back to his brothers and sisters; alas, he has not yet returned. Worrying that the hunters may have mistaken him for a Gnath, the storyteller urges you to venture out to Tailfeather and inquire as to his whereabouts.

The nameless Vath, steadfast in his resolve to become an adventurer, offers to travel to faraway lands and obtain rewards for his services to lessen the Vath's reliance on the Onemind.

Fearing for the keeneye's safety, he asks you to check the bridge for dragons, but not to slay them for fear of reprisal.
