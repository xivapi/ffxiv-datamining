※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_01","The colony has used some of its newfound wealth to procure second-hand cannons for their defense. However, the cannons did not come with the stock of firesand required to operate them. Not to be discouraged by the Gnath's fierce guard of the sulphur needed to make the powder, the deftarm sought advice from Marcechamp. The hunter made mention of the Convictors of Coerthas, who own cannons similar to the deftarm's second-hand ones. The Vath adventurer concludes that the dragonslayers must have a large supply of firesand on hand, and is eager to make their acquaintance. Before making your way to Coerthas, rendezvous with the deftarm on the edge of the Chocobo Forest. 

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_02","You meet with an anxious Vath deftarm near the edge of the forelands, who remarks that this would be the furthest he has been from his home. But your journey is soon interrupted by a familiar foe."
3,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_03","You find yourself face-to-face with a Gnath brandishing a musket, whom you quickly dispatch. Afterwards, an ashamed deftarm explains that he was unable to join the fray because the voices of the Gnath struck fear in him. Turning his thoughts to the task at hand, he bids you continue onward to Coerthas."
4,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_04","The deftarm is overwhelmed by his first sight of snow. Unfortunately, he appears rather less comfortable in the cold. Shivering, he slowly makes his way towards the Convictory."
5,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_05","Jantellot quickly overcomes his astonishment at being addressed by a giant talking crab once the deftarm expresses his desire for firesand. The fledgling adventurer makes the mistake of declaring he will perform “any task” in exchange, prompting Jantellot to bid the Vath rid the camp of lesser dragons entirely. After failing to convince Jantellot to change his request, the deftarm is at a loss as to how to slay a horde of dragons on his own. However, recalling the Vathic methods of driving dragons away, he quickly departs the camp to search for herbs to make incense, but not before asking that you prepare a fire outside the camp."
6,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_06","You build a fire with the bundle of wood that Jantellot provided, and wait for the Vath's return. Just as the scouts have spotted lesser dragons flying over the ridge towards the camp, the deftarm appears with the dried herbs. He tells Jantellot if he lights them aflame, it will produce a smoke so potent that it forces dragons to retreat. The Convictor seems doubtful of its effectiveness at first, but is pleasantly surprised when he sees the results for himself. He offers firesand to the deftarm in exchange for more of the herbs to which the deftarm gleefully accepts. With mention of the guild and its services, a deal is struck between the Vath and the Convictor leader. Speak with the deftarm before you set off for Loth ast Vath."
7,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_07","The deftarm is satisfied that he was able to fulfill his quest, but expresses relief that he can now leave the freezing climate of Coerthas. Return to Loth ast Vath to apprise the storyteller of the developments."
8,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_08","You arrive at Loth ast Vath, but the storyteller informs you that the deftarm has not returned yet. Sensing something amiss, he asks you to search for him."
9,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_09","You find the deftarm in front of the colony. Strangely enough, it appears he lost his way on the path home. Speak to him once more at the Adventurers' Guild. "
10,"TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_10","The deftarm deems the trip to Coerthas a success, as he has been able to secure a supply of firesand for Loth ast Vath's cannons. Although the colder clime was not to his liking, he is pleased with his first journey outside of the Dravanian forelands. The deftarm dreams of seeing more of the realm, but his next foray will have to wait as his responsibilities as head of the guild will keep him busy for a while."
