※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA005_02259_SEQ_01","The deftarm, feeling responsible for the misfortune that has befallen the hive, reveals to you his idea to avoid war. Having faith in the strength of his individuality, the Vath adventurer intends to willingly submit himself to the Gnath to enter their colony. Once the Overmind is lured out to claim him, he would fell the king-like Gnath, ending his threat to the Vath. The deftarm tries to reassure himself of his cause before saying farewell to you and setting off for Loth ast Gnath.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANGNA005_02259_SEQ_02","You divulge the deftarm's plan to the storyteller and fleetfoot, who quickly deny its feasibility, explaining that the Overmind would be all too willing to use the deftarm. The fleetfoot also reveals that the Overmind cannot truly be killed, for where one dies, another soon appears. As time grows short to save the deftarm from completely losing himself, the storyteller bids you pursue him while he sends out the call for help."
3,"TEXT_BANGNA005_02259_SEQ_03","You discover the deftarm, but he has already submitted himself to the thoughts of the Onemind who surround him. You dispatch them in an attempt to quell their whispers. Speak to your pupil to see if he is yet himself."
4,"TEXT_BANGNA005_02259_SEQ_04","Your efforts to reach the deftarm prove fruitless, as he silently proceeds towards the Gnath colony. Continue to pursue him into the heart of the hive."
5,"TEXT_BANGNA005_02259_SEQ_05","You follow the entranced deftarm deep into Loth ast Gnath, where he is welcomed by the Overmind himself. The Overmind claims triumphantly that the Vath adventurer's individuality has been removed and he has taken his place among the Onemind once more. After berating mankind for their thirst of war and discord, the Overmind hisses at you to leave his domain. He uses his power over the deftarm to raise his musket toward you, but you stand firm, trusting in your pupil's power. The storyteller soon arrives with the allies the deftarm has gathered over the course of his travels, and they attempt to call out to him. Their voices soon reach him, and the Overmind senses the imminent threat posed by the deftarm's overwhelming sense of self. Shocked beyond comprehension upon losing power over his thralls and the deftarm's assault, the Overmind soon retreats to the recesses of its lair. As impending war becomes less of a possibility, the deftarm appears to be exhausted, and suggests everyone return to the hive."
6,"TEXT_BANGNA005_02259_SEQ_06","At Loth ast Vath, the deftarm attempts to thank his friends for coming to his rescue, but they brush aside his sentimentality, humor lost on the Vath. The storyteller explains how the colony has become an important part of others' lives, and their security will be guaranteed so long as the Adventurers' Guild continues to reciprocate the assistance they receive from others. The deftarm is grateful to you for taking him under your wing to guide him in the ways of adventuring, but assures you he is ready to stand on his own. In addition to his duties to the guild, he declares his resolve to continue training his skills so that he may one day embark on an adventure with you."
