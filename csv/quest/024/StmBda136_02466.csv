50,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_CONRAD_000_010","You saved a good many of my men, and I cannot thank you enough for that."
51,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_CONRAD_000_011","...But the fact remains: our forces were decimated. In this state, we'll not be mounting an assault on Castellum Velodyna or anywhere else."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_CONRAD_000_012","We need to be honest with ourselves about our prospects. But first, we need to put our affairs here in order. Afterwards, I'll join you all at Castrum Oriens."

55,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_ALPHINAUD_000_025","For more than a decade, the Resistance has resided here, hidden from the eyes of the Empire. And just when we set our sights on Velodyna, they strike. Do you not find that passing strange?"
56,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_RAUBAHN_000_030","Pipin has already departed with the wounded, has he? Good. We have completed our search of the Reach and the surrounding area."
57,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_RAUBAHN_000_031","As far as we can tell, Zenos and his men returned straightways to Specula Imperatoris after quitting this place. 'Twould seem he's lost interest in us."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_ALPHINAUD_000_032","Which brings us to the most troubling question of all─not how he found us, but why he chose to spare our lives having done so."

60,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_RAUBAHN_000_034","Whatever his motive, this is neither the time nor the place to think on it. I will leave a token force to watch over the Reach. The rest will fall back to Castrum Oriens. We can discuss our path forward there."

73,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_CONRAD_000_075","We'll stay in the Reach and rebuild. We'll reinforce our defenses. And if they come again, we'll be ready."

79,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_ALPHINAUD_000_101","And I am quite certain the same can be said of the Doman Liberation Front. Nevertheless, we can but go and assess the situation for ourselves, and see what can be done."
80,"TEXT_STMBDA136_02466_ALPHINAUD_000_102","Lest you doubt what good we few can accomplish, I would remind you that my grandfather and his twelve disciples once journeyed to these lands to save Eorzea and her people from certain doom. <If(Equal(PlayerParameter(76),1))>And you know only too well how that tale ended─albeit at great cost.<Else/>Brave souls with an impossible task. And Eorzea lives on.</If>"
