80,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_061","This road leads to the Ijin-gai: the district in which “ijin”─or <Emphasis>foreigners</Emphasis>─are permitted to reside."
81,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_ALPHINAUD_000_062","Would this also be where the foreign embassies are found─including that of a certain empire?"
82,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_063","Precisely. So you see, it would not be at all unusual to cross paths with one of our Garlean cousins here. With this in mind, I would encourage you to choose your words carefully. We would not want any physical altercations, after all, such spats being <Emphasis>strictly</Emphasis> forbidden!"
83,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_064","The Sekiseigumi punish breaches of the peace quite severely. I have seen foreigners permanently exiled for a single violation─though, to be fair, this is not common. More often than not, they are executed on the spot."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_LYSE_000_065","What, cut down then and there!? You're joking, right?"
85,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_066","Would that I were, but alas, these samurai are a humorless lot."
86,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_067","Why, I recall one instance when a foreign merchant in his cups dared lay hands upon a Hingan aristocrat in front of a Sekiseigumi. The samurai cut him in half with a single stroke."
87,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_LYSE_000_068","Ugh, I don't even want to think about that..."
88,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_069","So, as you see, it would behoove you to behave. Failing that, we may be forced to “part ways” with one another─or you with yourselves, in the manner of the late Teledji Adeledji!"
89,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_070","...Oh, how I amuse myself. But we must carry on! I have yet to show you the Garlean Consulate!"
90,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_LYSE_000_080","So that building's full of Garleans..."

92,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_TATARU_000_082","Danger! Excitement! Intrigue! Oh, my!"
93,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_ALPHINAUD_000_083","Compared to the Hingan architecture, this seems drab and uninspired. Or mayhap I have simply had my fill of Garlean aesthetics, such as they are."
94,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_090","This, as you may have surmised, is the consulate of you-know-who. Mark the guards at the gate─are their uniforms not different from those you have seen in the West?"
95,"TEXT_STMBDA202_02471_HANCOCK_000_091","Were you to travel far and wide, you would find that many such variations exist, often inspired by local designs. All of which goes to show that even a massive empire seeking to rule all of creation is not without its artisans!"
