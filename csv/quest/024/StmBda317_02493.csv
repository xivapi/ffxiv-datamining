76,"TEXT_STMBDA317_02493_MIYAMA_000_052","There is the Doman Enclave, of course, but that lies beyond the Dairyu Moon Gates. Needless to say, the imperials are disinclined to let any but their own pass."

80,"TEXT_STMBDA317_02493_HONAMI_000_062","Unfortunately, that has only made it harder for us to survive. You may have noticed, but we lack for a great many things. It was not much better before, true, but it has only gotten worse..."
