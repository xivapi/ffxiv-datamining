1,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_01","Kotokaze stops you, saying she has a letter for you. Quickly skimming through its contents, you learn that Cemi has arrived at Namai in Yanxia without incident. While she seems to be enjoying her stay there, a great portion of what she writes is dedicated to food. Perhaps it would be best if you were to depart for Namai posthaste and remind her of the purpose of her journey there─to continue her studies on oriental furniture."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_02","While initially Cemi is unable to speak of anything but food, a stern reminder from you is all that is needed to set her back on track. Once more the two of you decide to begin searching for anyone who might be in need of help."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_03","You come across a man by the name of Reizan, who was a chef in pre-imperial Doma. As the Garleans' grip on the lands weaken, he is looking to fulfill his lifelong dream of opening a restaurant. With limited funds, however, it has been difficult for him to acquire the furniture he needs. Cemi jumps at the chance to volunteer, adding that she would like to turn this into a competition between you and her to see who can better satisfy the client. Reizan does not oppose the idea, and requests that you make something to accommodate the dining habits of both enclave and country folk. To determine exactly what that might be, he suggests you speak with the local residents."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_04","Upon speaking with the nearby citizens, you learn that people from the enclave will only dine in a private setting, as they consider it rude to do so before strangers. This information should help you to decide on a suitable item to craft for Reizan. Perhaps now would be a good time to seek out Cemi that you might discuss ideas with her and receive the necessary materials."
5,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_05","Upon hearing that you intend to craft partitions, Cemi begins hurling accusations at you, convinced that you would never deign to create anything that simple unless you were attempting to lose on purpose. A simple explanation quickly calms her, and she apologizes. Handing you the materials you may need, she leaves you to make high-quality ornate partitions for Reizan.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Cemi."
6,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_06","Just as your client is about to decide on a winner, Timbermaster Beatin swoops in and begins offering his expert opinion. Though he declares that both are finely crafted, he refrains from further comment. All of you then turn your attention to Reizan. The chef declares that from the first moment, he knew your creation was the one he preferred, as it fulfills his request for something that would allow both enclave and country folk to dine in comfort. The competition now over, Beatin bids both you and Cemi return to Gridania."
7,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_07","Over the course of her studies in the Far East, Cemi has come to realize the importance of listening to her clients and adapting her furniture to suit their wants and needs. Having this most important of lessons firmly instilled within her, Timbermaster Beatin is confident that she will become a better carpenter for it. He thanks you for inspiring his young apprentice and asks you to speak with her one last time before you leave."
8,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_08","Cemi excitedly tells you that the timbermaster has deemed her worthy of taking on clients. While fulfilling commissions, she also plans to continue practicing making oriental furniture so as not to forget all that she learned during her stay in the Far East. It seems she looks up to you a great deal and hopes that she will one day become a master carpenter like you.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Cemi upon reaching level 70."

152,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_CUSTOMERC02444_000_174","Wait, sir! Come back! <sigh> I also had a request for him, but I suppose it'll have to wait. I should have known getting the finest carpenter in all of Gridania to make something for you wasn't going to be an easy task."

157,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_CEMIJINJAHL_000_179","My mother raised us by herself, working from dawn until dusk so that my sisters and I wouldn't go to bed hungry every night. As a result, she pushed herself too hard and one day, the pain in her back became too much to bear."
158,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_CEMIJINJAHL_000_180","Seeing her suffering drove me to make her an armchair in which she could rest from time to time. It was all the young me could think to do."
159,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_CEMIJINJAHL_000_181","While the finished product creaked and buckled under her weight, not for a single moment as I was making it did I lose sight of the fact that I was doing it all for her."

166,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_BEATINE_000_188","She is not the only one who owes you a debt of gratitude. While I am skilled at working with wood, I am not nearly so adept at dealing with people and their problems. You have helped Cemi in ways I could not."
167,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_BEATINE_000_189","You are part of the reason I have such high hopes for the girl. With a mentor like you to look up to, she will no doubt flourish. That is why I ask that you speak with her one last time before you leave."

171,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_CEMIJINJAHL_000_202","But that's not all. I'll be keeping the people we met there in mind. They'll help me to remember that I am making this furniture not for myself, but for those around me."
