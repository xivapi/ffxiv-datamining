※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST302_02422_SEQ_01","You promise Nonotta not to reveal the eggshilaration system's true nature to Jihli. Her mind set at ease, she turns her attention back to the festivities, and directs you to speak with her fellow Dreamer Motte when you are ready to ride on eggback.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST302_02422_SEQ_02","Motte gives you a rundown of the eggshilaration system's functionality, namely how to launch the shockobo. Hop on the egg now and use the shockobo on Nonotta.

※Speak with Motte at Hyrstmill to ride the eggshilaration system."
3,"TEXT_FESEST302_02422_SEQ_03","You use the shockobo on Nonotta, and it proves effective even on its creator, who shrieks out loud for the fright. Unfortunately, that effect was lost on Jihli, a result which has left Nonotta disheartened. For now, do your part in the festivities by seeking out three festival participants in the Twelveswood and startling them with the shockobo. Once you have three shock eggs for your troubles, deliver them to Nonotta.

※Speak with Motte at Hyrstmill to ride the eggshilaration system."

5,"TEXT_FESEST302_02422_SEQ_05","No sooner do you hand Nonotta the eggs than the three people you received them from come running up. In excited and appreciative tones, they tell of a rock-riding spriggan that gave them the shock of their lives. The news leaves Nonotta puzzled and perturbed, as spriggans aren't part of the plan. The creature in question has since headed to Gridania, and it seems likely that trouble will follow..."
