Right, then. Sister, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, Lyse─gather your things. We are for Limsa Lominsa."

71,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALPHINAUD_000_062","Not...exactly. You are right, in as much as we will be traveling by sea. Regrettably, it is simply not feasible for an airship to travel such a distance without impossibly large fuel reserves, to say nothing of the inevitability of running afoul of the Empire's aerial defenses."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALPHINAUD_000_063","...But then it is equally infeasible to sail an Eorzean Alliance vessel halfway around the world without the Empire taking notice."

77,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALPHINAUD_000_068","Not at all, Captain. Pray forgive my sister her outburst─she has ever been one to speak her mind. I, on the other hand, am the very soul of discretion, as many well-respected personages would attest, from the offices of the Admiral, to the High Houses of Ishgard."
78,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALPHINAUD_000_069","Ah, but where was I? Oh, yes! The Scions of the Seventh Dawn do indeed still wish to employ your services. However, it is important that you are aware of certain extenuating circumstances..."
79,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_CARVALLAIN_000_070","...And intent on securing passage to the Far East, you came to us, knowing us to be the proud purveyors of said region's finest spices."
80,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALISAIE_000_071","...Which you steal from gods-fearing merchants out on the high seas."
81,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_CARVALLAIN_000_072","Whatever privateering the Kraken's Arms may or may not engage in is strictly within the limits of the law, as set forth by our indefatigable keeper of the peace. More to the point, we are pragmatists. I see considerable risk in aiding your cause, and negligible profit."
82,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_TATARU_000_073","Well, I for one think the captain has a point. The five seas can be extremely treacherous, and many a poor, unfortunate soul has to come to grief out there on the waves."
83,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_TATARU_000_074","Why, when we were in Ishgard, I heard the tragical tale of how the heir to House Durendaire vanished at sea!"
84,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_TATARU_100_074","Even now, nearly twenty years later, the poor count remains <Emphasis>convinced</Emphasis> that his son still lives, and would pay a sultan's ransom for news of his whereabouts..."
85,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_CARVALLAIN_000_075","Hahaha... Ahahahahaha!"
86,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_CARVALLAIN_000_076","Truly a tragedy for the ages, and a testament to the misfortunes that may befall us should we act without...due consideration. But so long as you are prepared to abide the capricious whims of fate, I am willing to oblige you this once."
87,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_CARVALLAIN_100_076","That said, in light of the recent rebellion, I trust you understand that I cannot deliver you to Doma itself. I can take you only as far as Kugane, in Hingashi."
88,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_CARVALLAIN_000_077","We will require time to procure sufficient provisions and make ready for departure. I humbly suggest you do the same."
89,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_LYSE_000_080","I'm not sure what just happened. I could have sworn he was about to turn us away, but then he...changed his mind?"
90,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALISAIE_000_085","(Blackmail, is it? This is a dangerous game the two of them are playing... What guarantee do we have that Carvallain won't just throw us overboard?)"
91,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_TATARU_000_090","The poor little boy had only seen fourteen summers when he left Ishgard. Can you imagine what it must have felt like─to finally be free to explore the world, unbeholden to all the stuffy traditions of the Holy See?"
92,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_TATARU_000_095","Such a shame that he never returned home. Without him, the Count de Durendaire must look elsewhere for a successor...and the good Lord Jannequinard is one step closer to being the next in line..."
93,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALPHINAUD_000_100","Suddenly, all those hours Tataru passed cavorting and capering at the Forgotten Knight seem rather better spent, do they not?"
94,"TEXT_STMBDA137_02467_ALPHINAUD_000_101","(That said, I had intended to press the point more obliquely... And there was something disconcerting about the pleasure Tataru took in making Captain Carvallain squirm...)"
