1,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_01","While Widargelt is pleased with his growing membership of students, there are villagers still who doubt the authenticity of his style. In order to win them over, he plans to host a cross-discipline match pitting monks against pugilists. As a well-known face among the Pugilists' Guild, you have been tasked with delivering the invitation. Make your way to Ul'dah and broach the subject with Hamon."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Pugilists' Guild to find not only Hamon and Chuchuto, but Rurukuta as well, temporarily returned from his wanderings. All are responsive to the idea of a cross-discipline match, and the guildmaster formally accepts. Make your way back to Ala Gannha and inform Widargelt of the pugilists' coming."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_03","Widargelt is ecstatic to learn that Hamon has accepted the invitation, and he sets about preparing for the match. He bids you meet him directly in the Fringes at Schism, the chosen venue."
4,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_04","No sooner do you arrive at Schism than cries ring out from the river─D'zentsa and O'tchakha are in danger. Hasten after Widargelt to their aid."
5,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_05","You find Widargelt on his knees, handily bested by a band of men led by the mysterious Theobald, who claims to be the Griffin and the rightful King of Ala Mhigo both. He issues a stern warning against reviving the Fist of Rhalgr, and goes on to reveal that Widargelt is in fact his cousin, Theodred, who was raised at the Temple of the Fist in order to spare him the King of Ruin's wrath. Theobald then leaves, but not before declaring his intent to rule Ala Mhigo with an iron fist. With the immediate danger passed, you may turn your attention to your comrades."
6,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_06","In light of recent events, Widargelt has no choice but to call off the match, and he apologetically sends Hamon and his crew back to Ul'dah. While Widargelt checks on his pupils, take word of these troubling developments to Erik, now returned to Ala Gannha from his fieldwork."
7,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_07","Erik is unable to hide his shock at your report. The veracity of Theobald's words aside, the professor posits that his minions are members of the Corpse Brigade─elite soldiers trained in counter-monk combat, who once served Theodoric as his personal guard. Erik promises to investigate the many claims made, and bids you look in on Widargelt."
8,"TEXT_JOBMNK650_02428_SEQ_08","You find Widargelt deeply discouraged, not only by the sound drubbing he received but also the shocking revelation of his origin. For now, give your brother monk the time and space he requires.

※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 68."
