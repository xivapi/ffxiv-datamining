However, forces in both the Holy See and the island nation of scholars to the north would work to prevent her from accomplishing that very thing. Yet, with your aid and (to a far lesser extent) that of the nobleman Jannequinard de Durendaire, Leveva is able to thwart her enemies and open the door for bringing Ishgard into an all new era of astrological studies.

A quick chat with Jannequinard reveals that Lady Leveva, now going by the name of her father, is currently awaiting your arrival at the First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena."

3,"TEXT_JOBAST601_02409_SEQ_03","Much to Jannequinard's chagrin, Kyokuho is able to open the first gate with what appeared to be great ease. Now that your work is complete, it is time you return to the Athenaeum Astrologicum where Leveva continues her preparations for the symposium."

※The next astrologian quest will be available from Leveva in the Athenaeum Astrologicum upon reaching level 63."
