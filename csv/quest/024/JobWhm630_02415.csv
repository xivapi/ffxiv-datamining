0,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SEQ_00","Sylphie seems eager to speak with you."
1,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SEQ_01","Sylphie tells you of the hints of the disturbance she felt while accompanying the serpent scouts on patrol. Meet with her near Bittermill and investigate further."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SEQ_02","Whilst searching for the origin of the elementals' disquiet, you and Sylphie encounter the same strange girl you spotted once before. The child flees upon being discovered, and you hurry off in pursuit at Sylphie's urgent behest..."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SEQ_03","You find the trembling child being attacked by a pack of vicious voidsent, and act quickly to dispatch the fiendish creatures. Coaxed by Sylphie's gentle words, the girl then tells you her name─Gatty─and that she and her mother live in the borderland forest. Before Sylphie can tend to her wounds, however, you are both distracted by another surge of power, and look back to find that Gatty has disappeared. Convinced that the girl and her potent aura are connected to the disturbance, Sylphie suggests that a report to Brother E–Sumi–Yan is in order."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SEQ_04","Upon hearing Sylphie's summary of events, Brother E–Sumi–Yan agrees with her assessment. He surmises that Gatty's uncontrolled aetherial gifts are likely acting as a beacon for marauding voidsent─the presence of the malevolent creatures subsequently agitating the elementals. Return to Castrum Oriens once more, and help Sylphie with her plan to question the elusive girl at her forest home."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SEQ_05","Sylphie hopes that her search will be successful, but wonders if Gatty and her mother will be willing to talk. Thinking back on how the girl reacted to her offer of healing, the acolyte fears that an outburst of emotion might lead to yet another battle with the voidsent...

※The next white mage quest will be available from Sylphie upon reaching level 65."

49,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SYLPHIE_000_001","More than a few times I thought I sensed something─the briefest of flickers─but the scouts had their mission, and I couldn't risk getting separated from them to confirm my suspicions."

84,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SYLPHIE_000_040","Whenever she panics, I feel her aura just kind of <Emphasis>expand</Emphasis>─and I think the voidsent sense it too. And I'd wager three afternoons of listening to Hearer Nolanel's lectures that the presence of those fiends is what's upsetting the elementals."
85,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SYLPHIE_000_041","Right, then. It's time we returned to Gridania and reported our findings to the guildmaster."

87,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_ESUMIYAN_000_050","I have heard Sylphie's report, and you are both to be commended for pursuing this investigation in so dangerous an area."
88,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_ESUMIYAN_000_051","Judging by your description of Gatty's unusually potent aura, I am inclined to agree with the theory that it is her energies which are attracting the voidsent."
89,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_ESUMIYAN_000_052","If, as you suspect, the child lives alone with her mother, then it is unlikely she has been trained to control her power. Fear, panic, anger─any strong emotion might cause her aether to flare dramatically. To the ravenous creatures of the void, the “scent” of such outbursts would be as the sweetest of nectar..."
90,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SYLPHIE_000_053","So, if Gatty were to learn control, then the problem would be solved, wouldn't it?"
91,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_ESUMIYAN_000_054","We have assumed much, but know little. Without understanding the exact nature of the girl's gifts, I hesitate to propose a solution..."

93,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_ESUMIYAN_000_056","A fine idea.
<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, pray continue lending Sylphie any support she might require."

95,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_ESUMIYAN_000_059","Sylphie has conducted herself admirably thus far, but I am nevertheless reassured to know that you are keeping an eye on her efforts."
96,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SYLPHIE_000_060","The guildmaster is right: we need to learn more about Gatty herself."
97,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SYLPHIE_000_061","I mean, how can a little girl like her have the kind of power that attracts voidsent...? Well, first things first, I'll need to find where she lives. And then hopefully she and her mother will be willing to talk to us."
98,"TEXT_JOBWHM630_02415_SYLPHIE_000_062","Do you think we'll be facing more fiends before this is all over? I should probably be practicing my spells..."
