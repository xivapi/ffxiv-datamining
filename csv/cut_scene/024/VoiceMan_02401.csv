11,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02401_300130_LOUISOIX","Desperate for salvation, the dragons prayed to one of the first brood─to their ancestor Bahamut. Infused by the power of their fervent supplications, Bahamut arose from the abyss of death and took wing as the Meracydians' newborn god."

61,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02401_500120_ALPHINAUD","'Twould also explain why Eorzea was so terribly warped. Even as the land sought to restore itself, the returning flow of aether was cut off."
