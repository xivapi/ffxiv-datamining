0,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_000010_EDMONT","To the northern reaches of the Sea of Clouds,
where countless isles yet remained uncharted..."
1,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_000020_EDMONT","In search of a mysterious land known as Azys Lla,
and the unmasked villain who sought to claim its secrets..."
2,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_000030_EDMONT","Oblivious to the new threat which followed in their wake, they came..."
3,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_100010_HYDAELYN","Warrior...Light. Beloved..."
4,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_100020_HYDAELYN","...Hydaelyn. All made..."

7,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200010_IGEYOHRM","So falls the Lord of Mists, as did all others before him."
8,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200020_IGEYOHRM","How many times does this make, Warrior of Light? Ahhh, how much you have grown─far beyond the limits of mere mortals."
9,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200030_THORDAN","<If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> has what we seek?"
10,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200040_IGEYOHRM","That <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> does. The key to Azys Lla and the secrets of Allag."
11,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200050_IGEYOHRM","I see you have regained the blessing of Light─albeit at a fraction of its former strength."
12,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200060_THORDAN","My thanks to you, Ascian─and to you as well, Warrior of Light, for saving us the effort of slaying Bismarck."
13,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200070_THORDAN","Now that the key is within our grasp, the path to the heavens shall at last be laid bare!"
14,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200080_THORDAN","Hahaha... Ahahahahaha!"
15,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_200090_THORDAN","By our deeds shall the wrongs of antiquity be righted, and man reclaim the reins of history!"
16,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300010_ALPHINAUD","Wait. Something is amiss..."
17,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300020_ALPHINAUD","Imperial troops─and they have already secured the area."
18,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300030_REGULA","Reveal yourselves at once!"
19,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300040_REGULA","And there I was expecting more beastmen. Who are you!?"
20,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300050_VARIS","I thought Ishgardians responsible for the disappearance of our scouts, but I see now that I was mistaken."
21,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300060_VARIS","Just as Roaille observed. The Warrior of Light is wont to appear at the most inopportune times."
22,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300070_REGULA","The Warrior of Light? <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> who bested van Baelsar!?"
23,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300080_VARIS","It would seem that the famous hero of Eorzea seeks Azys Lla as well."
24,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300090_VARIS","Hardly unexpected. The secrets of the Allagans' power to bind eikons to their will could scarcely fail to interest the Scions of the Seventh Dawn..."
25,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300100_VARIS","You know as well as we what will ensue should these insatiable creatures be allowed to roam free─that their very existence threatens the life of this star. We but disagree on the solution to the problem."
26,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300110_ALPHINAUD","Genocide has ever been the Empire's favored recourse─and that is why we will continue to oppose your every attempt to claim Eorzea!"
27,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300120_VARIS","You do not hesitate to speak your mind...even when your every word could be your last."
28,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300130_VARIS","Alas, your sentiments betray the narrowness of your view. The fate of Eorzea and its inhabitants is of little concern next to the fate of the world."
29,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300140_VARIS","'Tis my solemn charge as emperor to bring the eikons to heel. If this requires the extermination of certain elements, then so be it."
30,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300150_ALPHINAUD","No, don't! They are not his thralls!"
31,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300160_REGULA","Where did that come from!?"
32,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300170_LUCIA","Take cover!"
33,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300180_REGULA","Your Radiance, we must withdraw!"
34,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300190_VARIS","We shall meet again, Warrior of Light. On that you have my word."
35,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_300200_ALPHINAUD","So Garlemald, too, has designs on Azys Lla... But why would the Emperor himself elect to lead the expedition?"
36,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400010_LUCIA","I did not think that I would ever have occasion to pilot a suit of magitek armor again─least of all under these circumstances."
37,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400020_LUCIA","My full name is Lucia goe Junius, and I was born a citizen of Garlemald."
38,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400030_CID","Ah, that explains it! When we first met in Ishgard, I very nearly called you Livia."
39,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400040_ALPHINAUD","Livia...? Livia sas Junius? The tribunus who served under Gaius van Baelsar!?"
40,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400050_LUCIA","Aye, she was my sister─though we spent little time together. After our parents were killed in an uprising, we were sent to live in different households, setting us on separate paths..."
41,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400060_LUCIA","Livia felt at home on the battlefield and chose to become a soldier, while I underwent training to become a spy."
42,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400070_ALPHINAUD","Then...Ishgard was...?"
43,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400080_LUCIA","My mission. 'Twas believed that Allagan relics of great worth were stored in the Vault, and I was sent to investigate."
44,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400090_LUCIA","Though I was given little information at the time, I now suspect I was searching for the key we but recently lost. And then I met Ser Aymeric."
45,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400100_LUCIA","'Twas his usefulness to my mission which prompted me to approach him, but I soon found myself drawn to him for other reasons."
46,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400110_LUCIA","He too was a prisoner of his past─judged for his heritage as a bastard son of the archbishop. Yet unlike my sister and I, he did not curse his fate. He simply rose above it."
47,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400120_LUCIA","In time, I came to realize that I had found a man worth following, and a new home besides. And when I subsequently confessed all to Ser Aymeric, he was good enough to accept me into his service."
48,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400130_ALPHINAUD","...I do not question your loyalty to Ser Aymeric. 'Tis your loyalty to your sister which concerns me."
49,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400140_LUCIA","I have long been of the opinion that those who dwell in the past risk losing sight of their future."
50,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400150_LUCIA","My sister fought for her convictions, and for those she held dear. So do I. So must we all."
51,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400160_CID","Well, I for one am happy to welcome a fellow Garlean to our merry band─especially one who can make magitek armor sing!"
52,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400170_BIGGS","Chief, we should be getting close."
53,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400180_WEDGE","Once we break through those clouds, we'll be right where the light was pointing─right where Azys Lla should be!"
54,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400190_CID","Hold on, everyone!"
55,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500010_CID","Look! I think that's it!"
56,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500020_BIGGS","Chief, is that...?"
57,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500030_CID","Allagan, aye. There's no mistaking their handiwork."
58,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500040_ALPHINAUD","What was that!?"
59,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500050_CID","Some sort of barrier!?"
60,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500060_WEDGE","She won't hold, Chief! She's breaking up!"
61,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500070_BIGGS","I've lost the auxiliary propeller!"
62,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500080_ALPHINAUD","Cid, it's no use! We must return to Ishgard and find another way!"
63,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500090_CID","Damn it all! Why do the Allagans always have to make everything so bloody complicated!?"
