45,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000460_ALPHINAUD","The work is its own reward, General. I must say, however, that Fordola's claims were not a little disturbing. What manner of power could Zenos have acquired that might equal an eikon?"

47,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000480_ALPHINAUD","Very possibly. The Empire's fondness for comparable Allagan technologies is exceedingly well documented. Have we made any progress with our own investigation?"

52,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000530_ALPHINAUD","Thancred told us only that Fordola had undergone some...manner of treatment..."
53,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000540_KRILE","Yes... It is a place wholly dedicated to the creation of enhanced beings whom they refer to as “the Resonant.” As I understand it, the process aims to
imbue a test subject with the qualities of an individual with demonstrated
magical aptitude.
This entails... This entails the m-mechanical extraction and transfusion of some manner of...primordial essence."
54,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000550_LYSE","So that's how Fordola improved so fast. I knew there had to be something.

58,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000590_URIANGER","In calling upon Lady Alisaie after her defeat, I was most intrigued to learn of the apparent effortlessness with which Fordola countered her attacks. 'Twas as if she knew the blade's destination ere its journey began."
59,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000600_URIANGER","A most impressive feat under any circumstances, but an almost miraculous
one when considered in the context of Fordola's unfamiliarity with my
lady's arts. How then could she so perfectly predict an unknown opponent's
every move?"
60,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000610_URIANGER","After much deliberation, I surmised that Fordola may be possessed of a preternatural ability to divine meaning from the fluctuations of an individual's aether, and to instinctively react. To employ a metaphor, one might say that she was attuned to the whispers of my lady Alisaie's soul."
61,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000620_ALPHINAUD","Wait! Have you not just described a manifestation of the Echo?"
62,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000630_URIANGER","I had no conclusive proof. The available anecdotal evidence suggested only that Fordola was uncommonly sensitive to aetheric fluctuations, and 'twas this which led me to develop my stratagem."
63,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000640_URIANGER","I would fashion a device with the capacity to generate a massive disruption
in the surrounding aether. If, as I suspected, Fordola's senses were
indeed questing for the most minor of oscillations, the shock of exposure
to a more amplitudinous aetheric waveform would be akin to a debilitating
bout of aether sickness."
64,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000650_ALPHINAUD","How...ingenious. I note that the success of your plan hinged on your device's wielder remaining ignorant of its purpose, lest Fordola divine your intent."
65,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000660_URIANGER","Indeed so, Master Alphinaud.
All things considered, 'twas a most fortuitous outcome."
66,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04006_000670_KRILE","That's putting it mildly. In any event, if Urianger is correct, that would mean these Resonant have been granted the power of the Echo via artificial means. A sobering thought to say the least─and one which makes me wonder what else Zenos has in store."
