2,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000030_RAUBAHN","Not that I understand half of it. When the Scions spoke of other worlds, I'd struggle to describe what I pictured."

9,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000100_SHADOWHUNTER","As you are doubtless aware, Ser Estinien and I cooperated to rid the world of Black Rose in your absence."
10,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000110_SHADOWHUNTER","Our journey together took us as far as the imperial palace, where we witnessed Emperor Varis meet his death at Zenos's hand."
11,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000120_SHADOWHUNTER","Being the sole witnesses to this crime, and in no position to defend our innocence, we were then forced to flee, each pursuing his own avenue of escape."
12,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000130_SHADOWHUNTER","When we were later reunited, Estinien claimed to have encountered an unfamiliar kind of machina during his flight. But to me, his description seemed anything but. And upon further investigation, I found that I was right."

14,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000150_KRILE","What? That Allagan monstrosity? Created to vanquish primals? ...With which you yourself once thought to conquer Eorzea?"
15,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000160_SHADOWHUNTER","The same. In my foolishness, I sought to harness its power─and became the Ascians' pawn in so doing."

17,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000170_SHADOWHUNTER","The Weapon itself, excavated from beneath this very city, was destroyed ere we could fully unravel its secrets. And that should have been the end of it."
18,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000180_SHADOWHUNTER","But, unlikely as it sounds, the Empire's efforts to recreate it have somehow borne fruit─primarily through secret research conducted by the VIIth Imperial Legion, it would seem."

20,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000200_SHADOWHUNTER","Indeed, few survived. The VIIth as it is now has little in common with the legion led by van Darnus, and its leadership has changed hands several times since."

38,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000380_YSHTOLA","With the Emperor slain and Zenos returned, it is impossible to predict how matters will unfold in Garlemald. The Ultima Weapon may be but the first of many unpleasant surprises."

42,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000420_BEQLUGG","We set out to create a crystalline container retaining the more useful properties of white auracite, but without its regrettable limitations. And after a good deal of trial and error, we made one."
43,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000430_BEQLUGG","An ark for soul and mind both, that will allow your incorporeal self in its entirety to be ferried between worlds... A “spirit vessel,” if you will."

46,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000460_URIANGER","Though the vessel is possessed of the requisite qualities to hold mind and memory, it wanteth yet for a means to <Emphasis>receive</Emphasis> of them. For that, we must needs imbue it with the Exarch's innate gift."
47,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000470_YSHTOLA","A gift that lives on only through the blood of the Allagan emperors...which certainly does not flow within auracite, or any other crystal."
48,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000480_URIANGER","Just so, milady. The blood serveth as a conduit of sorts─in its absence, memory cannot pass from mind unto mind, nor from flesh unto crystal."
49,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000490_MYSTERYVOICE","That being the case, we must either alter the process of inheritance so as to require no such thing, or determine a means by which my blood may permeate the vessel."
50,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000500_MYSTERYVOICE","I am hopeful that the records found within this tower will yield the knowledge we require to pursue one or the other of these avenues."
51,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000510_BEQLUGG","As well you should be! The Allagans' body of aetherological research is extraordinary. I can scarce believe it the work of ages past."
52,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000520_BEQLUGG","But its underlying principles are not so very different from those of my own field of study. Given time, we will find the answers we seek."
53,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000530_MYSTERYVOICE","I know that you can ill afford to wait, and it pains me that I must ask you to do so. I can only reaffirm my promise to you that a solution will be found."

60,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000600_ALPHINAUD","Perhaps I might accompany you? Though I am woefully ill-qualified to assist in the Exarch's research, I may yet be of some use to Lyna."

75,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05200_000750_LYNA","The Exarch told me the truth of Ardbert and his comrades' deeds, and I am aware they played some part in your own triumph. But to most, they are synonymous with the calamity that befell this world."
