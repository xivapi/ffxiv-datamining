7,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05100_000080_KRILE","I summoned you after detecting faint signs of instability in Thancred's corporeal aether. But subsequent examinations suggested all five might be affected. And when I examined them just now, my fears were confirmed."

9,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05100_000100_KRILE","Thancred exhibits the most notable signs, followed by Y'shtola and Urianger. The twins' aether, meanwhile, remains relatively stable, but there is a change there too if one knows to look for it."

59,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_05100_000560_ALISAIE","But vague notions of ownership seem a rather tenuous thing to stake our lives on. So much as a moment of doubt on <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> part, and we'd be left floating in the rift."
