2,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03100_000030_AYMERIC","With my father's passing, the seat of the archbishop lies vacant. And so, in accordance with canon law, I have assumed his responsibilities."
3,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03100_000040_AYMERIC","I should stress that this is a temporary measure. It was never intended that the lord commander of the Temple Knights serve in this capacity indefinitely."
4,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_03100_000050_AYMERIC","Quite the opposite. The statutes specify that I should surrender my powers as soon as a conclave of the senior clergy and the High Houses have named a new archbishop."

I, for example, can converse with beings of every shape and size─excepting beasts, contrary to what others would have you believe. Language has nothing to do with it, of course; rather, I am sensitive to the whispers of the soul.
