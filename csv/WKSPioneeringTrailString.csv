1,"Log 1","A Stellar Beginning","These are the faithful records of our cosmic exploration as memorialized by myself, the humble Reportingway.

Our fearless leader Searchingway's ambitious project has begun! The Moongate Hub, base of our interstellar operations, is but newly constructed, and as such our facilities are skeleton in nature, from the hangars that house our machinery (perhaps one day advanced enough to propel us into the great unknown!) to the stores which offer our workers the materials they need for their projects.

Indeed, our greatest concern at present is the small meteor showers that occasionally pepper our tents on Sinus Ardorum... Quality of fabric notwithstanding, one cannot imagine achieving our goals huddled beneath such fragile infrastructure!

It will be the work of our talented friends from Etheirys that sees our plans to fruition. May these long-lived dreams prosper!"
2,"Log 2","Base Camp Beta","Our prayers have been answered by the steady stream of personnel from Etheirys, be they Labyrinthos experts or scholars of the Studium. Not to mention the cohort of esteemed gleaners, adventurers, and artisans─a more diverse populace I have never seen!

It is thanks to everyone's diligence that we have been able to transform our modest Moongate Hub into something more established. A Base Camp Beta, if you will. Gone are our feeble tents, replaced by sturdy metal roofing! We need not fear the occasional meteorite as once we did.

With ample talent at our disposal, we have taken our inaugural steps with no little pride or success. I wait with bated breath to witness how our endeavors unfold outside the Moongate Hub."
3,"Log 3","The Cosmoliner","One may think it strange that we Loporrits are now endeavoring to “explore” the moon upon which we have resided for so long. Yet the facilities we create here serve not only as a mooring point for our interstellar aspirations, but a testing site for the challenges we may face on foreign stars.

In this sense, our successful construction of the Cosmoliner may prove to be our most instrumental boon. As we cannot yet confirm the presence of stable aetheric confluences on distant stars, we must have an alternative means of transportation at our disposal. The Cosmoliner provides us with just that, and hopefully we will witness the day when it spans the entirety of Sinus Ardorum."
4,"Log 4","Peaceful Living and Technological Leaps","A habitation module and cosmoport have been successfully constructed by the hands of Etheirys! The relative modesty of these facilities bespeaks the enhancements we hope to make someday.

For our habitation module, we incorporated feedback we received from Smileton in order to create an authentically safe and enjoyable environment within which to live. I repeat: you need not fear unwanted exhilaration whilst residing in this humble abode.

As for the cosmoport, it is a triumph of Sharlayan's latest technology. Apparently, there exist faint confluences of aether within space, to which the cosmoport will guide any starfaring vessel, and whilst this model is still primitive, it carries us one step further towards interstellar travel! How marvelous!"
5,"Log 5","A (Better) Home for Mechs","The mechs you see and use in Sinus Ardorum are the fruits of both Loporrit and Etheirys labor, painstakingly crafted to suit whatever needs lie within the vast abyss we one day shall traverse.

However, the tents we housed our precious mechs within did little to prevent dust and detritus from jamming joints and eliciting errors. But no longer! No, our newly renovated mech hangars now prevent environmental harm to their precious cargo. I hear that even further improvements might yet be made, but for now our mech ops should proceed even smoother thanks to our latest infrastructure!"
6,"Log 6","The Cosmoliner: Northwestern Radius","Travel to Calabash Cove has never been easier with our new extension to the Cosmoliner!

Our personnel will be pleased to hear that rest areas and charging ports are fully installed at each waypoint to better facilitate cosmic exploration in the northwestern radius. By all means, take a trip for yourself to enjoy the conveniences of our newly improved Cosmoliner!"
7,"Log 7","The Cosmoliner: Southeastern Radius","Weddingway's Bower is but a few stops away on our newly improved Cosmoliner!

For those yet unaware, this area is integral to studies in soil quality and our efforts to imbue the moon's unforgiving surface with nutrients. Weddingway is our Loporrit in charge of this endeavor, and together with Sharlayan agriculturalists they have been experimenting with myriad fungi and flora. As rumor holds, fungi-enthusiast Lovingway visits quite often...which may explain why one is far more likely to find mushrooms than flowers blooming in the Bower."
8,"Log 8","Piercingway Tunnel","As they are wont to say on Etheirys: “'Tisn't a mountain high enough to keep me from piercing through!”

Carved into the hard crystal and soft stone of Gleamslope, Piercingway Tunnel stands as tangible proof of our technological prowess. Together with our Sharlayan compatriots, we developed a new type of tunneling shield that allowed us to dig our way through without incident!

Now more than ever I believe that no matter what awaits us on foreign stars, we shall be able to overcome any obstacle!"
9,"Log 9","The Cosmoliner: Southwestern Radius","I am pleased to report that the Cosmoliner now extends through Piercingway Tunnel!

Not only do rare ores allegedly exist within Gleamslope, but it is said that ancient Allagan remains─which seem to have dropped from the heavens─were also discovered. Put to the right use, these new resources will prove vital to the future of cosmic exploration, or I have not two ears and a fluffy tail!"
10,"Log 10","Base Camp Gamma","How does one describe this burgeoning city that is unfolding before our very eyes? Our Moongate Hub has grown yet again!

Fit to be dubbed Base Camp Gamma, our new headquarters boasts roads, walls, and plumbing that unify our disparate resources. Better living conditions and the installation of supply stations are but a few notable improvements that will help all our workers on a daily basis.

However, we mustn't rest upon our laurels─there is much and more we might yet accomplish for the Moongate Hub!"
11,"Log 11","Energetic Hydration","By the sweat of everyone's noble brows, our energy and water supplies have been amplified!

The energization station is capable of producing immense amounts of energy, crucial for powering any starfaring vessel. Additionally, our hydrofication station is brimming with drinking water sourced from aetherochemical effluents and purified by rainbow crystals.

Energy and hydration─the very keys to survival both snugly within our grasp!"
12,"Log 12","Cosmoport and Hangars Complete!","Our cosmoport and mech hangars have been polished and improved to perfection!

Each facility is connected to our energization station, which provides the perfect environment for mechs and starships alike. We of course have smaller generators on hand in case of error or emergencies, however─one must always hope for the best yet prepare for the worst!"
13,"Log 13","Nadir Lift","Far in the northeast radius, the nadir lift has been completed!

We first discovered this area via drone and decided to model our engagement based on how we might investigate a foreign star. After securing safe passage, we proceeded with mining and constructing this gigantic lift using the knowledge we gained from building Piercingway Tunnel. I think it safe to say that the nadir lift is more than just a triumph of technological prowess, but a symbol of all the progress we have made in Sinus Ardorum.

To wit, the lunar nadir is the final area into which we had yet to venture! Even so, our sights are set ever further─let us press onward with cosmic exploration!"
14,"Log 14","The Cosmoliner: Nadir Lift","The Cosmoliner now extends to the nadir lift, officially completing its full circuit of Sinus Ardorum! Difficult though construction was, travel to those close caves filled with fungi and aetherial falls is now easier than ever.

What progress we have made! Our efforts here are sure to bear fruit when we one day travel to foreign stars."
15,"Log 15","Lunar Hopopolis","A small moon rises upon the greater moon we stand upon─to wit, our Moongate Hub has evolved into a Lunar Hopopolis!

Beneath its domed roof, a gathering of adventurous souls bustle about, eager to leap even further afield. Our rainbow crystals no longer suffer the indignity of being struck by meteorites, and the atmosphere is one of both exhilaration and belonging. How one can feel so at home whilst in the midst of rigorous research may seem bizarre, yet we have realized such a space and more both in our evolved headquarters and our efforts in Sinus Ardorum.

We never could have made it thus far without the help of all our fastidious workers. This is your triumph, dear reader!"
16,"Log 16","To Eternity and Beyond","Our facilities are complete and upon our cosmoport stands a new starship begging to be piloted. This chapter, my friends, marks the crowning achievement of our lunar development initiative!

For me, these days have passed in the haze of a dream, but thanks to our fearless leader Searchingway and all our wonderful contributors from Etheirys, gazing into the velvety black sky reflects to me something...profound. The arduous work of transcription becomes but a trifle, and my exhaustion fades quietly into the calm.

Henceforth, our efforts will be focused anew, to distant exploration! Insofar as our dreams persist and my exotablet remains charged, I will ever remain your faithful scribe. To adventures both old and new─to eternity and beyond!"
17,"Log 1","Phaenna Beckons","It is with great trepidation that I, the humble Reportingway, record the next momentous hop of our endeavor. I trust my words prove a worthy substitute for the excitement of cosmic exploration itself!

Having departed Sinus Ardorum aboard the <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis>, we now find ourselves on the glassy wonder that is Phaenna. With its abundance of silicon and tantalizingly unique environment, we had little choice but to select this planet as our first destination!

Thanks to the steadfast efforts of our advance party and the base-building techniques we pioneered on the moon, Glassblowers' Beacon already bristles with activity. Of course, we will need plenty more resource shipments before it truly blossoms, but with such committed contributors propelling the initiative forward, the future of the base and our goals beyond is bright indeed!"
18,"Log 2","A Growing Glassblowers' Beacon","With the <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis> constantly shuttling supplies from Sinus Ardorum, and our ever-dependable contributors striving nigh without cease, Glassblowers' Beacon has certainly begun to shine!

Perhaps one of the most striking features of our glorious base is its location: nestled within an extensive cave system providing shelter from the shard showers that rain down upon Phaenna.

That being said, the cave does not guarantee complete protection. Indeed, the rocky canopy is riven with yawning gaps that let in light, but also the aforementioned environmental hazards. Thankfully, our engineers are busy crafting a solution─abuzz with excitement as they devise a plan for expansion in harmony with the surrounding terrain!"
19,"Log 3","New Frontiers for the Cosmoliner","Work has begun to bring that triumph of lunar locomotion, the Cosmoliner, to the crystalline expanses of Phaenna!

The technology was conceived as a reliable mode of transport on distant stars without stable aetheric confluences, and this new frontier represents the Cosmoliner's first concrete test.

I understand that our research and engineering crews in particular await this development with bated breath. Unlike our adventurer cohort─who are used to traipsing across adverse terrain both stellar and terrestrial─our scholarly colleagues favor the convenience of a fully functioning transportation network!

If all proceeds according to plan, we shall soon be zipping and zooming around the immediate environs of Glassblowers' Beacon."
20,"Log 4","For Happier Inhabitants","Phaenna now has its very own habitation module! Compared with accommodations in Sinus Ardorum, these facilities feature more expansive communal areas, and have been designed with the utmost comfort in mind. In fact, from the very outset, no effort has been spared to ensure the well-being of our Etheirys-born contributors on their interstellar sojourn.

On this occasion, we sought the opinions of our researchers and engineers regarding their prospective dwellings. The respondents─mostly quartered in makeshift tents at the time─insisted they would be happy so long as they had a decent place to sleep. Interpreting this as a yearning for living space free from unnecessary accoutrements, we ultimately decided to implement a dimensionally reduced design, specially tailored to contributors' preferences!"
21,"Log 5","An Ode to Infrastructure","Let the water flow and the power surge, for Phaenna is now replete with energization and hydrofication stations!

Much like the rest of the star, Phaenna's water sources are incredibly rich in silicon─a fact which, while fascinating, does not entail ready potability. Fortunately for the initiative, the hydrofication process removes all impurities, leaving nothing but life-sustaining water. Of course, without sufficient power, the hydrofication station would struggle to hydroficate, but with the energization station taking care of our energy needs, we have nothing to fear on that front!

With these two vital pillars of infrastructure in place, our exploration can proceed apace!"
22,"Log 6","A Place to Rest One's Weary Mech","Our arsenal of mechs continues to prove indispensable here on Phaenna. Indeed, multiple mechs are a must for the ever-expanding initiative, as this insures projects can continue unabated, even when dastardly technical issues strike!

When determining where to house such an integral arm of our operation, we had to address a number of logistical concerns, ultimately opting for the present location: centrally positioned, and well protected from the elements.

We have high hopes this facility─perfectly optimized for the star─proves a boon to the safety and stability of our mechanized workforce!"
23,"Log 7","The Fragile Float","The Cosmoliner now extends ever further, joining together the western and southern banks of the Soda-lime Float!

This was no easy feat, however. Initiative researchers theorize that these valleys were carved out by erosion from the liquid glass. As such, the uneven terrain complicated the flow of supplies and workers to the sites in question.

We had initially planned to lay Cosmoliner rail with all due haste, but soon realized that the region's fragile surfaces would doubtless buckle under the weight of our facilities. Thus, we deemed it prudent to regroup and seek out stable construction sites before commencing the work in earnest.

To wit, we owe the success of this endeavor to our provident engineers and surveyors!"
24,"Log 8","Of Chasm and Crane","Capsule Chasm is as a gaping maw upon Phaenna's surface, where “waterfalls” from the Soda-lime Float tumble from its cliffs. Layers of enormous, colorful clusters piled atop each other over the ages, forming the chasm floor as we now know it. Having been isolated from the rest of the star for so long, we were all but certain a plethora of new discoveries awaited us there!

The Appliqué Crane would be our key to unlocking these myriad mysteries. By melding its segments onto sturdy surfaces at the chasm's edges─not unlike a clay appliqué placed onto a work of glass─we could safely descend the cliffs on a path of our own making.

Though we faced many a challenge during the descent, our wealth of construction experience from Sinus Ardorum remains an invaluable asset to our success here in Phaenna!"
25,"Log 9","Cosmoliners in the Chasm","Our dream of Cosmoliner stations at the base of Capsule Chasm is now a breathtaking reality!

Of course, manifesting this vision was not without its own challenges. Cluster-laden cliffs and terrain barred our Cosmoliner's paths, making precise coordination between applicable stations─a vital step in this process─much thornier than usual. As we've gleaned from our previous projects, building Cosmoliner stations on glass ground is less than ideal!

But once again, our trials and tribulations in Sinus Ardorum have taught us how to efficiently handle such conundrums! By redoubling our efforts on locating areas where glass and sediment levels were well-balanced, we succeeded in pinpointing stable locations to connect and build each station. I cannot help but beam with pride at the once-insurmountable challenges our initiative can now overcome!"
26,"Log 10","Our Shining Beacon","My heart swells as I watch Glassblowers' Beacon grow from a place of necessity to one of comfort... Our base is the embodiment of the initiative's unwavering determination, and I, for one, am eternally grateful for it.

But what makes a base “comfortable,” one might ask? This humble writer attributes it to the Beacon's flawlessly placed facilities, each and every one purposely positioned to snugly fit the natural formations within the cave. We couldn't simply build in a tidy little line and call it a day─heavens, no! There was much to consider during construction, from building accessible paths for our mechs to traverse, to wiring and storage for our supplies! I've been privy to countless complaints from our engineers who pioneered this project, and though they may grumble, I am not blind to the glint of satisfaction in their eyes as they recount their struggles and successes.

One day, we shall expand the initiative to other stars from this very base...though I suspect that glorious occasion is still quite a ways off. For the present, we must endeavor to grow, and never forget how far we've come!"
27,"Log 11","Upgrading the Hangar","The naturally occurring glass on Phaenna is a most formidable material! While it is, of course, aesthetically pleasing, its durability is nigh unmatched, functioning as an efficient agent for solar energy conversion as well. With it, we've begun plating walls at the base and modified our mech hangar all the while!

'Twould be remiss of me not to note the brilliant collaboration between glasswork specialists from Etheirys and our very own engineers─without whom many of our projects would have proven impossible! But the fruits of their labor are astounding, and we've drastically improved our methods of conserving solar power as a result!"
28,"Log 12","The Cosmoport Overhaul","It is my great pleasure to note that we've expanded cosmoport functions...and with it, our aspirations!

Round trips to Sinus Ardorum should no longer pose an issue─and we may potentially set our sights even further into the cosmos when the initiative demands it! Our new and specialized energization stations have significantly reduced our vehicles' charging times as well, enabling the efficient and expedient flow of supplies to those who require them!

Now, launching and landing from a cave may sound like a hazardous undertaking...and indeed it would be, under normal circumstances! However, I'm told our engineers are hard at work programming detailed takeoff and landing routes for a risk-free automatic piloting system! Reminded of the potential perils involved in manning a starfaring vessel, I am compelled to reflect upon Cruisingway's first landing in Phaenna─her proficiency as a pilot cannot be understated!"
29,"Log 13","Mega Panels for Megapower","What fuels our aspirations here in Glassblowers' Beacon? Why, two great megapower panels!

The aether conversions of our energization station have been instrumental, of course, but our brand-new panels can efficiently condense light from Phaenna's sun into just the sort of energy we need to power our base.

If you stop to count, we have ever so many things that require power here─mechs trundling near and far, facilities that keep us housed and watered. Having more than enough energy is just enough energy, in the humble opinion of this writer. At the very least, I no longer need to fret about my tablet flickering out mid-sentence!"
30,"Log 14","Chilling-a-Way the Heat","We have successfully and strategically overcome one of the more punishing environmental challenges here on Phaenna─to wit, the molten glass of Fusingway Vent.

This star is possessed of a volatile geothermal signature known to create volcanic craters even in the most unlikely areas. Fusingway Vent is one such example, and it was here that the highly ambitious and experimental Operation Chilling-a-Way was executed. Thanks to our brave contributors (and a mobilization station full of coolant-toting drones), we managed to ethically freeze safe passage across the flows of molten glass.

Once an angry red, the glass in question has hardened to a beautiful pale blue, not unlike the color of the Soda-lime Float. As our drones can now tend to any further chilling we require, our explorers are free to survey the unique and perplexing environment of Fusingway Vent without the threat of burnt toes or singed tails. I, for one, am eager to know what they discover about the fundamental workings of this fascinating planet!"
31,"Log 15","The Cosmoliner: Ventpipe Filigree","The Cosmoliner has been safely extended into Fusingway Vent, completing the full circuit of our transport and providing easy access to every corner of Phaenna!

We deployed the drones from Operation Chilling-a-Way to ensure the ground was fully solidified before beginning construction. Rest assured that the Ventpipe Filigree will carry you safely through the volcanic crater without dropping you into piping hot glass!

Our Cosmoliner may seem humble compared to our contributors' many modes of travel, but it is a triumph born of our engineers' skill and ingenuity. With no little pride do I encourage all our explorers to make use of this convenient and exhilarating public transportation!"
32,"Log 16","Phaenna Stellascope","Feast your eyes upon the ultimate addition to Glassblowers' Beacon: an astrological telescope made from Phaenna's unique glass!

The Phaenna Stellascope is capable not only of enhancing images of faraway stars, but also estimating the density of celestial currents surrounding them. As the initiative's primary goals are to discover intelligent life and alien civilizations, our astronomers are already hard at work analyzing the findings of our truly gargantuan telescope!

With construction completed, we have achieved all that we intended to develop upon this star. We owe all our accomplishments to the many contributors, specialists, and researchers that have worked tirelessly to see our dreams fulfilled. On behalf of the entire initiative, I extend to you my most profound thanks!"
33,"Log 17","Beholding the Heavens","The <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis> sits upon the cosmoport, awaiting the discovery of another eligible star. That her maiden voyage brought us here, to this planet of glass, feels like nothing less than providence. After all, it was by Phaenna's particular boons that we were able to polish and refine the grand lens of our telescope, a curious eye seeking bounties anew.

Regardless of where our next leap lands, I can say with certainty that our band of merry dreamers has proven its mettle as an initiative of indefatigable explorers. And yet, our journey leads on. This step outside Etheirys's star system necessitates another, and until the day of our next departure, we shall keep our gaze fixed upon the heavens."
