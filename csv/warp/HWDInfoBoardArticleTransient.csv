And though this is by any measure a remarkable feat, we have not simply rebuilt structures. We have rebuilt lives. And beside the honor of working with such a gathering of fine folk, this is what fills me with the greatest pride.

We could not have accomplished this without the tireless efforts of all involved. No words will suffice to express my gratitude, but I wish to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Till fate next sees fit to bring us together again, I wish you every success.

To mark this most momentous of occasions, and to bid welcome to visitors from lands near and far to our new home, we are presently hosting a festival─the Skyrise Celebration.

Chief among the amusements at the festival are diverting games known as fêtes, and attractive prizes await those who participate. We hope that you will find a moment to join us in the revelry.
