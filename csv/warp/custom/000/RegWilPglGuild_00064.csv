1,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_A1_000_1","Tell me about yourself."
3,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_A1_000_2","What is a pugilist?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_010","<gasp> You mean to say you do not know Hamon Holyfist, the man who once ruled the bloodsands!?
...Hmmm, mayhap it was before your time."
6,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_011","Aye, I used to be champion of the Coliseum, but these days I train young hopefuls as master of the Pugilists' Guild. If you're interested in learning hand-to-hand combat, you're welcome to sign up."
7,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_012","And if you're a scantily clad maiden, then you're <Emphasis>especially</Emphasis> welcome! Hah hah hah!"
8,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_020","A pugilist is an expert in hand-to-hand combat. Through rigorous training, he forges devastating weapons of his limbs."
9,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_021","Having said that, fists and feet don't deal near as much damage as a blade. But what does that matter when you can land several blows for each swing of the sword?"
10,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_022","Aye, what a pugilist lacks in destructive force, he makes up for in speed and cunning. Rather than trying to deal great damage with a single blow, he pummels his foe with lightning-fast combinations."
11,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_023","If you become as good as yours truly, your combinations will be so swift and seamless, folk won't be able to tell when one technique ends and another begins! Hah hah hah!"
12,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_050","Oho, if it isn't <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Ever a sight for these old eyes!"
13,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_060","Ah, if it isn't my dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Professor Erik the Long–winded tells me you've made a monk of yourself, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>."
14,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_061","You were ever one of my most inquisitive, so the news hardly came as a surprise. Needless to say I'm very proud of you! We ought to go at it a few rounds again, just like the good old days, eh?"
15,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_070","Ah, my dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Rumor has it you've gotten dragged into some unsavory business. But keep your chin up, you hear? I believe in your innocence─we all do. And those that believe otherwise will have to answer to my fists of fury! Hah hah hah!"
16,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_071","Ah, my dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! The unsavory business has been settled, so I'm told. While I'm happy for you, I was rather looking forward to knocking some villains around... Well, maybe the next time you get framed, eh? Hah hah hah!"
17,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_Q2_000_1","What will you ask?"
18,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_A2_000_1","How are things?"

20,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_A2_000_3","Nothing."
21,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_100","We've been getting a lot of young blood joining the guild of late. It's all I can do to remember their names."
22,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_101","Considering the fine job she did training you, I decided to place Chuchuto in charge of all the new recruits. As an added bonus, I've freed myself to chase after scantily clad maidens!"
23,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_102","Having said that, I must confess I haven't had any success in that arena. With my youthful vigor reclaimed, I thought that I was certain to be popular with the ladies again. Ahhh, I can't imagine what I'm doing wrong."
24,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_120","Oh, there isn't much to report on my end, but it seems you've been busy making light work of the impossible. Truly, I trained you well, hah hah hah!
...Now then, you did as I requested, I trust?"
25,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_121","What request? Why, the one I wrote on a letter for Chuchuto to pass to you, of course! While you were in Garlemald, you were to sing my praises to beautiful maidens."
26,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_122","...What? Why are you looking at me like that?"
27,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_110","And here I thought <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> was the one having trouble remembering things! Well, young'un, allow me refresh your memory─it'll serve to refresh mine as well, hah hah hah!"
