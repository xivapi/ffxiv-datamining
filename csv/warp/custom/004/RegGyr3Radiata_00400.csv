2,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_A1_000_001","Tell me about yourself."
3,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_A1_000_002","What kind of place is this?"
4,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_010","Tell you about myself...? You really are a stranger here, aren't you. Too much talk can get a person killed."
6,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_011","My father talked too much once─complained about his job. A “friend” reported him to the authorities, and then the soldiers came to take him away as a “suspected insurgent.” I never saw him again."
7,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_012","And then there was my little brother. When a group of patriots heard he was a laborer for the Empire, they strung him up from a tree.
So, no─you don't talk about yourself around here."
8,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_013","There's not much to tell. I'm Leaping Doe─I live here."
9,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_014","I could probably pack up and move somewhere else now that the imperials are gone, but I guess I've just been here too long. I've a mind to stay a while anyway, just in case my father ever comes back..."
10,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_015","Now that we don't need to live in fear every day, Radiata's not such a bad place to be."
11,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_020","Radiata? Well, this village is home to those who labor at Castrum Abania or Specula Imperatoris. Think of it as an imperial slave pen."
12,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_021","It certainly wasn't called “Radiata” by the folk who live here. It had a different name once, but you'll not hear anyone say it out loud. That earns you a visit from the correction officers."
13,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_022","You tell other villagers you're from Radiata, though, and it'll get you spit on. To everyone else, we're the Empire's “whipped curs.”"
14,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_023","We lose either way. If we're to be treated like dogs for where we were born, then we've no choice but to live like one..."
15,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_024","This village is home to those who were forced to labor at Castrum Abania or Specula Imperatoris. That's all changed now, of course."
16,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_025","The imperials have lost any hold they had here, aside from the name they gave the place. It did have another, once upon a time, but I guess everyone is too used to “Radiata” to bother switching it back."
17,"TEXT_REGGYR3RADIATA_00400_LEAPINGDOE_000_026","Hells, I don't think even a single person has left the place. Perhaps the idea of freedom hasn't sunk in yet─gotta remember what it's like to stretch your wings before you can fly away."
