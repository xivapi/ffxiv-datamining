1,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_001","As the most discerning of the Namazu, I have been tasked with overseeing the paissa competition! Notice the smoldering intensity of my stare as I shrewdly appraise you. But do not be alarmed! I am friendlier than I look, yes, yes."
2,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_100_001","Come to see the paissas, yes, yes? I'm afraid it would be terribly dull at present. Perhaps if we can find something to raise their spirits."
3,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_002","Thank you again for your help. The paissas are sure to be excited when they see what you've brought. Yes, yes."
4,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_003","Tell Seigetsu that all will be well. For now, at least. And when you are finished, I would be more than happy to show you the paissas! While taking the proper safety precautions, yes, yes."
5,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_010","The paissas seem to be in high spirits today, yes, yes. They might even be up for a match! Care to see for yourself?"

10,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_016","Though it may be best if we find a location removed from Dhoro Iloh. Yes, yes. I fear the paissas will wreak indiscriminate destruction once they get to tussling, smashing our parade floats and ripping our pavilions to ribbons! But come, come. I know just the place to unleash them safely."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_020","Here we are. The perfect venue to show off what the paissa can do. Is it not impressive? I detected it from afar with my keen gaze. Yes, yes."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_021","Naturally, I will serve as referee. Naught will escape my all-seeing eyes, no, no. Unless I blink. Which I never do."
13,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_022","...Ahem. Merely watching them come to blows wouldn't be very interesting, though, would it? Care to wager which will emerge the victor?"
14,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_023","That said, this is only an exhibition match. Do not hesitate for fear of choosing wrong─I certainly do not expect everyone to share my skill at spotting the to-be victor!"

18,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_024","An excellent choice. Yes, yes. Make sure not to lose track of who's who once their fists and fur start flying."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_025","Alright, you two. Ready... Begin!"

24,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_034","Quickly. We have to get them back to Dhoro Iloh, before they tear each other to shreds!"
25,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_035","<gasp> Can you feel that? The tension between them is palpable. You may want to stand back. Their fury can be like a typhoon, savage and unpredictable. I would hate for you to be caught between them."

28,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_041","Have you ever seen such a display of martial prowess? The Ok'Gundu Gladiator nearly delivered a killing blow, but the Rosehouse Wrestler, at the very last moment, sidestepped the punch and delivered a staggering roundhouse in return! A shame no one else was here to witness this."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_042","Have you ever seen such carnage? If not for the Rosehouse Wrestler's thick fur, the Ok'Gundu Gladiator would surely have rent the flesh from his bones. Why, the poor beast is so disoriented, he's lost all sense of direction. Unprecedented!"
30,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_043","The battle has grown so intense I can scarcely stand it! A ceaseless flurry of punches and kicks from both sides, and yet they remain unscathed. Now, they close in for the kill."
31,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_044","Never have I seen such displays of brutality. To be frank, I don't know what's gotten into them. I only pray they both survive to participate in the actual competition."
32,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_045","Would you look at that footwork! They seem to float as they circle about one another. It's a wonder either of them can land a blow at all."
33,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_050","This looks to be a turning point in the match, the outcome of which may very well depend on your support. Yes, yes."

47,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_080","So, what did you think? Did it set your whiskers to tingling? Ah, of course not. You have no whiskers. Still, I hope you enjoyed this little exhibition all the same."
48,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_081","Now, let us return to Dhoro Iloh. They need time for their wounds and minds to recover from the trauma of today's match."
49,"TEXT_REGOTH3GYOKA_00482_GYOKA_000_090","Of course, I understand. A fight between paissas is not for the squeamish. No, no. If you should change your mind, however, you are welcome to see them any time."
