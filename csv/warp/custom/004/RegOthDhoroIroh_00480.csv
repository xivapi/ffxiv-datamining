1,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_A1_000_001","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_A1_000_002","What kind of place is this?"
4,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_001","If you must know, I serve as... <sigh> Seigetsu's apprentice. A position I apparently agreed to after one too many cups of tea."
6,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_002","A terrible vice, but who can resist the allure of freshly brewed tea with a slice of lemon? Not I. No, no."
7,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_010","An excellent question. Yes, yes. A question whose answer begins with a dream─Gyoshin's dream, actually. His greatest grandsire revealed that we must hold a seven-year celebration every seven hundred and seventy-seven years, lest we face complete and utter annihilation."
8,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_011","In our search for a venue, we beseeched the khatun of the Mol for aid. Much to our surprise, she had already granted us leave to use this land, the former home of the Dhoro."
9,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_020","We have only recently finished repairing the pavilions so there is still much to do. But someday soon, the grand festival will begin. And if the fates are kind, I will have cause to take a seven-year leave of absence."
10,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_030","I must confess, I was initially opposed to the idea of a festival. A seven-year-long festival. But with our ceremonial altar complete and festivities finally underway, I cannot deny that I have been enjoying myself."
11,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_040","The festival is well underway, and we have even built a float. If you have not seen it, I'm sure you have at least <Emphasis>heard</Emphasis> it. Yes, yes. The others carry it about to and fro, chanting day and night, night and day. Even in my sleep I hear it... The ceaseless chanting..."
12,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_050","Word has it we have you to thank for some of our newer events borrowed from the Xaela, is that right? Horse racing, Azim Bökh, and the archery competition. Quite fun, yes, yes, but also very challenging."
13,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_051","As you might imagine, our short stature and still even shorter appendages are not well suited to these activities."
14,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_060","The crowning achievement of the festival so far is without question our Namazu effigy. Yes, yes. Have you ever seen anything so majestic?"
15,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_061","The flames at its feet, burning passionately with Namazu spirit. The elegant form of its whiskers, almost floating on the breeze. And its eyes... Its majesty often leaves me at a loss for words."
16,"TEXT_REGOTHDHOROIROH_00480_GYOFUKU_000_070","I never imagined in my wildest dreams we could achieve so much. Perhaps Seigetsu was right─this festival may really come to be the beginning of a civilized Namazu society."
