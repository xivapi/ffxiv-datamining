1,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_001","I've been sent by the Adventurers' Guild to oversee this year's festivities. There was to be a special surprise for the children, but I fear our plans may not come to fruition."
2,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_002","In case you were unaware, the Starlight Celebration originated in Ishgard. The climate of Coerthas may be harsh, but one cannot deny that there is joy to be had rollicking in the snow. We wished to bring that joy to the children here, ordering snow from Coerthas for the construction of snowmen."
3,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_003","The problem, however, is a number of our snowmen have vanished. Locals claim that a group of mischievous imps snuck into town in an attempt to melt them, forcing the snowmen to flee."
4,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_004","You appear perplexed, and I do not blame you. Were I in your shoes, I would also doubt my own words. But I assure you, there is a perfectly plausible explanation for why the snowmen developed sentience and acted in self-preservation."
5,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_005","You see, to prevent the snowmen from melting in warmer climates beyond the snowy fields of Coerthas, they were given special cores known as <Emphasis>eternal ice</Emphasis>. Forged from ice crystals, eternal ice functions in the same manner as a golem's heart."
6,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_006","And that, my friend, is why the snowmen came to life. If we cannot find the snowmen, at the very least we must retrieve the cores. It would take moons to forge them anew, and without them, new snowmen are out of the question."
7,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_010","I doubt they could have gotten far. If you should find them near town, please keep them safe from those diabolical imps."
8,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_011","The snowmen should be accompanied by unusually decorative treants, but no need to fear. They've been especially trained to take part in the holiday festivities, and if need be, supply the snowmen with additional snow. In the event of an emergency, they will also defend the snowmen."
9,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_012","The imps have cast some manner of fiery enchantment upon themselves, rendering them invulnerable to most attacks. Fortunately, there is a way past this. While <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> may not be able to attack them on your own, the treants can. Covered in their snow, you may stand a chance.
I must warn you, however, that the treants will not hand over their snow to strangers. I daresay you will need to suffer a pelting or two."
10,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_013","The Adventurers' Guild would be ever so grateful for any eternal ice you can retrieve. Bring any that you find to the Starlight suppliers, and they will see that you are duly compensated."
11,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_020","The Starlight Celebration can be traced back to ancient Ishgard. Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas."
12,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_021","Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms."
13,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_022","Owing to their generosity, the children survived the winter and lived to pay forward the kindness they had received. The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born."
14,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
15,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
16,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_A1_000_2","Where can I find the sentient snowmen?"
17,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_A1_000_3","What is the Starlight Celebration?"
18,"TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_A1_000_4","Nothing."
