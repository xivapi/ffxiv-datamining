3,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_012","Please, allow me to apologize on behalf of Master Ishibushi! He does not mean to be rude, he is simply brusque by nature. In fact, I am sure he is very pleased to see you at our construction site."
4,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_013","You see, like everyone else in the enclave, we too have benefited from your magnanimity."

8,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_017","We would have thanked you sooner had we not been so busy here. Even working day and night, it took an awfully long time to bring down the old tower."
9,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_018","I will say one thing for those Garleans─they certainly know how to build. We were getting nowhere with the tools we had, so we had to import ones better suited to taking apart steel structures. And explosives. Lots of explosives."
10,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_019","Now we are making swift progress on building our own tower. Isn't that right, Master?"

15,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_024","Yes, we still need to decide how to build the uppermost section."
16,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_025","Seeing as your donations are funding this endeavor, perhaps we should ask you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. What do you think should be placed at the top of the tower?"

18,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_A1_000_001","Why not give it a beacon and turn it into a lighthouse?"
19,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_A1_000_002","What this place needs is a massive statue of Lord Hien."
20,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_026","Brilliant! Why didn't I think of that?"
21,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_027","Not only will it serve to guide ships traveling at night, but the increased visibility will make it easier for the guards to keep an eye on the enclave."
22,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_028","A statue!? I think that is a little beyond our level of expertise. And I doubt that Lord Hien would be pleased by something so ostentatious."
23,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_029","Perhaps practicality should take precedence over aesthetics. I know! How about turning the watchtower into a lighthouse? That way, the port can receive merchant ships even at night!"
24,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_030","What say you, Master?"

27,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_SYSTEM_000_033","Construction of the watchtower is proceeding quickly, with plans to include a beacon so that it may also function as a lighthouse."
28,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_SYSTEM_000_034","As you continue to contribute to the Shazenkai and the reconstruction effort, in what other ways might the Doman Enclave grow and change?"
29,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_ISHIBUSHI_000_035","We will make a much better tower than the Garleans did."
30,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_ISHIBUSHI_000_040","It should be perfectly symmetrical. Down to the last brick, if possible."

36,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_049","I even saw all the way to the demesne, where the field hands are bringing in their first harvest. From now on, I shall enjoy observing the change of seasons from our lofty perch."

38,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_ISHIBUSHI_000_051","You should probably mention that we had enough materials to make a meeting hall for the builders. You will not be seeing me in there, though."
