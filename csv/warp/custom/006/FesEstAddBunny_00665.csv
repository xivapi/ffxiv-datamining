1,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_051","(-Wizened Voice-)<Emphasis>Am</Emphasis> I, Soroban? I gave my permission for you to leave the temple to go frolic about in that ridiculous rabbit suit, did I not? Mind you, I am already beginning to regret my decision. At this rate, it will be a thousand years before you are ready to succeed me!"
2,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_052","I understand this, Master Genbu. Truly, I do! I assure you that this is all part of my mission to expand my horizons and deepen my knowledge of this world, that I might one day protect the Ruby Sea as you do."
3,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_053","(-Wizened Voice-)Ohohoho! As you can see, this young one is as spirited as ever. It is good to see you in fine fettle as well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
4,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_054","Ohohoho! How long has it been since I traveled to these shores? No matter─I must find myself a great warrior, lest the Ruby Sea be bathed in the flames of destruction..."
5,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_055","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It has been some time, has it not? When I heard of your involvement in these festivities, I was compelled to come and see for myself. I was, however, burdened with an overgrown kitten who can neither swim nor fly, making the journey here troublesome indeed."
6,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_056","Had I known these suits would be so...constrictive, I may have stayed at Hells' Lid. Were I to use my powers to transform you into a snake, you might better understand my struggle."
7,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_057","...But I jest. Such ill treatment of a warrior of your stature would incur the ire of my fellow auspices."
8,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_058","Similarly, were any of them foolish enough to give you cause for consternation, my retribution against them would be swift and merciless."
9,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_059","On that fateful day, I vowed that never again would I associate with mortals. And yet, here I am..."
10,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_060","Well, well, old friend. I was not expecting to see <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> in a place like this. Do you not remember my final words to you when you left the temple?"
11,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_061","I told you that you were welcome to return anytime you wish. And yet, you spurn our invitation. I am filled with such profound loneliness, I can feel my aramitama swell with anger and rage─!"
12,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_062","...'Tis a joke, friend. Perhaps my companions would express such sentiments, but not I."
13,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_063","And yet, I cannot deny that we would welcome your company. After all, you are one of the few mortals in this world that we see as a friend."
14,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_064","Mortals are honorable creatures, indeed... I must keep my fury in check, lest I visit upon them death and destruction they do not deserve."
15,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SUZAKU_000_065","Let me tell you of a dream I had. In it, I was standing in a great manse, with countless visions of my beloved Tenzen dancing about me. It was so curious, and so deeply beautiful..."
16,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SUZAKU_000_066","I imagine that you are thinking that I haven't changed a bit. And yet, I assure you that I have come far since last we met."
17,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SUZAKU_000_067","Yes, I understand that I cannot allow myself to be consumed by the past, lest I lose sight of those precious individuals who stand beside me here in the present."
18,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SUZAKU_000_068","And yet, I have vowed to do all that I can to honor his memory, and bring happiness and good fortune to those around me, much as my beloved once did for me."
19,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SUZAKU_000_069","To think that I might have enjoyed these festivities with my one and only beloved, had only I not been so weak and powerless..."
20,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ZUIZYU_000_070","(-Feline Purr-)Ah, there you are. Kamaitachi here has been whining all day about just how much he missed you."
21,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ZUIZYU_000_071","(-Weaselly Voice-)Hey, that's not true! I just said, wouldn't it be nice if <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> happened to stop by?"
22,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ZUIZYU_000_072","(-Canine Growl-)Silence and stop moving, fool, lest I rend you limb from limb! Can't you see that Nue can barely hold us up as is?"
23,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ZUIZYU_000_073","(-Red Panda's Voice-)Mmf... How much longer do we have to stay like this!?"

26,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_TATARU_000_101","I was just stopping by to pay a visit to one of our contacts in the Twin Adders, when out of nowhere this fellow in a rabbit suit came by and handed me this egg. Isn't it pretty?"
27,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_TATARU_000_102","It just made me so happy that I figured, why not return the favor? The others won't miss me if I'm only gone for a while, no?"
28,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_TATARU_000_103","A happy Hatching–tide to you! Isn't this such a lovely festival?"
29,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_LANDENEL_000_150","Bah! Why did no one tell me that I'd have to wear this ridiculous outfit <Emphasis>before</Emphasis> I volunteered for security duty? And what are the rest of you doing here? "
30,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ALKAZOLKA_000_151","Ever since Setoto was cured of the disease, I've been taking her all around as part of my training. It's such a relief to know she'll not be the target of any overeager bounty hunters anymore!"
31,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SETOTO_000_152","Oh, I simply can't express how wonderful it feels to walk along Alka's side with not a care in the world! Landenel, sir...what do you think, seeing me as an ordinary girl like this?"
32,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_LANDENEL_000_153","Er, you may want to take another look at yourself..."
33,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BEATINE_000_200","Ah, hello there, child..."
34,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BEATINE_000_201","Mayhap you can assist me with something. I've crafted the most lovely gilded eggs from the finest of wood, yet not a single boy or girl has shown an interest in my creations. Whatever do you suppose might be the matter?"
35,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GAIRHARD_000_202","Ahem... How many times do I have to tell you? Maybe you'd have more luck if you put that godsdamned saw down before you approached the children!"

39,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ADKIRAGH_000_251","Wait─don't tell me. I can tell at a glance what you're thinking. “Why, Adkiragh,” you muse. “Whyever are you dressed as a dapper swine rather than a handsome hare?”"
40,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ADKIRAGH_000_252","And to that, I answer: recently, generous adventurers have given me all manner of curious costumes, from toads to Namazu and more. But I will not be swayed by fleeting trends of fashion. No, I have a style all my own, and I will stay true to myself to the end! Did I mention that suckling pig is one of the most popular items on the menu at the Hard Place?"
41,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ADKIRAGH_000_253","Far have I traveled in search of the finest ingredients! Yes, somewhere in the Shroud lies the exact combination of herbs and spices that will create a dish that will bring in customers from across the realm, and at long last bring the Hard Place back from the brink!"

43,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_NERO_000_301","Well, truth be told, I have made a <Emphasis>few</Emphasis> enhancements. For example, it can spit a piping hot jet of coffee straight from its mouth. <Emphasis>Good</Emphasis> coffee, too, unlike the swill brewed with a certain Mark XIV Thermo-something-or-another."
44,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_NERO_000_302","Forgotten about me, have you, Garlond? Heh... You'll remember all too well when my cute little bunny shows up with an extra-large Archon egg specially crafted just for you..."
