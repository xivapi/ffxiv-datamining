2,"TEXT_REGNOR4TISTABIE_00612_TISTABIE_000_020","Oh my, you are a naughty one sneaking back in here just to see me. I heard you'd stirred up quite the hornet's nest. And you look ever so uneasy... How about a little game to relieve some of that tension?"

10,"TEXT_REGNOR4TISTABIE_00612_TISTABIE_000_510","“High or Low” is a guessing game. You must decide whether the total of your three cards is higher or lower than the total of your opponent's cards."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4TISTABIE_00612_TISTABIE_000_511","The deck holds nine cards, with the pictures printed thereon representing the numbers one through nine. Each number appears only once in the deck, so there are no repeats."
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4TISTABIE_00612_TISTABIE_000_512","If you guess correctly, then you win the match. If both totals are the same, then another hand is dealt."
