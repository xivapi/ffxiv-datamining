1,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_01","Isembard has asked that you visit the Church of Saint Adama Landama to inter a corpse he has prepared for burial, and to speak to the priests about the missing commonfolk. Seek out Marques in the lichyard."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_02","Marques has directed you to an empty grave atop the nearby ridge. Bear the embalmed corpse to the gravesite."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_03","You have gently placed the embalmed body at the foot of the grave. Perform one final duty for the deceased and provide him a proper burial."
4,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_04","You have interred the dearly departed as Isembard requested. Return to Marques and tell him the deed is done."
5,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_05","Marques admits to knowing little of the commonfolk. He suggests you speak to Sister Ourcen within the church."
6,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_06","Sister Ourcen informs you that while the commonfolk confide a great many things in her, she has not heard anything that might help your investigation. Return to Camp Drybone and speak to Isembard once more."
7,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_07","Upon your return to Isembard at Camp Drybone, the ever-dashing Thancred appears to greet you. To Isembard's dismay, he suspects that the only person who could take the vigilant commonfolk by surprise is the very Sister Ourcen who takes their confession. Isembard, however, is not so easily convinced."

49,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_ISEMBARD_000_2","And so long as you are headed there...might I ask you to deliver this embalmed corpse? A morbid request, I grant you, but it must be borne to burial, and I trust none more than you to see it done."

There...there have been...so many bodies of late..."

...What? Missing people? I...I'm afraid I cannot help you."

Pardon me. You will find Sister Ourcen within the church walls."

60,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_OURCEN_000_31","Hm? You seek knowledge of missing Drybone inhabitants? It is true I am closer to the people than any other of the Order. I confide in them, and they in me. When they wish to speak to their keeper, Thal, I am the medium through which they do."
61,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_OURCEN_000_32","Should I learn anything pertinent, I will be sure to share the information with you. <sigh> I only wish Marques would be more helpful in the matter. I pray he did nothing to offend. He saw...terrible things during the Calamity... His scars run deep. Indeed, he seems to now prefer the company of the dead over the living."
62,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_OURCEN_000_33","While tragic, I fear such behavior ill befits the church. I received word not long ago that one of our recent visitors─a man called Thancred, I believe─took offense at his conduct. I must have words with Marques, and soon."
63,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_OURCEN_000_40","Please extend my gratitude to Isembard on behalf of the Order."
64,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_ISEMBARD_000_50","Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. A burial is no easy thing─even when the departed is a stranger. Were you able to learn aught of the missing commonfolk?"
65,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_THANCRED_000_51","You've been keeping yourself rather busy of late, haven't you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"

67,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_THANCRED_000_53","I, too, spoke with Ungust─more times than I care to count. There seems to be some truth to this notion of the commonfolk speaking their secrets only to those in service to the gods."
68,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_THANCRED_000_54","Prostration, prayer, penance. Abject deeds done behind closed doors, away from prying eyes. Who better to take the pious unawares than she who takes confession─the good Sister Ourcen herself?"
69,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_ISEMBARD_000_55","Ourcen!? She wouldn't... She <Emphasis>couldn't</Emphasis>!"
70,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_THANCRED_000_56","Even the most beautiful roses have thorns, my friend. And you would be wise to keep an eye to <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> rose."
