1,"TEXT_CLSGLD350_00655_SEQ_01","Roroton, the merchant for whom you previously crafted a pair of malachite earrings, has commissioned you to make a fire brand of peerless quality. Craft the item to the best of your ability and present it to Serendipity for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSGLD350_00655_SEQ_02","As usual, Gigi assists with the evaluation of your work. However, in an unusual turn of events, your fire brand appears to trigger bizarre pyromaniac tendencies hidden deep within the mammet's soul. Nevertheless, Serendipity assures you that there is no need for concern, and that she will see that Roroton receives his order without incident.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 40."

50,"TEXT_CLSGLD350_00655_SERENDIPITY_000_003","Ahaha, it's hard to believe he was once so furious with us! It's as if that unfortunate incident never happened at all!"
51,"TEXT_CLSGLD350_00655_SERENDIPITY_000_004","But returning to the matter at hand, Roroton has commissioned you to craft a fire brand─one of peerless quality, of course."
52,"TEXT_CLSGLD350_00655_SERENDIPITY_000_005","When you've finished, I must insist that I evaluate your work. It's not that I don't trust your craftsmanship, but Roroton is an important client, to say the least."
