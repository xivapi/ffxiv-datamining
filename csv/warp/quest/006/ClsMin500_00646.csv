The guildmaster bids you speak with Wide Gulley and learn all you can of the situation, that she might help her old friend and mentor."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN500_00646_SEQ_02","Wide Gulley admits that he has filed an official complaint to the Concern, so ashamed he was of his father's actions. He suggests you speak with the accused in order to hear his side of the story."

4,"TEXT_CLSMIN500_00646_SEQ_04","According to Adalberta, Deep Canyon's belief that she betrayed him is nothing but a misunderstanding. Loath to see him destroy his career due to this perceived slight, she bids you speak with Wide Gulley, and with him find a way to save his father."
5,"TEXT_CLSMIN500_00646_SEQ_05","In order to prove that he is fit to remain vice foreman, Deep Canyon must demonstrate to the Concern that he still has the confidence of guild members.

You are warned that these deposits only appear during certain times of day. Use the technique Truth of Mountains to locate darksteel ore that appears in the Coerthas central highlands at 1:00 a.m. (Eorzea time), mine the required quantity, and return it to Adalberta as quickly as you are able."
6,"TEXT_CLSMIN500_00646_SEQ_06","Owing to your intervention, Deep Canyon has been given a chance to redeem himself. With the matter now laid to rest, speak once more with the relieved Adalberta, who awaits you in the Miners' Guild."
