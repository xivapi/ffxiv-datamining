50,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_2","Tell me, are you familiar with effervescent water? Alchemists use it to make a substance called natron."
51,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_3","And bakers use natron for leavening─that is, raising dough."
52,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_4","Without it, there'd be no ginger cookies, crumpets, blood currant tarts..."
53,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_5","...Ahem. As you may have gathered, I'm fond of the odd sweet or three."
54,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_6","'Course, effervescent water's good for more than just baking. A lot of miners ask for a drop of it in their drinks─makes the stronger stuff that bit more refreshing, see."

56,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_8","But you didn't come here to hear my thoughts on food and drink, you came here to learn about mining. And so you shall─by procuring some effervescent water for me."
57,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_9","The Alchemists' Guild needs fifteen bottles of the stuff, and <Emphasis>urgently</Emphasis>─they couldn't stress that enough."
58,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_10","From what I can make out, they themselves are scrambling to fulfill an urgent order for natron from the Bismarck in Limsa Lominsa. It's one of Eorzea's finest restaurants, in case you didn't know."
59,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_11","Anyway, you'd best get going. You'll need to work fast to make up for all the time I wasted chattering about sweets and grog. Oh, and you'll have the best luck mining around Buscarron's Scar, over in the Black Shroud."
60,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_20","Fifteen bottles of effervescent water, quick as you can. And remember, you're like to find it in Buscarron's Scar, over in Gridania's South Shroud."

62,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_22","I'll see to it that these are sent over immediately. Ah, but before I do, I should probably expand a bit on what we were talking about earlier..."
63,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_23","Specifically, the part about mixing spirits with effervescent water... See, I wasn't lying when I told you a lot of folk find the combination refreshing. It <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> refreshing. In fact, adding a bit of bubbly water makes the stuff go down so easily, you have to be careful not to drink yourself under the table."
64,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_24","I say this partly for your own good...and partly because the lad whose task you just took care of <Emphasis>wasn't</Emphasis> careful."

66,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_28","He then slipped in his own puke and split his head open on the bar on his way down. Suffice it to say, he won't be working for a while."
67,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_29","Thankfully, you took up the slack, and all is well with the guild once more. I could do with a few more like you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Keep up the good work, you hear?"
