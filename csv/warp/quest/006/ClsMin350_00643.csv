1,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_SEQ_01","Adalberta has asked you to obtain twenty raw amethysts. Confessing that the gemstones are not her specialty, she bids you speak with Wide Gulley to learn where they might be found."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_SEQ_02","Wide Gulley obliges you with the information, but only because he is certain that you will fail at your task. Being careful to avoid the fearsome creatures in the area, make your way to Hopeseed Pond in the Central Shroud, and obtain twenty raw amethysts. Once you have the required quantity, present them to Wide Gulley."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_SEQ_03","Wide Gulley cannot hide his surprise that you were able to brave the dangers to procure the amethysts. To your credit, the man has come to see you as a rival, and expresses his intent to redouble his efforts. Keep working at your craft, that you might be prepared when the next contest inevitably comes.

※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta upon reaching level 40."

49,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_ADALBERTA_000_001","More so than that, he was impressed that you bested Wide Gulley in the contest. 'Tis no ordinary miner who can outdo the vice foreman's own son."
50,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_ADALBERTA_000_002","Lest you wonder, I knew full well who Wide Gulley's father was when I tried to pair you both up. I also know for a fact that he has his sights on my position."
51,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_ADALBERTA_000_003","There're some who whisper in my ear that I should expel him from the guild, but I can't help but think that shortsighted. After all, it's hardly a crime to want to be guildmaster."
52,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_ADALBERTA_000_004","What's more, Wide Gulley is a tremendously gifted miner, and I'm not in the business of punishing excellence. To be sure, I'm still better overall, but I'm not above admitting there are certain areas in which he's more knowledgeable."
53,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_ADALBERTA_000_005","I tell you this because you'll need to speak with him again for your next task. We've received an order for twenty raw amethysts, you see, and none among us know more about the stones than he does."
54,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_ADALBERTA_000_006","Now, I realize you didn't exactly get off on the right foot with Wide Gulley, but the two of you are guildmates, and guildmates help one another no matter their differences."

56,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_WIDEGULLEY_000_011","Aye, I know why you're here; I heard about the order for raw amethysts, too. No doubt you're wonderin' where to find 'em, and you're after my hard-earned knowledge."

64,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_WIDEGULLEY_000_023","Anyroad, it's one thing to find the amethysts, but do you even know aught about 'em? Their properties? What they represent?
...Hmph, thought not. Well, here's a free lesson."
65,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_WIDEGULLEY_000_024","Amethysts are lightnin'-aspected gemstones, prized as embodiments of calmness, decisiveness, an' intuition. In comin' back with such a large haul of 'em...it would seem you've got all these things."
66,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_WIDEGULLEY_000_025","I might've been hasty to pass judgment. The more I see you work, the more I see why the guildmaster's so fond of you."
