1,"TEXT_LUCKLA103_03229_SEQ_01","According to Iola, the new merchandise you helped develop should allow the Iron Bellows to operate comfortably for the foreseeable future. While the forgemaster considers how best to repay your assistance, she mentions that Eismon was over at the Wandering Stairs and seemed eager to speak with you. Something about a celebration...?"
2,"TEXT_LUCKLA103_03229_SEQ_02","You locate Eismon, and learn that the artisans are indeed planning to celebrate the forge's recent revival. As part of the festivities, they'd hoped to reclaim the ring Iola's father lost, but the moneylender in question is demanding more coin than they could possibly repay. Nee Marn, however, has a proposal involving the creation of another ring, and a dash of Nu Mou mischief. Synthesize an enchanting ring, and deliver it to Eismon's waiting hands.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Nee Marn's familiar."
3,"TEXT_LUCKLA103_03229_SEQ_03","You deliver the enchanting ring to Eismon. The time has come to attempt the trade with Walden at Musica Universalis."
4,"TEXT_LUCKLA103_03229_SEQ_04","With you at his side, Eismon approaches Walden, and offers to trade your crafted ring for Iola's keepsake. The moneylender balks at first, but after seeing the ring's exceptional quality, he soon changes his tune. Eismon returns to the Wandering Stairs, the surprise gift for Iola clutched tightly in his fist."
5,"TEXT_LUCKLA103_03229_SEQ_05","Once the celebrations are underway, Eismon presents the reclaimed ring to Iola on behalf of his Iron Bellows colleagues. For her part, Iola is overcome with emotion, and embraces her artisans as the family she's long been missing. Speak to the forgemaster in the aftermath of the festivities."
6,"TEXT_LUCKLA103_03229_SEQ_06","Iola once more expresses her gratitude for your tireless assistance, and assures you that the forge now has enough momentum to continue under its own steam. And if trouble does rear its head, the forgemaster is confident that she can handle it with the help of her three eccentric artisans. Should you ever find yourself missing the peculiar family at the Iron Bellows, Iola urges you to come and pay them a visit."
