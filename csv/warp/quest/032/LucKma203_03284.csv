49,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_001","If we time our arrival just right, you may be lucky enough to see why I have yet to set foot in Eulmore─despite my best efforts to do so..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_002","Come. From here, we must head west, and then cross a small bridge..."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_010","Kholusia seems peaceful, does it not? Almost...familiar? I had a similar impression of the Crystarium. Even in this distant world, people are much the same."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_011","<sigh> To think that whenever a calamity struck the Source, a reflection such as this one─with all its culture and history─was being erased from existence..."

58,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_FEARLADY03284_000_040","My poor heart... Thank you, young <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_041","Ah, there you are! In my haste, I lost my bearings... But I see you have the situation well in hand. Fine work!"
60,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_042","Are you alright, madam?"
61,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_FEARLADY03284_000_043","Just a few bruises from where I fell. Nothing compared to what was in store for me before this brave soul came to my rescue."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_FEARLADY03284_000_044","I honestly thought I was done for. My feet are not as swift as they once were, and I knew there was no one left to hear me scream. Not that I let that stop me!"
63,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_FEARLADY03284_000_045","<sigh> I should probably leave my old house behind and queue up outside Eulmore with the rest of them."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_FEARLADY03284_000_046","Doubt those fancy lords and ladies would welcome an old crone like me... Still, even a shack near the gate has to be safer than staying here!"
65,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_047","One would hope. Either way, I suggest you avoid wandering alone, lest you make the sin eaters' task any easier."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_FEARLADY03284_000_048","Thank you again. You saved my life. Now, I'm sure a strapping <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If> like you has little to fear, but I wouldn't linger long in this place. There's naught to be had here but cobwebs and memories."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_049","'Tis as the lady says. Many in these parts have abandoned their homes to live in Eulmore's shadow."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_050","Should the sin eaters descend upon this region, there are precious few with the strength to fight them off..."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_051","Speaking of which, what have you been told of these monsters?"
70,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_052","Ah, yes. Alisaie would be well qualified to speak on the subject."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_053","Compared with Amh Araeng, Kholusia is almost a haven... But as you saw, we cannot let our guard down. Had you arrived but a few moments later, the sin eaters would have claimed another victim."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_054","A brief history, then...
'Twas not long after the Flood swallowed the better part of the world that the sin eaters first appeared, some beastly, some beauteous."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_055","Yet regardless of their form, all seem incapable of speech, and all are driven by the same insatiable appetite for mortal aether. They are predators─and we are their prey."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_056","Kholusia suffers from far fewer attacks than most regions, but even so, the list of the sin eaters' victims grows longer by the day. A tragedy without end..."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_057","Still, we have won a small victory this time, at least. Now, shall we press on?"
76,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_058","We need to return to where the road forks and follow the path that leads west..."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_060","And here we are."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_GATETOWNMIDDLEAGE_000_070","Mmm, do I savor it piece by piece, or gobble it all in one go...?"
79,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_DREAMINGLADY03284_000_075","Ah, Eulmore, you taunt me with your promised bounty..."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_080","Now you understand why my attempts to enter the city have thus far come to naught. The dubious privilege of residency must be won via a contest with ever-changing rules..."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_081","They say this policy has been in place for the past two decades, ever since Eulmore's current ruler came into power."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_082","Yet from what I have seen, it does more harm than good. Not only does it distract people from our shared struggle against the sin eaters, it robs them of their self-sufficiency. I have tried to propose ways they could improve their lot, but my words invariably fall on deaf ears."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_083","The attitude is so <Emphasis>entrenched</Emphasis> now, I worry that─ Well, mayhap you should take a turn around Gatetown, and judge the situation for yourself."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_090","Go, take the measure of Gatetown. I shall wait here."
85,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_SYSTEM_000_100","A large pot bubbles over the flame. Pale chunks─meol, you realize─float in the otherwise plain broth."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_GATETOWNMIDDLEAGE_000_110","Still here, are you? Can't blame you for wanting a slice of Eulmore's pie. If you ask me, you should ditch that sour-faced brat and make a home for yourself here!"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_GATETOWNMIDDLEAGE_000_111","Gatetown's not much to look at, aye, but at least it's safe. And the meol is the best thing I've ever tasted!"
88,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_DREAMINGLADY03284_000_120","Just look at it... Can you imagine a more beautiful city?"
89,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_DREAMINGLADY03284_000_121","Every day, I dream of the life that waits for me inside those walls. Oh, will they <Emphasis>ever</Emphasis> pick me...?"
90,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_130","You've seen what Gatetown has to offer?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_131","These people can no longer fend for themselves. They've become dependent on handouts of meol, and believe Eulmore is the answer to all their woes."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMA203_03284_ALPHINAUD_000_132","Yet no matter how I frame my encouragement, they seem unwilling─nay, <Emphasis>unable</Emphasis>─to conceive of any other way of life..."
