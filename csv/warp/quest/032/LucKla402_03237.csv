82,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_MAOLADD_000_045","Lest you wonder, it's a shred of scaly skin. I spotted it in this area, Timh Gyeus, after noticing rub marks on the trees and rocks."

84,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_YALANA_000_052","While droppings can tell us much about a creature, there's no substitute for an actual piece of it. In spite of myself, I'm quite excited, I must admit!"
85,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_QESHIRAE_000_060","So, did you find the shred of skin?"
86,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_QESHIRAE_000_061","Mmm-hmmm! While it's a little on the shriveled side, this is indeed skin from the creature. It was likely molting."
87,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_YALANA_000_062","A molting creature! That's one more thing we know about it! I can't wait to see what else this specimen can tell us!"

91,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_MAOLADD_000_066","Th-That's odd... It was there just a moment ago. And its shape─I'd swear it matches that of the shadow I saw in Amh Araeng."
92,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_MAOLADD_000_067","I don't know how, but it literally disappeared in the blink of an eye."
93,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_MAOLADD_000_068","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you saw it too, didn't you? It wasn't just my imagination?"

95,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_QESHIRAE_000_070","Tell me, what did it look like? What was its color? Smell? Size?"
96,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_YALANA_000_071","Chief, perhaps we should save the questions for after we leave this place. Even with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, it may not be entirely safe for us here."
97,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_QESHIRAE_000_072","Yes, you have the right of it. It wouldn't do to have the faeries get their hands on our precious specimen. Come, let's return to the Crystarium."
98,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_YALANA_000_075","Thank you for helping us to find Mao-Ladd. I shudder to think what may have happened to him."

100,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_QESHIRAE_000_080","Well, that was certainly a harrowing outing, but it wasn't without fruit─in the form of a piece of the samiel itself! Ahhh, to feel the scaly texture in my hands and breathe in its mysterious smell... Pure bliss, I tell you!"
101,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_QESHIRAE_000_081","Alas, Yalana snatched it from me before I could have a little taste..."
102,"TEXT_LUCKLA402_03237_QESHIRAE_000_082","Well, for now we'll just have to leave her to her task. I'm sure she'll have new information for us before long, so do not wander far!"
