54,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_006","From that time on, Owell and I drifted apart. Eventually we stopped speaking entirely. It was only when I announced my intention to open my shop that he had words for me, and they were none too kind. “You don't understand anything,” he spat out angrily."
55,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_007","Well, he's right in one regard. I don't understand why he so detests my work. It goes beyond mere disapproval. He makes it personal, as if I've done something to offend him."
56,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_008","This wouldn't be a problem, except Owell holds considerable influence at the Mean. A bad word from him and we would get no more custom.

118,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_081","W-Well, that's because no one could restore it properly save Master himself. An instrument demands consummate skill. Back then it was completely beyond me, and even now I don't feel equal to the task."
119,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_082","But I must try. Master wouldn't want to see Owell and I quarreling. No, he'd want us to join hands and serve the Crystarium and her people."
120,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_083","As it does for me, the lute holds fond memories for Owell. By restoring it, I'm hopeful that we can reach out to him."
121,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_084","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, this time it's a personal request. I need your help to make this lute sing once more."
122,"TEXT_LUCKLA202_03231_THIUNA_000_085","Thank you. It gives me heart to have your support. I'll make ready for the restoration and let you know what I require."
