1,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_01","You reunite with Oboro, who cheerfully proclaims that he has at long last devised a plan to get the better of his longtime rival, Karasu Redbeak, and recover the half of the forbidden mudra scroll currently in the flamboyant ninja's possession. Splitting up so as not to attract attention, you make for the Hermit's Hovel─a bathhouse where Karasu has recently taken up residence─where Oboro means to elaborate on the details of his plan."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_02","Upon your arrival, Oboro eagerly explains how he intends to thwart his rival. Oboro intends to distract Karasu in the midst of his daily bathing ritual, allowing you to sneak into the bathhouse and make off with the scroll─a strategy not unlike the one you employed on a previous adventure back in Kugane. Wait in the shadows at Oboro's instruction, and be prepared to make your move when Karasu has been lured away from the scene."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_03","Oboro's ruse is a great success, as Karasu is all too willing to join him in a leisurely chat over some Hingan rice wine, leaving the bathhouse entirely unattended. Infiltrate the structure and sort through Karasu's belongings in search of the scroll before the wily ninja wises up to the situation and returns."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_04","You succeed in finding the scroll alongside other considerably less helpful documents also scattered throughout the hovel. Make a discreet retreat and return to the Long Climb that you might rendezvous with Oboro and ascertain that what you found is indeed the authentic item."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_05","Oboro rejoices upon seeing the scroll in your possession and declares the entire operation an unqualified triumph. He invites you to return to the dock storehouse that you might discuss matters further in private, and goes off on his way."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_06","As Oboro revels in his triumph over his bitter rival, the two of you are joined by your mutual friend Captain Jacke of the Dutiful Sisters. Heartened by the unexpected reunion, the jovial rogue invites the both of you for celebratory dinner and drinks at the Bismarck, an offer which Oboro accepts gladly. Make your way to Limsa Lominsa, where you might share a fine feast with your companions."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_07","At the Bismarck, your revelry is interrupted when Oboro rushes into the establishment half-naked. You and Captain Jacke quickly deduce that the “Oboro” whom you reunited with after the operation was none other than Karasu in disguise, a suspicion which is quickly confirmed when the savvy ninja reveals his true identity. The crow, victorious again over his erstwhile friend, offers a few mocking words, then turns into a bat and flaps away, leaving Oboro dejected and stark naked in the middle on the tavern floor. Jacke offers a few words of sympathy, and invites all of you back to the Sisters that you might find the poor man some clothes."
8,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_SEQ_08","You arrive at the Sisters to find Oboro decked out in clothes from Captain Jacke's personal wardrobe, a particularly garish outfit to which the fashion-challenged ninja has inexplicably taken a liking. He fills you in on the particulars of his inglorious defeat at Karasu's hands, resolving in the end to get his revenge on his rival. After Oboro takes his leave, Captain Jacke encourages you not to be a stranger in La Noscea, as both he and your ninja friends will like as not have need of your services again."

51,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_100_002","I speak, of course, of that blasted Karasu. Ever since he escaped with half of the forbidden scroll, I have not let up the search for a moment. Today, at long last, I have found him! Truly, this is reason to rejoice, would you not agree?"

53,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_000_004","Once again, I owe you my gratitude. Now, let us get down to brass tacks, as Jacke would say. My shinobi have ascertained that Karasu has once again returned to Eorzean shores to ply his trade─such as it is─in the shadows of the black markets."
54,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_000_005","Furthermore, they say he has taken up residence in secret at a secluded grove in La Noscea known as the Hermit's Hovel. You know the place, yes?

58,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_000_012","I had a mind to lift the scroll from his possessions while he was otherwise occupied─much as we did with Zakuro that one time in Kugane─but would you believe it? Almost as if by magic, no sooner has he entered the baths than he is out again, scroll at his side and fully dressed in that garish garb of his."
59,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_000_013","This is where you come in. Worry not: this will not involve any high-wire walking or elaborate disguises. I simply intend to invite the man to share a drink, and thereby delay his departure. In the meantime, you are to sneak into the bathhouse and steal away with the scroll."
60,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_000_014","Ingeniously plotted, would you not say!? I need only lull Karasu into a false sense of security with my impeccable acting skills, and the scroll is as good as ours! What could go wrong?"
61,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_000_015","So let us put the plan in action. Let us make for the hovel─separately, of course. Find yourself suitable cover, and wait for me to lure the crow away. We shall meet again here once you have safely recovered the scroll."

73,"TEXT_LUCKBC010_03219_OBORO_000_030","I know you too well, Karasu. It is not power that you crave, but freedom. You have worked too long, too hard to cast off the shackles of our village to risk losing it all over a single scroll."
