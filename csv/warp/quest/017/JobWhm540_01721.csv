1,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_01","Eschiva has completed the necessary preparations for the next leg of your mission, which will take you to the western highlands of Coerthas. She suggests that you first make a stop in the hamlet of Falcon's Nest, that you might gather information from the locals."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_02","You rejoin Eschiva at Falcon's Nest. Having mused about her grandfather's journeys, she bids you speak with the locals and ask whether they know anything of the taint."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_03","Much to your chagrin, the locals know nothing of the taint. However, they tell you that a foreign woman reeking of death has come through Falcon's Nest recently. Make your way to the northern entrance of Falcon's Nest and report your findings to Eschiva."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_04","It appears your investigation will take you in the same direction as the foreign woman. Setting aside the question of coincidence in your mind, make your way to the northwestern corner of the western highlands, to the area south of the Slate Mountains, and rejoin Eschiva."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_05","You and Eschiva find the foreign woman crouching over the remains of a dragon. At the end of an awkward conversation, the woman warns you to leave her alone. Who is this Alaqa, and what is her purpose? Though such questions plague you, for now you must focus on your mission. Eschiva believes that the taint has manifested nearby; find it and purify it."
6,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_06","You have succeeded in purifying the second manifestation of the taint. Rejoin Eschiva west of Banepool and relay the good tidings to her."
7,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_07","Eschiva is pleased to hear that the taint corrupts the area no more. Rather than stand out in the cold, she suggests you first return to Falcon's Nest to discuss recent events."
8,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_SEQ_08","Though shaken by her meeting with the mysterious Alaqa, Eschiva is determined to continue the mission to rid the realm of the taint. While she resumes her investigation of water veins, continue honing your powers of purification, for they will be called upon again before long.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Eschiva upon reaching level 56."

55,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_043","When you have finished, pray come and meet me at the hamlet's northern entrance."
56,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_FORCHETAIX_100_050","...The taint? Never heard of it. We've had a strange visitor, however─a foreign woman with the stench of death about her."
57,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_FORCHETAIX_100_051","Suspicious as she was, I decided to steal a peek at her belongings, and─

58,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_FORCHETAIX_100_052","Anyway, after that, some few of us confronted her and demanded to know her purpose, but she refused to say a word. Nay, she looked straight through us with empty eyes and left the hamlet. As I recall, she was headed to the north and west. Wherever it is she has gone, we are well rid of her."
59,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_TOURCENET_100_060","I am unfamiliar with this taint of which you speak. We do consider dragons unclean, however."
60,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_TOURCENET_100_061","Speaking of the beasts, lately, there have been reports of a strange woman skulking about their remains. We are on the lookout for her, lest she prove to be a heretic."
61,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_FORCHETAIX_100_070","The foreign woman who reeked of death? After we confronted her, she left the hamlet and struck out to the north and west. We are well rid of her, I tell you."

64,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_091","There are water sources in the northwestern corner of the region─frozen lakes, to be precise─and I would take our investigation there."
65,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_092","I mislike the sound of this woman, and I'd sooner not cross paths with her, but we have a mission to fulfill. Let us keep moving."

80,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_113","Well, that was certainly queer... I know not what compelled me to speak with that woman─Alaqa, I believed she called herself─but I must confess to being morbidly curious about her experiment. But I mustn't let myself be distracted─we have work to do."
81,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_114","Unless I am mistaken, the taint has manifested in this area. Let us split up and search for it."

84,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_121","Though, I cannot help but wonder: is it truly a coincidence that the taint chanced to have manifested where we met Alaqa?"
85,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_122","Brrr... Being frozen to the bone isn't conducive to conversation. Let us return to Falcon's Nest and warm ourselves before we discuss matters in earnest."
86,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_130","With your most recent effort, I sense that your powers continue to grow. Suffice it to say this is a boon to our cause."
87,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_131","The mission proceeds smoothly thus far. If we continue following the water vein, it should lead us to the source of the taint."
88,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_132","As for the stranger, Alaqa─never have I felt so unsettled in someone's presence."
89,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_133","The thought that she might be connected to the taint also bothers me, but until we know for certain, it avails us naught to dwell upon it."
90,"TEXT_JOBWHM540_01721_ESCHIVA_000_134","For now, I shall resume my investigation of water veins and try to deduce other locations where the taint might appear."
