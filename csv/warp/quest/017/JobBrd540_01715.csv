1,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_01","Sanson informs you that he has received information from Ser Alamenain on the Ballad of Oblivion. Specifically, the woman who is said to sing the song is a soldier stationed at the Convictory. Sanson declares that the three of you will go there to seek her out. Make your way to the Ishgardian encampment and join your companions."
2,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_02","You have tracked down the soldier, Celaine. However, though she admits to singing the song, she stubbornly refuses to teach it to you. Presently, Guydelot is attempting to coax it out of her; ask him how his efforts fare."
3,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_03","No amount of words will sway Celaine to teach you the song, and Guydelot is loath to press her further. But Sanson, determined to accomplish his duty, proposes a deal: the three of you will assist the Ishgardians in a dragon-culling operation in exchange for being near in case Celaine employs the song in battle. Make your way to Twinpools and present yourself to the Convictor knight to receive instructions."
4,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_04","The Convictor knight bids you help by thinning out the dragons. Lie in wait at the location he has marked on your map, and defeat the creatures that appear."
5,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_05","You have dispatched a sufficient number of dragons. Rejoin Sanson and the others."
6,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_06","Though the culling operation is a success, the Convictors have incurred heavy losses. Stricken with sadness, Celaine begins singing a requiem for her fallen comrades, which Guydelot recognizes as the song to send souls unto the heavens. Follow Sanson's lead and pay your respects with a /salute."
7,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_07","Appreciative of your gesture, Celaine opens up to you. At Guydelot's encouragement, she resolves to savor the time she has with her comrades, rather than keep them at arm's length to spare herself the pain of loss. In her turn, she counsels Guydelot and Sanson to appreciate each other's company. Finally, she speaks of the requiem, which she says was taught to her by a scholar of Ishgardian history named Sylviel, who is based in the settlement of Tailfeather. Speak with Sanson to learn what your next step will be."
8,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_08","It is decided that you will go to Tailfeather to seek out Sylviel. Make your way to the settlement in the Dravanian forelands and rejoin your companions."
9,"TEXT_JOBBRD540_01715_SEQ_09","Sylviel has apparently left Tailfeather on one of his many surveys, and you must await his return. With the mission taking you into ever more perilous territory, see to it that you are fully prepared for whatever lies ahead.

※The next bard quest will be available upon reaching level 56."
