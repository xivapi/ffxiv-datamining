1,"TEXT_LUCKTA201_03784_SEQ_01","As usual, the dig site chief is worried about Anogg and Konogg─or rather, their capacity to wreak havoc if left to their own devices for long enough. He also mentions that they have been shirking their village duties to continue their research into the key that you located in the Copied Factory, and asks that you remind them of this fact after you have finished confirming whether they've set anything on fire."
2,"TEXT_LUCKTA201_03784_SEQ_02","Per the chief's request, you speak to Anogg, who immediately expresses her frustration with the progress of their tinkering. Said progress, as Konogg explains, is in fact quite substantial─the two have been able to confirm that the device you recovered is in fact the “key” to some manner of weaponry, and were even able to get it working. Alas, its energy reserves ran dry soon after, and it will require additional power if it is to fulfill its purpose. This is typically the point at which one or the other of them would request you find a power source for them, but their incessant need to bicker reasserts itself at the critical moment, sparing you being set a new task. For now."

49,"TEXT_LUCKTA201_03784_DWARFMASTER03671_000_002","They're still poking and prodding at those whatsits you dug up in the ruins. Which is all well and good until one of them sets off <Emphasis>another</Emphasis> explosion..."

69,"TEXT_LUCKTA201_03784_KONOGG_100_074","The pod confirmed that this device grants the user access to some sort of weaponry, which presumably means that it is indeed the key of which 2P spoke."
70,"TEXT_LUCKTA201_03784_KONOGG_000_074","Unfortunately, no sooner had we gotten it working than it stopped again. Based on our previous experiences, we assume that it's run out of power, and will require a supplementary energy source."
71,"TEXT_LUCKTA201_03784_ANOGG_000_075","So let's hurry up and find one! The sooner we get the key working, the sooner we can pulverize our enemies."
72,"TEXT_LUCKTA201_03784_KONOGG_000_076","Now, wait just a moment. We aren't even certain what sort of weaponry is involved here. Even if we get the key working again, we shouldn't activate it willy-nilly."
