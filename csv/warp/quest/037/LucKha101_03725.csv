Likely on account of this, Francel is late to return from his efforts to bring people to the new district, and you are tasked with tracking the young lord down in the Brume."

Having witnessed firsthand the trust people harbor for you, Francel begs for your continued assistance in running the fledgling district."
3,"TEXT_LUCKHA101_03725_SEQ_03","You agree to assist Francel, who expresses his profound gratitude. Without further ado, he tasks you with delivering three missives, which he explains are entreaties for cooperation in the restoration effort. The recipients are Gibrillont, the proprietor of the Forgotten Knight; Ser Handeloup, second commander of the Temple Knights; and Elaisse, the master of the Ishgardian markets."
4,"TEXT_LUCKHA101_03725_SEQ_04","You have delivered the missives and received positive responses from all three recipients; Gibrillont is happy to provide meals, Ser Handeloup will speak in favor of dispatching the Temple Knights' engineers, and Elaisse will personally work to procure the heavy machinery sought. Your task accomplished, you head to the Firmament to report to Francel."
