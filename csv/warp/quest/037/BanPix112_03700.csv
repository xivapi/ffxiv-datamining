49,"TEXT_BANPIX112_03700_UINNEE_000_002","I'd love to try it here, but those horrid Fuath are bound to show up and spoil our fun! 
...Oh, of course! We can do it in Lyhe Mheg instead, and have the children join us too!"
50,"TEXT_BANPIX112_03700_UINNEE_000_003","There's just one problem: I haven't the faintest idea what a boat looks like. Perhaps we can try making one from the wing of a deepglider...which I'm sure you'll be more than willing to collect for me!"
51,"TEXT_BANPIX112_03700_UINNEE_000_020","I have a vague recollection of asking you to bring me something... What was it?"
52,"TEXT_BANPIX112_03700_UINNEE_000_021","Ah, yes! I remember now! This should work nicely. Not that I have a clue what to do with it..."
53,"TEXT_BANPIX112_03700_UINNEE_000_022","So it needs to float on the water and support the weight of several small children. It can't be that difficult to make a thing like that from a bit of lizard skin, can it?"
54,"TEXT_BANPIX112_03700_UINNEE_000_023","And since we won't be boating on real water, as long as we can conjure up something that at least <Emphasis>looks</Emphasis> like a boat, it should be fine. Oh yes, we'll have the finest adventures with the children on the ocean blue! ...It <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> blue, isn't it?"
