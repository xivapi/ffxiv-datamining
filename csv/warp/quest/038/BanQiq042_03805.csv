Grudgingly agreeing that his son may have a point, the stubborn Qitari agrees to assist in the restoration of the third stela.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

Encouraged and heartened by reclaiming yet another vital piece of their legacy, the Stewards now pursue their excavation efforts with newfound zeal. Continue to lend them your aid in their efforts should you so desire."
