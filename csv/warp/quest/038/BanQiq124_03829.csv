48,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_QHOTERLPASOL_000_000","The other day residents from Slitherbough brought a gift most divine─chicken eggs! And let me tell you, to say that their flavor was transcendent hardly begins to describe the experience!"
49,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_QHOTERLPASOL_000_001","I had scarce tasted the first egg when I knew we must have more. Being the enterprising Qitari that I am, I've arranged to exchange our precious stones for their precious eggs. One of nature's bounties for another─a capital bargain if I do say so myself!"
50,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_QHOTERLPASOL_000_002","We have already delivered our first cache of stones, but someone must pick up the eggs from Slitherbough. If you would be so kind, I'll ensure that you're handsomely compensated! "
51,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_POULTRYFARMER03829_000_010","I take it you're here about the eggs, then? I'd love to give them to you, but I'm afraid I've run into a snag. One of my chickens fled the coop, you see, clucking like the sky itself was falling down!"
52,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_POULTRYFARMER03829_000_011","Gods only know where she is now, but I reckon I'd find her quicker if I had another set of eyes looking for her. What say you? Lend a hand and I'll give you the pick of my best eggs!"
53,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_POULTRYFARMER03829_000_012","If you catch sight of her, use this sack to scoop her up. I'll stay around the village, while you go ahead and look around the outskirts─I reckon you might hear her before you see her!"
54,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_POULTRYFARMER03829_000_020","I've searched everywhere, but I haven't seen hide nor down of that pesky bird. I hope you've had better luck than me."
55,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_POULTRYFARMER03829_000_021","Ah, that's her all right! You're a godssend! I was worried she'd been gobbled up whole by some bigger animal. She always lays the best eggs─it would've been a tragedy to lose her."
56,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_POULTRYFARMER03829_000_022","Speaking of eggs, I believe these are for you. And as I promised, here's a few more on top as your just reward. Give my regards to the Qitari, and let them know I'm open for business any time!"
57,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_QHOTERLPASOL_000_030","Would that the Qitari could lay eggs. Hmm, perhaps if I...
Oh! You're back! Do you have them!? Do you!?"
58,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_QHOTERLPASOL_000_031","Oh, you have saved─
Hmph, I mean, splendid! These eggs are even more pleasing to behold than the last batch, and there are so many of them! I would've sent one of my workers to fetch these, but the sad truth is that no Qitari could be trusted with the task. "
59,"TEXT_BANQIQ124_03829_QHOTERLPASOL_000_032","The eggs would have been devoured before they were one yalm from Slitherbough. That you showed enough restraint to deliver them untouched truly speaks to your heroic pedigree!"
