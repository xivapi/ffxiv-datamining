1,"TEXT_XXAUSA104_03858_SEQ_01","Papalymo believes that offering aid to the troubled sylphs in Little Solace would go far toward earning their trust. As the sylphs are not wont to share their troubles with outsiders, seek the advice of Hearer Imedia."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSA104_03858_SEQ_02","As Imedia would tell it, the sylphs live in constant fear of attacks by ill-tempered forest creatures. She bids you slay a ziz gorlin and a gall gnat, that the residents of Little Solace might rest easy, and suggests that procuring three brownie brushes in the process would also go far to curry the sylphs' favor."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSA104_03858_SEQ_03","You have dispatched the invasive fauna, and obtained brownie brushes for the sylphs. Report to Komuxio of Little Solace and impress upon him your good intentions."
4,"TEXT_XXAUSA104_03858_SEQ_04","Komuxio expresses gratitude for your efforts on behalf of Little Solace. It would seem the sylphs have begun to warm to your presence, albeit gradually."
