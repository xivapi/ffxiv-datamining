The isle designer believes that a little learning is a dangerous thing─though perhaps not for the commonly accepted reasons."

Alas, we know little of such concepts...and last I attempted “a bit of research,” I woke up three days later with far too much information about grypes."

Thus do I require your services─you need only ask the researchers at Anagnorisis for a brief introduction to poisonous creatures, and steadfastly ignore any niggling curiosity in favor of reporting back here."

67,"TEXT_AKTKZG019_04294_EUKLEIDES_000_035","The quintessential example of a poisonous specimen is the morbol marquis, of course. Never was there a creation so foul, so pungent─hence the name. Indeed, the concept has lately been adjusted to prevent any further...accidents."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZG019_04294_EUKLEIDES_000_036","But the marquis! Oh, the marquis. It blinds the eyes and paralyzes the body, even as the mind desires nothing so much as to vomit continually to purge its stench..."
