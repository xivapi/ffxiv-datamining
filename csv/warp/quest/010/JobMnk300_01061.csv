Without protection, the professor cannot continue his research, which is why you must aid in carrying out the crucial fieldwork.

Upon witnessing this, a senior monk named Widargelt gifts you with a soul crystal─the mark of a member of the monkhood. He explains that with it, you will come to learn the skills of those monks who bore it before you, but only after your chakra have opened further. For now, retrieve the aetherometer."
