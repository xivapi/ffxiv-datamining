1,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_SEQ_01","A–Ruhn–Senna, unconvinced by his sister's words, has run off to the Bramble Patch on his own to prove that your powers are not needed. Raya–O–Senna, fearing for her brother's safety, asks you to go look for him."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_SEQ_02","Despite suffering injury in his foolhardy quest to placate the forest single-handedly, A–Ruhn–Senna remains as stubborn as ever. Placate the tree in his stead."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_SEQ_03","By communing with an elemental before A–Ruhn–Senna's eyes, you have grudgingly won the trust of the proud young Padjal. Return to Camp Tranquil and speak with Raya–O–Senna."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_SEQ_04","Raya–O–Senna informs you that her brother, despite his misgivings, has finally come to accept your participation in the Quieting. To commune with the great one, however, no ordinary powers will suffice. Continue to hone your skills, that you might join the two Seedseers in healing the forest.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna upon reaching level 45."

71,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_041","When we first met, I promised that one day I would share with you the tale of how white magic came to be regarded as a forbidden art. Well, I suppose this is as good a day as any for the telling."
72,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_042","The tale begins some three millennia ago, in the Fifth Astral Era. It was the time of the Endless Frost, when a barren wasteland of snow and rime stretched as far as the eye could see."
73,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_043","Food was scarce, and warmth scarcer. The histories hold many a grim tale of those who died in their beds, starving and benumbed. So did our ancestors discover magic, born out of the most fundamental instinct─survival."
74,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_044","In time, the winter thawed, and magic was no longer essential for survival. But once awakened to its conveniences, there was no returning to how things once were. Ere long, the people discovered all the myriad ways in which magic could be employed, and civilization flourished."
75,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_045","But prosperity breeds contempt, and nations warred for power and riches. So did the people seek greater and greater power, to rain destruction down upon their enemies. So was born black magic, the most devastating form of sorcery the world had seen."
76,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_046","At the same time, another form of magic emerged, brought forth by those who would keep this immense destructive power in check. That is white magic─our magic. Does this surprise you? Just as there can be no dawn without the night, the white and black are but two sides of the same coin."
77,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_047","War raged on, and magic was used and abused with little concern for the consequences. And consequences there were─unchecked use of magic soon dried the flow of aether, threatening to bring blight to the land."
78,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_048","The magic of healing? It made little difference. If used with no concern for the aether, our magic could prove as ruinous to the land as the most devastating black magic spell. And so it was that the practicing of white magic was forbidden...with one exception."
79,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_049","...The Padjal. Our kind were entrusted as sole shepherds of the now-forbidden art, to serve as healers and bringers of peace while ensuring that this great power would never again be misused."
80,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_050","Though he is still young, A–Ruhn feels this profound sense of responsibility as strongly as any of us, thus his hesitance to accept you. But having seen your abilities─and the sincerity of your intentions─you can rest assured his doubts have been dispelled."
81,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_051","With the three of us united in place and purpose, and your skills ever growing, the day that we may perform the Quieting draws near. To our fortune, the great one has not yet been entirely consumed by fury, but our time remains short."
82,"TEXT_JOBWHM400_01081_RAYAOSENNA_000_052","To commune with the great one, and restore the Twelveswood to its former state of harmony, we must truly be one of heart, one of mind."
