※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN101_02171_SEQ_01","Muna Vanu has heard troubling reports of Vundu activity at the border of Zundu territory. Unfortunately, his tribe does not have the manpower to respond to these threats. He asks that you patrol the border in his stead, and protect the Gundu from any encroachers you come across. Travel to the border in the northeast and search there for Vundu scouts.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANVAN101_02171_SEQ_03","Muna Vanu offers his most sincere thanks for your efforts. His tribe still owes the Zundu a great debt of gratitude, and your efforts have gone a long way in repaying their kindness. By the same token, through your contributions to the Gundu, Muna Vanu finds they have become similarly indebted to you."
