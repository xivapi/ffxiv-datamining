※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM205_02140_SEQ_01","Haermaga is concerned that the Go Go Posing Rangers, despite having improved over the course of their training, are still lacking in the way of teamwork. Unfortunately, they have run out of time, for the king and his minions have begun to venture inland. After requesting that you lend the Rangers your strength on the battlefield, the grand chaperone bids you meet them at Hidden Falls so that together you might organize a strategy to defeat the Bombard King before any harm comes to the people.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM205_02140_SEQ_02","You rendezvous with the Go Go Posing Rangers, who are one member short. As you wait for the Red Ranger to arrive, the other two explain they have yet to perfect the Firefall Battle Formation because their missing comrade often overthinks the steps, causing him to fall out of sync. Luckily, the Yellow and Black Rangers believe they may have found a way to combat this problem through meditation, and request that you hold off the Bombards that have appeared on the shores long enough for them to walk him through the process. Participate in the FATE “In Deep Water” and help the Rangers defeat the Bombard King.

※Participate in the FATE “In Deep Water” followed by the FATE “Trial by Fire” to defeat the Bombard King."

4,"TEXT_FESSUM205_02140_SEQ_04","The Yellow and Black Rangers are waiting by the waterfall for you in the aftermath of the battle. True to form, the Red Ranger joins you all a short while later, still refusing to remove his mask. The other two, however, eventually goad him into revealing his identity, and hiding beneath the red mask, is the face of none other than Haermaga. Having learned a valuable lesson in both teamwork and the meaning of friendship, he tells you that he believes this will be the start of a long and successful career of fighting evil for him and his two comrades."
