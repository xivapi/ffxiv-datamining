1,"TEXT_JOBSCH500_01102_SEQ_01","Another knife-wielding denizen of the Wanderer's Palace has emerged to terrorize the people of Vylbrand, and once again it falls to the Marauders' Guild to find and slay it. Determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past, Alka Zolka has enlisted the aid of two other marauders. He would also like you to join as well─but only if you can promise to keep your faerie in check. If you can, rendezvous with him and the others in Bronze Lake, at the same ruins where you fought the first tonberry."
2,"TEXT_JOBSCH500_01102_SEQ_02","You pursue the tonberry to the Wanderer's Palace, leaving many of its brethren slain in your wake. As the creature grows weaker, Alka Zolka once again raises his axe to deliver the final blow─and once again is prevented from doing so by your faerie. At last understanding her intent, the two of you turn your restorative magicks upon the tonberry. Rejuvenated, it rises to its feet, and reveals that it was once a man named Surito Carito, one of countless Nymians transformed by a mysterious sickness, and imprisoned within the Wanderer's Palace by their own countrymen. Like his fellow Nymians, Surito was driven mad by his fate─until you returned with his dear companion Lily and cleansed him of his rancor. This shocking revelation has doubtless affected the marauders, so it may be wise to see how they are faring."
3,"TEXT_JOBSCH500_01102_SEQ_03","After exchanging a few words, the three marauders depart for Limsa Lominsa, leaving you alone with Surito Carito, the scholar turned tonberry. Seek the wisdom of your predecessor."
4,"TEXT_JOBSCH500_01102_SEQ_04","Alas, the sickness which transformed Surito Carito has rendered him incapable of summoning Lily. By what providence you came to possess his Soul of the Scholar he does not know, but he is nevertheless pleased to see his dear companion in good hands. Declaring that only you are fit to wield the magicks now, he bequeaths to you a scholar's gown, as well as knowledge of the spell Sacred Soil. He then bids you farewell, embarking on a quest to rid his countrymen of their rancor. Carry on the traditions of your Nymian colleagues and share your scholarly gifts with the people of Eorzea!

※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"
