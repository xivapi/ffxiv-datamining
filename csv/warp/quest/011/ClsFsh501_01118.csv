1,"TEXT_CLSFSH501_01118_SEQ_01","The recent sighting of a gigantic sea serpent off the coast of La Noscea has prompted the Maelstrom to ban all fishing until further notice. Sisipu has bid you speak with Sybell, who may possess more information, as the Brugaire Consortium has close ties to the Maelstrom."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH501_01118_SEQ_02","Sybell relates to you the legend of Swallowtail Roam, in which Llymlaen imprisoned a fearsome sea serpent that threatened to flood the whole of creation, thus giving rise to the Lominsan motto “till sea swallows all.” Though it is unlikely that the serpent spotted was the beast of eld, it has nevertheless sparked a panic to which the Maelstrom has been forced to respond. To discern the true nature of the beast, Sybell suggests seeking out the source of the sea serpent rumors, Chuchuroon."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH501_01118_SEQ_03","Chuchuroon mentions having shared his story with Wawalago, who has a demonstrated knack for deciphering the Qiqirn's observations. Speak with the netmaster and see what he has to say."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH501_01118_SEQ_04","Wawalago believes a Mazlaya marlin can clear up the misunderstanding. However, the act of catching one will require double mooching, one of the most difficult techniques a fisher<If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> can employ. Use a goby ball to catch a quality harbor herring along north Bloodshore, recast the herring to catch an ogre barracuda, then recast the barracuda to at last catch a Mazlaya marlin. Once accomplished, deliver your prize to Sisipu at the Fishermen's Guild."
5,"TEXT_CLSFSH501_01118_SEQ_05","You and your associates meet with Grand Storm Marshal Eynzahr Slafyrsyn aboard one of the Brugaire Consortium's vessels, where you present to him the Mazlaya marlin. The grand storm marshal subsequently reveals that while he never believed the rumors to be true, he required evidence before he could lift the ban─evidence which you so skillfully acquired. Having put an end to the sea serpent panic, speak with Sisipu to hear her thoughts on what has transpired."
6,"TEXT_CLSFSH501_01118_SEQ_06","Sisipu is uncharacteristically grateful and complimentary, noting that you have saved the Lominsan fishing industry from financial ruin at the hands of an imaginary sea serpent. She is especially pleased by what she believes might be your single greatest contribution to the Fishermen's Guild: luring Wawalago back to work.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"

55,"TEXT_CLSFSH501_01118_SYBELL_000_012","But it would not stop. To prevent the world from being completely submerged, the Navigator trapped the serpent in a floating island with the warning that if it were ever to be freed, the seas would rise until the world ended.
