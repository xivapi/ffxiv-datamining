1,"TEXT_CLSFSH351_01115_SEQ_01","The merchant Tocktix has returned to the Fishermen's Guild once more, this time in search of a desert catfish, which is a key ingredient in one of his favorite dishes. Unaware how a fisher might pull anything from sand, Sisipu recommends that you seek out U'goromuli, a dunefishing acquaintance of Tocktix's and a resident of Forgotten Springs in southern Thanalan."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH351_01115_SEQ_02","Though she would never eat desert catfish herself, U'goromuli is more than happy to assist you. She advises you to seek out a fishing hole east of Byregot's Strike, near an Amalj'aa encampment, and use sand leeches to catch your quarry. Once acquired, deliver the fish to Tocktix outside the Fishermen's Guild."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH351_01115_SEQ_03","Tocktix is ecstatic to receive his prized gourmet catfish. He promptly informs you that he shall waste no time in taking it to the Bismarck, where he has reserved a table for one after closing.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 40."
