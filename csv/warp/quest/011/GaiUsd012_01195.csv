6,"TEXT_GAIUSD012_01195_SEQ_06","You deliver the ritual focus to Urianger, and the scholarly Elezen surmises that Garuda's enhanced powers are likely the result of an altered rite of summoning. Doubting the Ixal's willingness to meddle with the traditional ritual, Urianger suspects the involvement of the chaos-breeding Ascians.
