2,"TEXT_SUBPST021_00241_SEQ_02","Drest's reaction is not exactly what one would call enlightening, but it certainly lives up to the postmoogle's fanfare. Signed, “The Ones You Killed,” the letter calls the hermit “Dashing Drest” and asks a singular question: “Do you dream of rain?” Reflect on it while you retrieve Drest's precious leather sack from Raincatcher Gully."

You suspect that what happened on a rainy night three years ago was but the last straw, and the tragedy began when Garlemald set its sights on Drest's homeland... But that story is for another day."
