3,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_SEQ_03","Lavishing your ratatouille with praise, Latisha goes on to tell you of her responsibilities as the Bismarck's bookkeeper. As is the case with most other professions, it appears that speed is of the essence if one wishes to maintain a well-run restaurant.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 40."

49,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LYNGSATH_000_001","But as any scholarly would tell ye, the learnin' never stops, an' I speak from experience. There's some as say I'm the best in the realm, but there ain't a day what passes that I don't discover somethin' new."

52,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_010","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, the chef who prepared Lord Lolorito's meal in the guildmaster's stead! Thanks to your heroics, the Bismarck's reputation came through unscathed. We all owe you for that. So, what brings you to my counter?"
53,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_011","Master Lyngsath would have you learn about the restaurant business at large, you say? Why, of course! It would be my pleasure to share with you such knowledge as I possess."

59,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_023","In fact, you have just witnessed one of my more important duties: keeping track of our members' progress. I've found that sampling each person's rendition of ratatouille gives a marvelous insight into their growth."
60,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_024","Owing to its simplicity, the vegetable sauté lends itself well to variation, allowing the chef to pour himself into its creation. Indeed, your own bespeaks your ability to create a quality dish under strict time constraints."
61,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_025","Do not underestimate that skill. You'll find a great deal of a restaurant's success lies in performing tasks expeditiously. As an example, some other services I provide are procuring ingredients, ensuring our equipment functions, and, perhaps most importantly, listening to our customers."
62,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_026","If any of these tasks were ignored for an extended period, it is fair to say the Bismarck would fall into chaos, and our name would lose its considerable luster."
