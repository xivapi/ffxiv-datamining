1,"TEXT_BANPIX003_03685_SEQ_01","You can't blame a pixie for trying, and try Tyr Beq does to woo you into living with them in Lyhe Mheg. Having experienced no joy, they head into Lyhe Mheg to arrange a meeting with the little boy whose nightmare you vanquished in Wright, and you and Ezel follow after them.

※You may enter Lyhe Mheg by speaking with Thon Sul in Lydha Lran.

3,"TEXT_BANPIX003_03685_SEQ_03","Satisfied that the dreams of Kholusia are secure, Tyr Beq suggests next investigating nightmares in Amh Araeng. Based on Ezel's preliminary sniffing, the smell appears to be concentrated in the settlement of Mord Souq, and thither do you make your way."
4,"TEXT_BANPIX003_03685_SEQ_04","Arriving in scorching, sand-scoured Mord Souq, you begin your search for a child locked in an unnatural slumber."
5,"TEXT_BANPIX003_03685_SEQ_05","Your search brings you to a little boy tossing and turning in his sleep, the absence of a scent marking him as the source. His father hints at a tragedy that befell his daughter, but he is reluctant to talk about the incident in detail. When the man departs on an errand, Ezel proceeds to devour the boy's nightmare, prompting An Lad to appear once more. The pixie sternly warns you against further interference before leaving you with more cryptic words. Ezel then flies off to find a suitable place to be sick and you hurry after, ready to strike down the nightmare given form."

8,"TEXT_BANPIX003_03685_SEQ_08","Finally awakening, the boy looks at you as if still seeing a dream. It is revealed that he had been tormented by the death of his little sister, who had succumbed to thirst in the desert. Your victory over his nightmare has allowed him to find peace, but as he leaves, you are surprised to hear him give thanks to a pale pixie. Ironically, it appears that it was the existence of the nightmare itself, planted by An Lad, that brought him hope. Given yet more to ponder, you turn your steps back to Lyhe Mheg."
9,"TEXT_BANPIX003_03685_SEQ_09","Arriving back in Lyhe Mheg, you waste no time lifting the seal over the gate to Amh Araeng, thereby reclaiming the dreams of another region."

11,"TEXT_BANPIX003_03685_SEQ_11","Talking about An Lad, Tyr Beq tells you that they can't help but feel as if they know them. Though they fall short of saying it, they seem to believe that the pale pixie may be a reincarnation of their departed best friend, whom they reveal later became the previous Titania. While uncertainty remains over An Lad's identity, for now Tyr Beq decides to focus on doing something fun and productive, namely filling Amh Araeng with happy dreams."
