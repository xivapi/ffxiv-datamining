55,"TEXT_LUCKMG109_03681_CHAINUZZ_000_032","As for where to do it... If we're to accommodate everyone who might feasibly wish to attend, I suppose the only place large enough would be the Emergent."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMG109_03681_WRENDEN_000_033","Then I will go and spread the word among the citizens─both free and bonded─that they are to assemble there to meet their new mayor."

69,"TEXT_LUCKMG109_03681_CHAINUZZ_000_121","Stirred them to action, I hope. If I have learned anything from all of this, it is that change begins with the individual."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMG109_03681_CHAINUZZ_000_122","'Tis but a matter of finding the strength to take the first step."
