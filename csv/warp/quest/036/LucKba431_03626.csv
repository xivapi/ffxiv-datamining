1,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_SEQ_01","Taynor shares with you the memories that have finally returned to him. As the boy tells it, he and Nyelbert were born over a century ago as scions to a consortium of powerful mages, the leaders of which sought to master the art of opening portals to other worlds, that they might summon powerful entities from beyond. To that end, they were tutored in the arcane arts from an early age, their skills employed in dangerous experiments. One day, one of these experiments went awry, and Taynor was sucked into a rift between worlds, where he remained until you rescued him. Due to vagaries of travel between worlds largely beyond your comprehension, what felt like a relatively short span of time for the boy amounted to some one hundred years in the world he had left behind. Taynor shares with you another piece of fortunate news─along with his memories, he has also begun to recall the incantations he had learned─incantations which might serve you well in your confrontation with Phronesis. You and Cerigg set out for the Fields of Amber, where you intend to keep the boy safe as he puts his spells to the test."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_SEQ_02","The boy succeeds in opening a portal to other worlds, if only for fleeting moments, before you are paid a sudden and shocking visit by the fearsome sin eater who is your quarry. Taynor succeeds in pushing away one of Phronesis's hollows and saving Cerigg from a fearsome fate, when suddenly the power of the Echo grants you a vision of the past. You bear witness to yet another vision from a century prior, wherein a youthful Nyelbert begrudgingly lends his strength to the warrior Ardbert and his band to fell a dreadful bovine beast that has risen up from the bowels of the earth to wreak havoc on dwarven mines. What course did the battle take so many years ago?"
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_SEQ_03","The companions having triumphed over the great beast, Nyelbert confesses that he wished to claim the sorcerous stone in the fiend's possession and harness its energies to save his friend Taynor, but ends up tearfully destroying the stone when it is revealed that failing to do so would destroy the mountain and put countless lives in danger. In the end, he joins up with the party of adventurers in earnest, with Ardbert promising to stay by Nyelbert's side until they can together find a way to return Taynor to this world─a happy ending that, sadly, was not to be. You regain consciousness back in the present with Phronesis nowhere to be found, and Cerigg and Taynor clearly concerned for your well-being. Together, you decide to return to Mord Souq, so that you might recuperate and share with your friends all you have learned."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_SEQ_04","Hearing your tale of the visions you saw, and recalling his own experience locking gazes with Phronesis on the battlefield, Taynor is at long last able to accept and make peace with the knowledge that the sin eater and Nyelbert are indeed one and the same. He resolves to join you and Cerigg in your quest to bring Phronesis down, that his old friend might finally know peace. Together, the three of you vow to redouble your training efforts, that you will be fully prepared for the confrontation that lies ahead.

※The next role quest will be available from Cerigg upon reaching level 78 in any magical ranged DPS class."

51,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_010","As time goes by, memories of my earlier days return to me piece by piece."
52,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_011","Nyelbert and I were born to members of a great consortium of mages. From our earliest years, we were tutored in the magical arts by some of the realm's greatest scholars."
53,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_012","The consortium's leaders sought to find a way to open a hole in time and space─a portal to other worlds from which they could summon forth beasts of great power. Nyelbert and I were chosen to participate in the research."
54,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_CERIGG_000_013","Summoning great beasts from beyond our world? You're a mage, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>...is that even possible?"

58,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_CERIGG_000_020","Voidsent? Never heard of them, but I'll take that answer as a yes. Mages come up with the damndest ideas, eh? And yet, I don't understand. Whyever would they use two young boys for such a dangerous experiment?"
59,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_CERIGG_000_025","Indeed. Even were it possible, I shudder to think of the nightmares that would emerge from beyond the rift. Furthermore, I don't understand─whyever would they use two young boys for such a dangerous experiment?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_030","The beasts our masters sought to summon reside in the planes most distant from our own. Reaching across such a great distance requires a tremendous store of innate aetherial power."
61,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_031","And so our masters set about to breed the perfect mage. Marriages were arranged to wed the mightiest members of the consortium to one another, in hopes that they would bring forth children of theretofore unheard-of magical aptitude. Finally, they succeeded..."
62,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_CERIGG_000_032","And so you were born...and Nyelbert."
63,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_033","...Indeed. From even before we could speak, we were taught the complex incantations required to breach the boundaries between worlds."
64,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_034","We practiced these spells day after day, night after night for what seemed an eternity. At long last, we were deemed ready to attempt the summoning."
65,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_035","Sadly, the experiment ended in failure. The pull from beyond the rift was too strong to resist, and I was sucked into a hollow of my own creation."

67,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_CERIGG_000_037","That's the one thing I still don't understand. If so many years have truly passed, why is it that you have not aged even a whit?"
68,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_038","I cannot say for certain. But I remember the words of one of my teachers. “The rift is not unlike a border between countless worlds─a place that exists beyond time and space.”"
69,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_039","If it is true that the rift exists outside of our concept of time, then it is all too possible that even seconds spent in that empty pocket could correspond to months, years, or decades in our world."
70,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_CERIGG_000_040","And so you've returned to us just as you were that day, even while over a century has passed for the rest of us."

72,"TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_TAYNOR_000_042","I fear that would be close to impossible. Opening the portal and reaching as far into the rift as we did required all of our energies to be focused in unison."
