50,"TEXT_LUCKYR004_03605_LORFEO_000_003","Well now, isn't this a pleasant surprise! I've a proposal I was meaning to put to you, as it happens. Interested?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKYR004_03605_LORFEO_000_004","So these skywatchers you see all over─they're good at what they do, but even they can't tell you if it's raining or whatever back on the Source, no?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKYR004_03605_LORFEO_000_005","But with my help, they could! Aye, aye! I could cross the rift, see what the weather's like for myself, come back, and share my knowledge with these mortals by whispering to them in their dreams!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKYR004_03605_LORFEO_000_006","I could do the same for the skywatchers on the other side, too! Everyone would have all the answers, and they wouldn't even know how they'd got them! Mwahahaha! Wouldn't that be grand?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKYR004_03605_LORFEO_000_007","Your silence is all the approval I need. Off I go! Hehehe!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKYR004_03605_SYSTEM_000_008","Due to Lor Feo meddling with the dreams of skywatchers in the Source and the First, skywatchers may now provide forecasts for every region regardless of their location."
