1,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_01","Ahead of the coming trials, Urianger bids you take your ease while the others carry out the work on the Ladder."
2,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_02","As you observe the final stages of the Ladder's restoration, Emet-Selch arrives unannounced. In the course of waxing sentimental, he raises the prospect of you joining him as an equal─a complete existence in a complete world. No sooner does the Ascian take his leave than Ardbert appears in his place. As the Talos come to life to hearty cheers, he speaks to you of his struggles against solitude, and warns you against making a choice that leaves you alone. At that moment, Alphinaud and Alisaie rush up to you excitedly. The Ladder lives again, and you join the twins as the first souls to ride the lift in twenty years."
3,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_03","While you await the others at Top Rung, Alisaie calls to you from the nearby outlook, and you and Alphinaud hurry to join her."
4,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_04","According to Alisaie, she witnessed someone emerge from the village to the northeast, even though the area is believed to have been abandoned. Lest you doubt her words, she urges you to take a look for yourself."
5,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_05","Scanning the area around the village, you spot the mysterious person, who appeared to be spying in your direction. Uncomfortable at not knowing who is out there, Alisaie suggests that you investigate the village."
6,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_06","While the village appears devoid of people, there is evidence to suggest that it is very much inhabited, and you take your findings to Alphinaud."
7,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_07","As you ponder what to do about the hiding villagers, a voice calls out. It is revealed to belong to none other than Tristol, the young artist whose life you saved in Kholusia. He informs you that the village, Amity, is a settlement for those who survived being exiled from Eulmore, and upon learning that you are in pursuit of Vauthry, promises to aid you in your quest."

56,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_URIANGER_000_040","Ah, but prematurely do I give myself to sentimental musings. Many more pressing concerns demand our attention, not the least of which is the matter of how we might reach the mountain, detached from the land as it is."
57,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_URIANGER_000_041","For the present, 'twould appear we have matters here well in hand. Perhaps thou shouldst take thine ease for a time? Thou wilt need every onze of thy strength for the trials ahead."

66,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALPHINAUD_000_080","That appears to be a village..."
67,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALISAIE_000_090","There's a village, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Over to the northeast."
68,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALPHINAUD_000_091","So there is. Yet after two decades without the Ladder in operation, I would not be surprised if such an isolated settlement had long since been abandoned."
69,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALISAIE_000_092","Nor I. But that was before I spied someone leave it and proceed to head in our direction, all the while trying to remain unseen..."
70,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALISAIE_000_093","Whoever this mysterious person is, they should still be out there. Go on and take a look, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."

75,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALPHINAUD_000_112","I'm curious too, I must admit. And I daresay we have a bit of time ere the others ascend."
76,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALISAIE_000_113","It's settled, then. Let's head to the village and see if it's indeed inhabited."

93,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_TRISTOL_000_147","You remembered! Ever since we parted ways, I've worried for you, bound for the city as you were. Never did I imagine that we would meet again, and here of all places!"
94,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALPHINAUD_000_148","We could say the very same thing to you, my friend. I'm glad to see you hale and whole. But tell me, what is this village?"
95,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_TRISTOL_000_149","This is Amity, a settlement made up of those who survived being exiled from Eulmore."
96,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_TRISTOL_000_150","As I wandered the wilds, I chanced to cross paths with an inhabitant of these parts."
97,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_TRISTOL_000_151","He took me through a secret tunnel which led to the top of the Bright Cliff. I've been here ever since. Life is hard, but we know a semblance of peace."

103,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_TRISTOL_000_157","I owe you my life. If there is anything I can do to help, you need but say the word."
104,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALPHINAUD_000_158","Your help would be most welcome, Tristol. To begin with, we request your people's permission to reconnoiter the area."
105,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_ALPHINAUD_000_159","If we are to confront Vauthry, we must find a way to reach Mt. Gulg."
106,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_TRISTOL_000_160","Of course, you hardly need our permission to be here. I will tell the others about you and yours."
