The evidence of this is represented most aptly, perhaps, by our ability to manifest the arcane entity Carbuncle, and the manner of magic which this aetherial ally employs at our command."
55,"TEXT_CLSACN020_00453_THUBYRGEIM_000_022","The core of the discipline, however, is found in the pursuit of definitive solutions to any potential quandary. Even on the field of battle─nay, <Emphasis>especially</Emphasis> on the field of battle─this principle takes precedence."
