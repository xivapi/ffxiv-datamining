9,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SEQ_09","At last, Sylphie has felt the embrace of nature and is ready to set forth upon the path of conjury alone. Observing that your experiences alongside the young conjurer have served to deepen your own understanding of the art, Brother E–Sumi rewards you with the potent healing spell Cure II. Though your tutelage under the guildmaster has come to an end, your journey as a conjurer continues ever onwards."

87,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_68","Indeed, Gridania is indebted to you for your heroic deeds. The corruption born of Akoman had taken root in the Calamity-weakened soil─there is no telling how much further it might have spread if you had not defeated the creature."
88,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_69","And if I am not mistaken, Sylphie, you succeeded in drawing upon the energies of nature during the battle."

90,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_71","That is as it should be. One does not simply <Emphasis>choose</Emphasis> to borrow from nature's strength.

93,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_74","I have no doubt that it will serve you well in your continuing endeavors. Wheresoever you go, nature will go with you, my friend. Ever shall the earth meet your footfall, and the wind guide your path."
