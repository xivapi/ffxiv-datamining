※This quest is available for a limited time only."

Rendezvous with the troubled trader outside the Quicksand, where he will meet you after taking a walk to settle his troubled mind."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY101_00499_SEQ_03","You meet with Nanapasi outside the Quicksand, where the flustered father explains his plight in detail. As he tells it, he sought to take advantage of this year's Little Ladies' Day festivities to repair a strained relationship with his daughter Ninimo, promising the girl that he would oversee the construction of a modern-day replica of the Thorne Dynasty decorations that she has long adored. Unfortunately, failing to exercise due diligence before he spoke, he now finds himself without the materials he needs to see his words become reality. Pleading for assistance, he entrusts you with an ancient map and directs you to speak with the disciplined domestic beside him if you are willing to offer your aid."
