1,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_01","Rather than attempting to retrace Solkzagyl's steps, Constaint has decided that it would be better to simply pursue Death's Embrace, as they are the ones in possession of Oathkeeper. Before he embarks upon this venture, however, there is one matter he would like to discuss with Hundred Eyes, the man who buried his master..."
2,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_02","Constaint begins to question Hundred Eyes about his master's death, but the craftsman brusquely refuses to answer, stating simply that he buried him, and that he needs not know anything else. The boy apologizes for asking and leaves to seek out someone who might know the whereabouts of Death's Embrace."
3,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_03","According to Emerissel, the assassins-turned-bandits have not been seen in western Coerthas for quite some time. Upon learning that the men you seek are Ul'dahn, the Ishgardian is inspired to regale you with a tale of southron idiocy, namely a gang of Ul'dahns who managed to sneak aboard the airships which travel regularly to Camp Cloudtop. The Ul'dahns then attempted to seize the <Emphasis>Protector</Emphasis>, despite the fact that the airship is not fit for travel. Suspecting this to be a serendipitous coincidence─and having no other leads whatsoever─Constaint suggests that you go and investigate the incident at Camp Cloudtop."
4,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_04","House Haillenarte is preparing to hunt down the bandits responsible for the attack, and your assistance with the operation is more than welcome. Join the assembled knights at the Rosehouse."
5,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_05","Having learned of House Haillenarte's plans, the Ul'dahns have fled to the east. The commanding officer bids everyone advance with caution, as these are dangerous men desperate to survive."
6,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_06","Though the knights manage some success against the former assassins, you must nevertheless come to their aid. One search party is no longer in danger, but the other is nowhere to be seen..."
7,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_07","Constaint and his search party are able to defeat most of the remaining enemies, but they are unable to subdue the bandits' leader. You, however, have no such trouble. Afterwards, you are surprised to discover a pair of gallant gauntlets amongst the man's possessions..."
8,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_08","The House Haillenarte knight thanks you for your contribution and leaves to inform Lady Laniaitte of your success. Constaint is beaming with pride, yet how will he react when you show him the gauntlets you found?"
9,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_09","Constaint is at a loss. There is no possible explanation for how the gauntlets came to be in the assassin's possession. That they were cannot be denied, however...so what could it possibly mean?"
10,"TEXT_JOBPLD580_02036_SEQ_10","Given the manner in which they have been struggling to survive, Constaint is forced to conclude that Death's Embrace no longer has Oathkeeper. Surely they would have sold it rather than resort to banditry, he considers. Yet even more disconcerting are the gallant gauntlets, which fit Constaint perfectly─as he suspected they would...
