1,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_01","The voice, some say, is a beacon, guiding the dark knight to <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> true calling. As you grow more accustomed to drawing upon your darkside, you will come to hear the voice more clearly. Such are Fray's words to you when you ask <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> of the voice. Communion will hasten this process, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> continues─but it cannot be conducted in Ishgard. Journey with Fray to Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_02","“I want you to kill something for me,” Fray asks. “Something fearsome, which will push you to your limits.” <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> wants to watch you thrive in that moment. And you want to show <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. Gundobald should know of a suitable creature."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_03","It saddens you to see how weak and complacent Gundobald has grown, and how his cowardice has spread amongst his people. They fear to tread near the lairs of mere peistes. But you do not. At least he furnished you with aldgoat meat for bait."
4,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_04","Fray stands apart, waiting for you to show <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> who you are. Find a suitable location for the bait."
5,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_05","You feel <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> eyes upon you, expectant. Hungry─like yours. Where are those godsdamned peistes...?"
6,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_06","A dead peiste lies at your feet, and you feel alive. Somehow, you know Fray is smiling."
7,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_07","To mete out justice, one must be strong─a simple truth which you already knew, of course. You are ready for communion, but it will not be conducted here. South of Little Ala Mhigo─Fray is waiting for you there."
8,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_08","Fray bids you approach and begin the rite of communion. Close your eyes and hold out your hand. Breathe deep through your nose─let the air fill your lungs, then let it pass from your lips. Slower, slower..."
9,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_09","In the abyss, a wanderer's voice sings to you. Forever moving, without rest or respite... Though its meaning yet eludes you, Fray tells you not to be discouraged, further adding that it might belong to an individual whom you are fated to seek out. If so, none can say how long it might take to find them...but the mere thought of the journey stirs something within you...

※The next dark knight quest will be available from Fray upon reaching level 40."
