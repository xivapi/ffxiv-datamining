1,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_01","Before unveiling his grand theory, Alphinaud would adjourn to a more appropriate location─specifically, the southern shore of Loch Seld."
2,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_02","After favoring you with a short lecture on the history of Loch Seld, Alphinaud posits that the “darkness beneath the palace” referred to by Ernold may contain the submerged remnants of the ancient city of Skalla. He further theorizes that Theodoric had his kinsmen cursed and cast into the depths not only to punish them for their imagined crimes, but to have them serve as guardians over his treasures. Whilst Alphinaud and Arenvald search for a way into the ruins from above, you are to scour the loch bed for an underwater entrance."
3,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_03","In the frigid waters of Loch Seld, you discover a passage leading directly beneath the palace foundations. Such a find warrants further investigation..."
4,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_04","You have discovered a stone door which appears to offer a way into the ruins beneath the palace. Enter the Drowned City of Skalla, and search for the mad king's trove!

※The Drowned City of Skalla can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
5,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_05","You have defeated the monstrous denizens of Skalla. The fabled treasure must surely lie nearby..."
6,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_06","As you gaze upon the riches of the mad king's trove, Alphinaud and Arenvald tumble in from a different section of the ruins. Return to the Ala Mhigan Quarter, and recount your respective adventures."
7,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_07","With grudging admiration, Alphinaud declares you the victor of the impromptu race to the treasure. Arenvald, meanwhile, seems more intent on teasing Alphinaud for his reaction to one of the ruins' ghostly inhabitants..."

54,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_021","Prior to the great flood of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, the salt lakes you see before you were yet dry ravines. And this, believe it or not, was the site of the ancient city of Skalla, which rose and fell during the Fifth Astral Era."
55,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_022","From what we know of the period, the city was already deserted by the time the waters began to rise, having been all but destroyed by war. Yet its ruins remain to this day at the bottom of Loch Seld."
56,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_023","It is my belief that the “darkness beneath the palace” mentioned by Theodoric's former scribe was not a reference to the prison, but to a place still further below: the ruins of Skalla."
57,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_024","I further surmise that the mad king's unfortunate kinsmen were cast down there not simply out of a desire to punish them, but to discourage exploration. Theodoric wanted to keep the ruins secure..."

59,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_026","Precisely. And since we know the court thaumaturge was involved, we can safely assume that any entrance into the old city will have been magically concealed."
60,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ARENVALD_000_027","...Which would explain how a legion of imperial soldiers and the gods know how many Ala Mhigans never found a trace of the trove."

65,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_042","(-Alphinaud's Voice-)...And you believe it leads into the ruins? Excellent. Then I propose we proceed from our respective entry points and look to meet somewhere in the middle."
