2,"TEXT_JOBNIN680_02951_SEQ_02","You and Jacke come upon Oboro under the falling waters of the Heron's Flight. As he dries himself off by the fire, the ninja shares with you just what has been troubling him so. As he tells it, he was given a hero's welcome upon his return to the village, but recent events have left him unable to accept the praise lavished upon him. Jacke comforts him with a tale of your own adventures, the moral of which is that when people give you more credit than you deserve, you might as well take it as an opportunity to better yourself rather than beating yourself up for your perceived failings. With newfound resolve, Oboro declares his intention to learn the secret history of Sasuke, his village's founder, from the old hermit known as Master Kamui. Return to Namai, where Tsubame has prepared a most majestic means of transportation for your journey."

8,"TEXT_JOBNIN680_02951_SEQ_08","You return to Plum Spring to find Master Kamui in fine fettle, some time in the company of the lovely Tsubame having clearly done the work of the most potent of elixirs. His spirits high, he regales you with the true story of Master Sasuke, he who brought ninjutsu to Doma and founded the village Oboro and his fellow shinobi call home. Long ago, Sasuke sailed across the Ruby Sea to Doma at the bidding of his master, Hanzo the First. Hanzo entrusted his young protégé with a scroll writ with the forbidden mudra of summoning he had devised, commanding him to use it to free the Doman people from tyranny. Sasuke did just that, and then─fearing the mudra's power─cleaved the scroll in two, that the fearsome knowledge contained within never again would see the light of day. At the same time, he founded a village, that he might train his new countrymen in the art of ninjutsu, and pass his legacy on to future generations. Sadly, as his mission─even at the time─was shrouded in the utmost of secrecy, Sasuke's heroic deeds on behalf of Doma never reached the ears of his clansmen, and centuries later, it would seem that the descendants of the Kagekakushi clan have come to see him as a traitor and deserter who stole away to a foreign land with his master's forbidden knowledge. As Oboro puts the pieces together, Princess Yuki and Jacke arrive bearing grave news. The Kagekakushi clan means to sail for Doma to claim what they believe is rightly theirs─and when they come, they will come with an army."

You resolve to devote all your efforts to your training, knowing that you and your friends will be tested as never before.
