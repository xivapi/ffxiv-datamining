1,"TEXT_SUBPST019_00036_SEQ_01","The prince of the bloodsands, Franz the Fair, is a regular recipient of copious amounts of fan mail. In recognition of your service to the moogle delivery service, the honor of delivering this day's batch has been awarded to you. Franz is training for an upcoming Coliseum match and can likely be found at the Gladiators' Guild in Ul'dah."
2,"TEXT_SUBPST019_00036_SEQ_02","A popular gladiator must contend with threats both inside and outside the Coliseum─a truth which becomes apparent when a morbol seedling emerges from one of the missives addressed to Franz. The gladiator's comrades suspect one of their own, a former noxius named Langloisiert, may be responsible, but their lanista, Bubudoga, is convinced that other gladiators are responsible. Bubudoga also believes that the culprits may attempt to masquerade as fans to gain access to Franz and do him harm. Therefore, the lanista bids you surreptitiously investigate fans in the Coliseum and on the Steps of Nald by first posting placards and distributing flyers and then observing their reactions."
3,"TEXT_SUBPST019_00036_SEQ_03","Gladiatorial combat attracts an eclectic crowd, but none you encounter appear to bear Franz ill will. Nevertheless, there is a nervous energy in the air which cannot be put down to mere pre-match excitement, and you feel eyes upon you on several occasions.

7,"TEXT_SUBPST019_00036_SEQ_07","It would seem that U'linbho was too quick to presume malicious intent on the part of Langloisiert. The former noxius had long made a habit of watching over Franz, for fear of his rivals attacking in reprisal. Alas, on this occasion, Langloisiert and Silent Moss were unable to subdue the masked gladiators stalking Franz, and the two wounded companions bid you protect their beauteous comrade in their stead. Seek out Franz and his pursuers in central Thanalan."

Fearing that his fame was the product of Syndicate machinations, the young gladiator goaded his less scrupulous opponents to attack him outside the Coliseum, so that he might at last learn whether or not his reputation was legitimate. Now aware of his secret intentions, his comrades scold him for doubting the validity of his accomplishments, and convince him that the prince of the bloodsands, the pride of Ul'dah, the suave southern dandy is anything but a fraud. The party subsequently departs for their upcoming match, after which they will return to Halatali, where they will eagerly welcome you should you choose to join their training."
