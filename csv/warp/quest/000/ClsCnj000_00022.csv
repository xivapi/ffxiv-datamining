50,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_MADELLE_000_3","It takes unwavering conviction to become a conjurer. After all, if you are not ready to embrace nature fully, you cannot expect nature to embrace you. Ponder these words, and return here again when you are certain you wish to walk our path."

56,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_12","Before you are formally accepted into our ranks, I would impart to you the principles of conjury. Pray attend me well."
57,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_13","Conjury is an arcane art that takes life and the living for its domain. Its primary purpose is the salving of hurts and the granting of protection."
58,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_14","Adventurers such as yourself oft stand upon the front lines of battle. Owing to this, you are like to find yourself in many situations wherein a capacity for healing would be advantageous. Mind you, there is more to conjury than that."
59,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_15","By harnessing the power of earth, wind, and water, conjurers are also capable of weaving spells that wreak havoc."
60,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_16","In terms of sheer destructive power, conjury may pale in comparison to thaumaturgy, but its capacity to defend one against aggression more than compensates for this relative shortcoming."
61,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_17","In mastering healing and purification, not only will you be able to mend wounds and purge afflictions─you will also be able to breathe life back into the fallen."
62,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_18","More than simply healers, yet not true dealers of destruction, conjurers realize their full potential when they employ their powers in support of others. This, my dear adventurer, is what it means to be one of us."
63,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_19","...Hm, mayhap that was too much to grasp upon a single hearing. But worry not, for the meaning of my words will become clear to you in due time."
64,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_20","Aye, you will come to understand that conjury is not the sole province of the conjurer."
65,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_21","Should you wish to walk our path, I must needs ask that you solemnly vow to embrace nature─to heed the will of the elementals and the Twelveswood alike. Can you make this vow?"

70,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_26","So long as doubt clouds your heart, you will not be able to draw on the power of the elements. Search your soul, and seek me again when you have resolved to become as one with nature."
71,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_30","I knew your answer ere your lips had parted. Yet I am no less pleased to hear it."

74,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_33","Just beyond the city gates, you will encounter squirrels, ladybugs, and funguars. I would have you slay three of each."
75,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_34","Lest you wonder how I can so coolly order the taking of life, know that things are not as they once were. As a consequence of the Calamity─and, I may add, through no fault of their own─these creatures have become a burden to the Twelveswood. A burden it cannot well bear."
76,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_35","As a conjurer, it is your duty to carry out the will of the forest. And by employing your powers in so doing, you will come to learn something of your art."

80,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_42","Healing, protection, and destruction... Though our spells vary in function, they all derive their power from the same source─the forces embodied in all creation."
81,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_43","By gaining a true understanding of these, a conjurer may call upon them to manipulate his environment, thereby realizing the state of being that he desires."
82,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_44","Ah, yes...yours is a familiar look: the very picture of confusion! Be not disheartened, for comprehension shall come in due time."

84,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_46","Pray receive of me this hunting log. Within you will find the names of such creatures as would pose a suitable challenge to a conjurer."
85,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_47","There is no single path to mastering conjury. Yet should you find yourself needing direction, know that the log is there to guide you."
86,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_48","Breathe deep and open your eyes to that which cannot be seen. Feel the myriad life around you, and draw upon this boundless reservoir of energy. Take up your cane, and use it to lend that energy form."
87,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_49","Go forth, my young conjurer, and be at one with the world. Return to me when you have learned to draw upon the forces around you with the selfsame ease you draw upon those within."
88,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_SYSTEM_000_60","The next conjurer quest will be available from E–Sumi–Yan upon reaching level 5."
