1,"TEXT_JOBREL011_00357_SEQ_01","The garrulous Papana reveals that she is in Revenant's Toll to free her old associate G'jusana from the shackles of heavy debt. To that end, the bookseller will part with a rare tome which details the Zodiac Weapons, but only if you can furnish her with the following rare items: a Bronze Lake crystal, a Bombard core, and a bottle of sacred spring water. The first of these may be found in the vicinity of the lake of its namesake."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL011_00357_SEQ_02","Having painstakingly obtained the requested items, you return to Papana only to find that their quality is not to her satisfaction. Judging them insufficient payment for the book, Papana further asks you fetch her a horn of the beast which prowls Dzemael Darkhold, and a gobmachine bangplate from Brayflox's Longstop.

※Dzemael Darkhold and Brayflox's Longstop (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_JOBREL011_00357_SEQ_03","Through great effort, you have obtained the goods Papana requested. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll and present them to her."
4,"TEXT_JOBREL011_00357_SEQ_04","Upon returning to Papana, you are told that a wealthy collector seeks to buy the selfsame book you desire, and the competition has driven up the price of exchange. The Lalafellin shopkeep will now settle for nothing less than a Narasimha hide and a sickle fang, highly prized objects found only within Halatali and Snowcloak.

※Halatali (Hard) and Snowcloak can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
5,"TEXT_JOBREL011_00357_SEQ_05","Through sheer perseverance, you have succeeded in obtaining the next set of items Papana has requested. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll, and pray that your toils are finally over."
6,"TEXT_JOBREL011_00357_SEQ_06","Your prayers go unanswered, for Papana has yet another request to make of you. Rowena, the bookseller explains, has tasked her with incinerating those tomes that are unfit to sell, and only when this chore is finished can she turn her attention back to you. If you would obtain your book, suppress your desire to scream, and bring Papana a high-quality furnace ring and a bundle of perfect firewood.

※Certain ingredients required to craft these items can be obtained by desynthesizing aged goods sold at the Silver Bazaar."
7,"TEXT_JOBREL011_00357_SEQ_07","The items for igniting books now in her hands, Papana apologizes for having taken advantage of you. In wistful tones, she tells you of her misspent youth, and of her admiration and respect for G'jusana. Thanking you for your part in helping her dear friend get closer to financial freedom, Papana presents you with the object of your desire: the Book of Skylight. With the knowledge held within, Gerolt may now faithfully recreate such an arm as was wielded by the Zodiac Braves of legend.

※If you have obtained all four items requested by Gerolt, you may return to Hyrstmill to have your Zodiac Weapon forged."
