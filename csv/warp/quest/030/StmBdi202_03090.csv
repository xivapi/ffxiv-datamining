2,"TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_02","Wineport vintner Shamani Lohmani knows of a wine that might tickle your client's fancy, but sadly cannot claim to have a bottle in his cellars. Yet he also knows that if anyone could, it would be his friend and rival (but mostly rival) Byrglaent."
3,"TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_03","One would hope Byrglaent's vintages contain less pith than his reply to your request for a bottle of Suhd Viandja.

4,"TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_04","But of course Master Gegeruju has a bottle of vintage Suhd Viandja, and of course he will not part with it...unless, that is, you bring him a bottle of Dalmascan wine in exchange. As for where to find a wine so rare, only a blind Lalafellin vintner might know. Fortunately, you know just the man."

9,"TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_09","You discover an empty, yet corked, bottle of wine that could be Dalmascan. The blind vintner of Wineport should know more."
10,"TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_10","Thanks in part to the faint scent still lingering on the cork, Shamani Lohmani is able to confirm beyond doubt that Drest's empty bottle did indeed contain Dalmascan wine. Sadly, however, the vintner believes that Gegeruju is unlikely to accept a lingering scent in exchange for the Suhd Viandja. Luckily, Shamani Lohmani is, for once, not the only other soul in the winery, as Hancock of the East Aldenard Trading Company just happens to be visiting Eorzea on business. Having eavesdropped on your conversation, he proceeds to offer up a most wicked solution: fill the empty bottle with a Hingan red and pass it off as a genuine Lea Monde Valens. He even provides you with a bottle of the suggested substitute, free of charge. Though Shamani Lohmani vehemently disapproves, he quite literally turns a blind eye to your brazen act of counterfeiture. All that remains is to make the exchange."
11,"TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_11","Hancock's scheme is a success. Oblivious to the bottle's true content, Gegeruju keeps his end of the bargain and presents you with a bottle of vintage Suhd Viandja rosé."
