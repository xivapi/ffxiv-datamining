1,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_SEQ_01","Alphinaud informs you that a letter has arrived from Lord Hien, and after he helpfully summarizes its contents, you glean that your presence is required at the Doman Enclave. Tataru duly promises to mind the fort while you are away, and as you prepare to leave with Alphinaud and Alisaie, you pause to wonder what will unfold across the Ruby Sea: a declaration of peace between Doma and the Empire...or an all-too-predictable return to hostilities."
2,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_SEQ_02","You meet Lord Hien at the enclave as planned, only to learn that his letter had omitted mention of a worrying incident involving an ailing Gosetsu. Upon visiting the bedridden samurai, however, you are relieved to find him well on the path to recovery. Yotsuyu, meanwhile, seems much the same as when you last saw her─a child in a woman's body.

Some time later, a tale told by Yugiri convinces Lord Hien that Yotsuyu's plight is genuine, and he decides to allow her to live out her days in Doma as “Tsuyu.” The only obstacle remaining is to present proof of her condition to Asahi, and with this in mind, your allies agree to rendezvous at the enclave docks."
3,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_SEQ_03","After an uneventful wait by the skiff, a breathless Lord Hien rushes into view, and it is plain that something is amiss. It seems that Yotsuyu has left the safety of the Kienkan, and according to the testimony of the skiff captain, she has already crossed the river..."

82,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_YUGIRI_000_040","But her mask has never slipped. Not once. She has remained in character from the first. One evening, I watched her as she sat in her chambers, unguarded and alone..."
83,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_YUGIRI_000_041","She had taken the dishes from the cupboard, and was pretending to prepare dinner right there on the tatami. A child's game."

86,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_HIEN_000_044","Aye, the matter is settled. Yotsuyu will become “Tsuyu,” and begin a new life here in Doma."
87,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_HIEN_000_045","Before that can happen, however, we will need to present her to the ambassador one last time, to prove that her memory is truly gone."
88,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_HIEN_000_046","But I would not risk parading her in front of our returning conscripts. Her presence at the exchange would only stir up mutinous thoughts."
89,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_ALISAIE_000_047","Understandably. She as good as fastened the chains around their necks."
90,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_HIEN_000_048","Aye─which is why I mean to conclude this business with Tsuyu first, out of the sight of my countrymen. Will you help me?"

103,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_DOMANFERRYMAN_000_067","Her face was hidden by the brim of her hat, but I remember taking her hand to help her onto the boat. White as new-fallen snow, it was... Was she someone important, my lord? Have I done something wrong?"
104,"TEXT_STMBDD101_03070_HIEN_000_068","Wrong? ...No. No, I was merely hoping to catch our guest before she departed. Be at ease, Captain."
