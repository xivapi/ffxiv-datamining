0,"TEXT_CLSWVR300_00593_SEQ_00","Redolent Rose has a job perfectly suited to your talents."
1,"TEXT_CLSWVR300_00593_SEQ_01","Wawarukka, the miner whose loyal custom Redolent Rose seemed so eager to reward, has approached the guild with another commission. Unusually, however, it would seem he seeks something other than mining gear this time. Speak with Wawarukka to learn the details of his request."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR300_00593_SEQ_02","Wawarukka is smitten with a girl from a wealthy family, and is eager to make a good first impression. To this end, he wishes to purchase the finest pair of velveteen gaiters money can buy. Craft the items to the best of your ability and deliver them to Redolent Rose."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR300_00593_SEQ_03","You discover to your horror that Wawarukka's new gaiters are but a small part of a gruesomely mismatched ensemble. Even as Redolent Rose tries to warn the poor fellow that he's making a terrible mistake, the oblivious Lalafell bounds off to profess his love, leaving the guildmaster to comfort himself with the thought that the unwary lady may yet see past his friend's bizarre appearance. Quite why she would is another question...

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 35."
