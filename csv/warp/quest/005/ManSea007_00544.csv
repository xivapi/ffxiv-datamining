1,"TEXT_MANSEA007_00544_SEQ_01","According to Baderon, the missive intended for Ahtzapfyn is written in Sahagin script, and details plans for the destruction of the <Emphasis>Victory</Emphasis>. Though the message mentions a diversionary strike on Swiftperch, the Wench's proprietor seems convinced that the Serpent Reavers are lying, and that the struggling settlement is their true target. Take Baderon's hastily translated note and deliver it to Commodore Reyner at the Coral Tower."
2,"TEXT_MANSEA007_00544_SEQ_02","Though Reyner is grateful for Baderon's warning, he believes Swiftperch is but one of several settlements which the Serpent Raiders could be planning to attack. While the commodore debates where to deploy his forces, a Yellowjacket arrives bearing word that South Tidegate is being assaulted by the Sahagin. Lacking the resources to defend both locations, Reyner instructs you to make haste to Swiftperch and speak with the Yellowjacket, Ryssfloh."

Return to the Coral Tower and report to Commodore Reyner."
