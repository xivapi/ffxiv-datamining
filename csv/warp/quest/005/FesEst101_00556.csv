※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST101_00556_SEQ_01","Jihli Aliapoh asks that you join her in celebrating the coming of Hatching–tide, a festival born from a vision bestowed on her by the Twelve Archons of yore; a vision that came to reality a twelvemoon prior. However, this year's event is to be no mere memorial, for Jihli has again been visited by the Archons: in her most recent dream, she saw adventurers in spriggan form following an auspicious spriggan, who guided them to a wondrous treasure. She bids you speak with her sylphic helper by the amphitheatre gates, so that you too might be transfigured into the shape of a spriggan, and bring her vision to life.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

She bids you remain in disguise as you hunt for Archon eggs around Old Gridania, and collect three of the cards contained within, that you might exchange them with Jihli for a special prize.

※If the transfiguration should fade, speak with the sylphic sorceress again to be changed back into spriggan form."

She asks how you could have discovered the egg that contained this rarest of prizes, and you relate how an unusual spriggan holding a checkered egg drew your attention to it. Jihli is delighted to hear your news, recognizing the auspicious spriggan from her vision in your words. Convinced once more that the Archons' prophecy is coming true, she asks for your assistance in tracking down the auspicious spriggan, that he might guide you to the wondrous treasure of which the Archons spoke."
