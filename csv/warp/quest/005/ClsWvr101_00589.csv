1,"TEXT_CLSWVR101_00589_SEQ_01","Forgoing explanations, the guildmaster requests that you make him a dozen bolts of undyed hempen cloth <Emphasis>fast</Emphasis>. Craft the required items, and deliver them to him posthaste."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR101_00589_SEQ_02","Though the guildmaster is grateful for your aid in supplying the Immortal Flames' pressing need, he cannot hide his contempt for the adventurers whose irresponsible behavior occasioned it. Happily, the incident did present you with an opportunity to prove your worth, and Redolent Rose is now of the opinion that you are ready to accept commissions from Eustace at the Quicksand.
