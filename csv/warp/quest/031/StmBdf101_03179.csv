1,"TEXT_STMBDF101_03179_SEQ_01","You visit the Rising Stones to find Alisaie at her wit's end. Even as she wonders which of the Scions' mounting problems to tackle first, Krile arrives to bring calm to the situation. After examining the afflicted in the infirmary, Krile comes to the same conclusion as the Elder Seedseer: it's as if the souls of their companions have taken leave of their bodies. She offers to follow the trail of their aether, but to do so will require the use of Master Matoya's Crystal Eye. It seems a trip to the Dravanian hinterlands is in order."

Despite her best efforts, however, it appears that the threads of aether come to an abrupt end. Bemused and dismayed, you decide to focus instead upon the matters of the present. Alisaie has had word from Lyse that members of the Populares have defected from the Empire, and is desperate to learn of Alphinaud's fate."
