Consoled by the fact that he is safe and well cared for, Maxima prepares to take his leave, inviting you to meet with a man he claims to be an acquaintance of yours. "

Your reunion is cut brief when an Alliance soldier arrives bearing a message for the Warrior of Light. Raubahn requests your presence in Ala Mhigo to discuss strategy. To that end, Cid offers you transportation aboard the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>."
