1,"TEXT_SUBFST025_00103_SEQ_01","Q'djawana tells you of how starving opo-opos stole bags of Mun–Tuy beans from Dametta in Hyrstmill. While the pungent beans will not be missed, the normally cheerful and talkative Dametta has fallen into a deep depression. Slay opo-opos on the road to Hyrstmill and recover the six stolen bags of Mun–Tuy beans."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST025_00103_SEQ_02","You serve justice to the thieving, malnourished opo-opos and recover the stolen bags of Mun–Tuy beans. See them delivered to Dametta in Hyrstmill."
