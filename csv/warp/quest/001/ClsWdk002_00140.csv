1,"TEXT_CLSWDK002_00140_SEQ_01","Before you can undertake your final trial, Timbermaster Beatin asks you to help replenish the guild's stock of ash lumber. Deliver twelve lengths to him at the Oak Atrium."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK002_00140_SEQ_02","Grateful for your delivery, Timbermaster Beatin explains that versatility is the secret of ash lumber's enduring popularity. While he still considers you unready for the final trial, he grants you leave to practice your craft independently, and directs you to Gontrant at the Carline Canopy for additional work.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 15."
