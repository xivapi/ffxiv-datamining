1,"TEXT_CLSROG021_00104_SEQ_01","To help you get a feel for your new weapons, Jacke suggests you head to the fields outside Limsa Lominsa and slay some of the local wildlife. Travel to middle La Noscea and defeat three wharf rats, three lost lambs, and three pugils."
2,"TEXT_CLSROG021_00104_SEQ_02","You have slain the requisite creatures. Return to the Rogues' Guild and report to Jacke."
3,"TEXT_CLSROG021_00104_SEQ_03","Jacke welcomes you back from your dagger practice with another nugget of wisdom: in combat, a rogue relies more on agility than brute force. Keep the guildmaster's words in mind as you work on preparing yourself for whatever job Jacke means to give you.

※The next rogue quest will be available from Jacke upon reaching level 5."
