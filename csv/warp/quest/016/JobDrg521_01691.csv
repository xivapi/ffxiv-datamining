1,"TEXT_JOBDRG521_01691_SEQ_01","In hearing of your new technique, Heustienne realizes that she must cast aside her preconceptions if she is to transcend her limits. Though she would continue her lesson, the hour is late and her duties call. Before she leaves, Heustienne extends to you an invitation to visit the home of the dragoons. Make your way back to Ishgard and meet your pupil before the entrance of the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG521_01691_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Congregation's entrance to find Heustienne with her father, Montorgains, a retired dragoon. After her father takes his leave, Heustienne opens up to you about her past. You learn that she is a war orphan, and became a dragoon that she might honor her adoptive father. The tale concludes with Heustienne remembering that Ser Alberic wished a word with you. Take yourself to the Observatorium at your earliest convenience."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG521_01691_SEQ_03","You learn more of Heustienne's past from Ser Alberic. Possessed of tremendous potential, she had once vied to become the Azure Dragoon. Alas, the Eye chose her rival, Estinien, and she has since taken to training with a fervor bordering on self-punishment. Ser Alberic bids you keep watch over her, lest she lose sight of her conviction and render herself vulnerable to the enemy's wiles.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic upon reaching level 54."
