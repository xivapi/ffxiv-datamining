1,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_01","Zhai'a Nelhah has contacted Lalai, requesting your assistance in the investigation into the Defiant. Speak with him at the Quicksand for further details."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_02","The Conjurers' Guild had contacted the many cities of Eorzea, requesting any information that might lead to the apprehension of Waldeve and his dangerous cult. A response has finally come from the Temple Knights of Ishgard. The Defiant have been witnessed at the Holy See. Zhai'a Nelhah knows nothing of this nation and requests your assistance in following up on this sighting. Travel to the Arc of the Worthy in Ishgard and speak with the Temple Knights for more details concerning Waldeve's whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_03","You soon find a Temple Knight, who explains that the Defiant were recently proselytizing in the Holy See. When the Temple Knights moved to stop them, the cultists fled the city. However, the trail has not been lost. Reports now reach the capital that the Defiant have been seen at the Convictory, in the Coerthas western highlands. However, the Convictors do not share the Temple Knights' resolute steadfastness. Travel to the Convictory and stop the Defiant before they can rally these impressionable young soldiers to their cause."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_04","There is no sign of the Defiant at the Convictory. Try asking some of the troops if they have seen any suspicious mages recently."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_05","You question the Convictors and learn that, as best you can tell, none of them were fooled by the Defiant's promises of easy power. You also hear that the cultists have set up camp near the Swiftrun River, southeast of the Convictory. Unfortunately, it seems that Zhai'a Nelhah has heard this, too, and has headed off to confront them without you. Find him before he gets himself killed."
6,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_06","You find Zhai'a Nelhah in time to assist him in fending off an attack by the Defiant. He apologizes for his hypocrisy in attempting to engage the cultists alone. However, he goes on to explain that he feared the Defiant mages would lose control of their powers if forced to defend themselves against a black mage of your skill. With, once again, no Defiant survivors to question, you are left with no leads. Return to Lalai and pass on Zhai'a Nelhah's apologies."
7,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_07","Though you were unable to apprehend Waldeve, Lalai sees this latest development as encouraging. The fact that the Defiant were forced to travel all the way to the frozen wastelands of western Coerthas would seem to confirm that they are growing increasingly desperate. If things continue in this vein, it will not be much longer before these renegade black mages are brought to justice. And when they are, the dangerous tome of dark magicks they have stolen─the Book of Thal─can be safely secured.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 60."

51,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_010","Thank you for coming so quickly. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I have something to ask of you."
52,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_011","Some time ago, the Conjurers' Guild contacted the various cities of the realm, entreating assistance in the search for─and capture of─Waldeve. It seems that this finally paid off. They just received a missive from the Temple Knights of Ishgard. The Defiant have been sighted at the Holy See!"
53,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_012","The cult has been trying to garner popular support there. They've been offering what they claim is “the power to defeat the Dravanians” to anyone who will listen."
54,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_020","I hear that you have made something of a name for yourself among the High Houses of Ishgard. I, however, know next to nothing about their lands."
55,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_030","Now that Ishgard has opened its borders, it is no longer difficult to travel to the Holy See. However, I still know next to nothing about their lands."
56,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_040","Please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, would you lend me your assistance in tracking down this evil cult and bringing them to justice?"
57,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_LALAI_000_041","Zhai'a, you have made no effort to conceal your disapproval of we black mages and our ways. Are we to understand that you have now come to accept us?"
58,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_043","...That I have.
The Temple Knights who provided us with this intelligence are stationed at the Arc of the Worthy, within the city of Ishgard. They will be waiting for us there."
59,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_LALAI_000_044","Much though I would like to believe that he has had a change of heart, men are not wont to change so simply. One does not live one's whole life hating black magic, only to change one's mind over the exoneration of a single mage."

64,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_TEMPLEKNIGHT01682_000_051","They were ranting on and on to anyone who would listen, offering the power to defeat the Dravanians. We Ishgardians have our own way of fighting─we told them as much quite plainly. But it made no difference; they continued their proselytizing."
65,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_TEMPLEKNIGHT01682_000_052","Obviously such blasphemy could not be allowed to stand. We Temple Knights made our move, but they managed to get away. It hardly mattered to us at the time─they were no longer spreading their lies here─but they recently reappeared, this time at the Convictory in the western highlands."
66,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_TEMPLEKNIGHT01682_000_053","Most Convictors would do anything to earn honor and glory through the slaying of a powerful dragon. They are young and full of spirit...and naive. I fear that some among them may be deceived, seduced by promises of easy power."
67,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_054","Hmph. Gullible fools... Well, our destination is clear. To the Convictory!"
68,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_TEMPLEKNIGHT01682_000_055","The cultists you seek have been sighted at the Convictory, in the Coerthas western highlands."

82,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_107","Had we fought together, things would have turned out differently. You, taking down the mages in a flash of black magic; me, nullifying their every attack with my healing spells..."
83,"TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_ZHAIANELHAH_000_108","I truly was a fool to assume all black magic was evil. I should have seen that such power can be harnessed safely─just as it is by you."
