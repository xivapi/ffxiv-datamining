Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a similarly steady-handed Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of frangible components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA502_01510_SEQ_01","Duzal Meyean has asked you to synthesize components for the many oil lamps which will light the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. Proper equipment to craft the lighting, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA502_01510_SEQ_02","Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild is building an orphanage and is in short supply of lumber. Travel west to the Tangle and gather fifteen mangrove branches and five mangrove logs."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA502_01510_SEQ_03","You have gathered a sufficient amount of mangrove wood. Return it to Fyrbryda before another orphan passes away of exposure. Also, do not forget to submit the lamp component materials to the forgewife for inspection."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA502_01510_SEQ_04","Fyrbryda has granted you access to the Diamond Forge's crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by Duzal Meyean and inspected by Fyrbryda to synthesize two high-quality lamp components. Once completed, return to Ehcatl with the items.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Fyrbryda."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA502_01510_SEQ_05","You have delivered the lamp components to Duzal Meyean. The veteran believes the light that floods forth from this brilliant beacon will guide the Ehcatl Nine to the legendary home of their ancestors, Ayatlan."
