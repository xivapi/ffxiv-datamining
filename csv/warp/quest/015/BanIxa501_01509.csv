Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a skilled Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of intricate components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA501_01509_SEQ_01","Duzal Meyean has asked you to synthesize components for the system of speaking tubes to be installed on the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA501_01509_SEQ_02","Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild is in short supply of tangle skippers─a rare variety of air-breathing fish from which medicine for the pox is brewed. Travel west to the Tangle and catch two skippers using moth pupae."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA501_01509_SEQ_03","You have caught two tangle skippers. Return them to Fyrbryda before the heat sees them grow ripe. Also, do not forget to submit the speaking tube component materials to the forgewife for inspection."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA501_01509_SEQ_04","Fyrbryda has granted you access to the Diamond Forge's crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by Duzal Meyean and inspected by Fyrbryda to synthesize a high-quality speaking tube component. Once completed, return to Ehcatl with the item.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Fyrbryda."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA501_01509_SEQ_05","You have delivered the speaking tube component to Duzal Meyean. The veteran is taken aback by the obvious effort put into crafting the complex piece and expresses his desire to work with you once again in the future."
