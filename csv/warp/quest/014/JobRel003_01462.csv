Recognizing the benefits of collaboration, the excitable young arcanist bids you procure three bottles of superior enchanted ink. The ink can be had from none other than your favorite merchant, Rowena, at Revenant's Toll."
4,"TEXT_JOBREL003_01462_SEQ_04","Rowena has plenty of superior enchanted ink in stock, and offers to sell you bottles of it in exchange for Allagan tomestones. Acquire three such bottles, and present them to Hubairtin at the Bonfire."
