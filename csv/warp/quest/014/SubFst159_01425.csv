1,"TEXT_SUBFST159_01425_SEQ_01","Eral has espied a lovely maid frolicking in the Acorn Orchard, and would have you discover whether a feast is nigh. Head off toward the play area outside the Carpenters' Guild to see what so pleases the fair Yedythe."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST159_01425_SEQ_02","Yedythe proves to be a dancing master, albeit a rather agitated one at the moment. The younglings under her instruction have fled for more congenial pursuits. Yedythe wonders if Timbermaster Beatin may be of assistance in tracking them down."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST159_01425_SEQ_03","Beatin's solution is deceptively simple: a toy for each child. Using the skills that won you acclaim as a tracker, find the truant younglings and present them with the toys."
4,"TEXT_SUBFST159_01425_SEQ_04","The younglings see the toys through the lens of their hopes, and return to the orchard resolved to give their nervous dance instructor another try. Return to Yedythe and tell her of what transpired."
5,"TEXT_SUBFST159_01425_SEQ_05","Yedythe is delighted to realize that she and the younglings have formed a tentative bond. She teaches you the harvest dance, and is impressed at your talent for it. However, before her plaudits can continue, Beatin appears and inadvertently scares off the poor instructor."
