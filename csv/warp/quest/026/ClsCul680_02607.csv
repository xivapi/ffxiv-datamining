1,"TEXT_CLSCUL680_02607_SEQ_01","Having practiced until he could make udon to his satisfaction, Raulf now has his sights set on something called <Emphasis>sushi</Emphasis>, which he describes as little mounds of rice topped with raw fish. Though it may sound simple, it is said to be an indulgence of the highest order and is nigh impossible to make without training under a proper master in Hingashi. As he is unable to abandon his job at the restaurant, Raulf begs you make the long journey in his stead to learn the basics of sushi-making. Set forth for the Hingan port of Kugane, and upon arrival seek out an inn called the Bokairo, where one of the realm's foremost sushi chefs is to be found."
2,"TEXT_CLSCUL680_02607_SEQ_02","At the Bokairo, Karaku informs you that their sushi chef, Shamoji, is currently out in the Ruby Sea gathering ingredients. As there is no telling when he might return, Karaku suggests you look for him in the waters near the Isle of Bekko."
3,"TEXT_CLSCUL680_02607_SEQ_03","Taking your search under the sea, you manage to locate Chef Shamoji. Alas, the haughty Kojin refuses to consider you for his apprentice, and warns you not to bother him again. Having come so far, however, it would not do to give up so easily. Follow Shamoji back to the Bokairo and try to convince him to give you a chance."
4,"TEXT_CLSCUL680_02607_SEQ_04","Your second attempt to speak with Shamoji gets off to a poor start, but by incredible luck, Dellemont chances to be at the Bokairo at the exact same moment. With his unreserved endorsement of your skills, Shamoji cannot help but agree to take you on as his apprentice. The lessons begin immediately, and before long you succeed in grasping the basics of sushi-making to a very impressed Shamoji. Hurry now back to Revenant's Toll and share your knowledge with Raulf."
5,"TEXT_CLSCUL680_02607_SEQ_05","Back at the Revenant's Toll, you share all you have learned of sushi-making with an eager Raulf. Wasting no time, he begins to prepare the dish for the local Domans, Anzu and her father included, and asks you to contribute one plate to the catering effort. Make the nigiri-zushi with the ingredients given to you and present it to Raulf.

Though it comes with a caveat, he offers praise for your handiwork. And while Raulf's falls well short of impressing, his earnest effort is acknowledged, and he dares to hope that Unzan finally approves of him and Anzu. Alas, his hopes are swiftly crushed, for Unzan reveals his true reason for rejecting Raulf: his Ala Mhigan blood. Theirs is the proud blood of Yanxia, Unzan explains, and only a man of equally pure lineage is fit for his daughter. Dejected, Raulf decides to return to being an adventurer and walks off as Anzu looks on in dismay. With both her father and fiancée having left, it falls to you to reach out to her in this difficult moment."
8,"TEXT_CLSCUL680_02607_SEQ_08","Initially struck speechless in disbelief, Anzu chooses to believe in Raulf, saying that he must have reasons for his decision. She implores you to continue lending him your aid and directs you to the kitchen, where he is likely to be."
9,"TEXT_CLSCUL680_02607_SEQ_09","Though you find Raulf garbed in his adventuring attire, he declares that he hasn't given up on Anzu. Her father's statement that Far Eastern cuisine owes its greatness to its purity tugs at his mind, and he needs some time to ponder it. The odds are admittedly long, but Raulf believes that there is a chance he can make Unzan reconsider his stance. Whatever your friend may be planning, remain on hand that you might assist him should the need arise.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Raulf upon reaching level 70."
