1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ804_01934_SEQ_01","Feltsmox is still having no success in her fishing endeavors. The wildebeest eyes you procured for her are great bait and should be attracting fish from malms around, but she hasn't had a single bite. It seems that the fish that normally inhabit the river are being scared away by the damselflies that roam its edge. Slay five of these beasts so that the fish think it is safe enough to return."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ804_01934_SEQ_02","Having slain a number of damselflies, the constant buzzing of their wings no longer fills the air. Hopefully this quiet and blissful serenity attracts fish looking to escape the bustle and noise of wherever they are now. Return to Feltsmox and let her know that she is no longer fishing in empty waters."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ804_01934_SEQ_03","Though she appreciates your efforts, even with the damselflies having been dealt with, Feltsmox is still unable to catch any fish. Not to be outdone, she resolves to rethink her fishing strategy altogether."

Feltsmox still catches no fish! Bait has no problem... Fish must be frightened by something."
