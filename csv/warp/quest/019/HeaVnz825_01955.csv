1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_01","Notched Bone has once again seen the same suspicious goblin as before and is still convinced that this goblin is up to no good. He asks you to once again help him follow this goblin, with the aim of catching him in the middle of some heinous act. It seems this Roegadyn won't be convinced of the goblin's innocence until he witnesses it with his own eyes. Meet him in the Answering Quarter and help him see for himself the goblin's true nature."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_02","Notched Bone tells you that the suspicious goblin he saw is traveling down the road southward. Catch up with the Roegadyn further down the road as he stalks his suspect."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_03","Notched Bone tells you that one of the more suspicious items he saw the goblin packing during his preparations back at Idyllshire was a length of rope. He seems quite worried that this goblin may be planning a kidnapping of some sort. Follow Notched Bone further along the road and speak with him again."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_04","The goblin you are following appears to be looking for someone. Seeing the goblin searching for someone in so secluded an area has Notched Bone increasingly convinced that this goblin is up to no good. He still seems to be traveling down the road. Meet with Notched Bone again near the intersection."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_05","You happen upon a number of monsters─slain, apparently, without difficulty. Dedean is worried about the risks of confronting someone capable of dispatching so many beasts with such ease. Notched Bone, however, steels his resolve, concerned for the well-being of the citizens of Idyllshire. The goblin must be headed towards the ruined bridge. Go there and speak again with Notched Bone."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_06","You find the goblin and another man, Edred, and soon get to the bottom of Notched Bone's misunderstanding. In exchange for massages from the goblin, Edred has been slaying Orn kites for their meat. The goblin ties these downed birds into braces with a rope, before performing the effective─but excruciatingly painful─traditional goblin massage techniques on him. Inspired by their cooperation and ashamed of doubting the innocent goblin, Notched Bone affirms his desire to be a citizen of Idyllshire. Confused but ever generous, the goblin eagerly welcomes him with an excruciatingly painful goblin massage."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_07","It is unclear if Notched Bone is in a state of relaxation following the goblin's massage, or in shock from the pain of it. Whichever the case, he is taking some time to rest beneath the bridge. He intends to return to Idyllshire shortly and asks you to meet with him there."
8,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_SEQ_08","Having finally come to realize how mistaken they have been, Notched Bone and Dedean resolve to become active members of the Idyllshire society. They plan to work hard and repay their debt to the goblins for all the kindness the goblins offered but which they rudely refused. They thank you, especially, for helping them come to this realization about the true nature of the goblins and their generosity."

54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ825_01955_DEDEAN_000_022","Notched Bone's right. This goblin's definitely up to no good. We might've been fooled by that moneylender back in Ul'dah, but we won't get fooled this time!"

He should be near this place... Where has he gone?"
