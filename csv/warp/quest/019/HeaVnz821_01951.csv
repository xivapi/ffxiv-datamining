1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ821_01951_SEQ_01","Notched Bone is still convinced that the goblins have brainwashed the citizens of Idyllshire, and you are unable to convince him otherwise. He hopes to cure the citizens of this brainwashing by exposing what he thinks is a grand, nefarious scheme by the goblins. He saw a goblin armed and heading out towards the Collectors' Quarter and he is sure she was up to no good. Perhaps if you find out what this goblin is <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> up to, you can convince Notched Bone that they can be trusted."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ821_01951_SEQ_02","You speak with the goblin and learn that she is exterminating the damselflies in the area. Apparently there are egg-bearing damselflies nearby which must be eliminated before they can lay their eggs. If they do, the young that hatch will quickly get out of hand. Help the goblin by slaying three of the damselflies."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ821_01951_SEQ_03","With the damselflies slain, the risk of them breeding out of control has been negated. Let the goblin know that there is no more work to be done here."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ821_01951_SEQ_04","The goblin happily thanks you for helping her finish her work so quickly. The area should now be much safer for the inhabitants of Idyllshire. Return to Notched Bone with this proof that the goblins are kind-hearted and trying only to help."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ821_01951_SEQ_05","You explain to Notched Bone that the goblin he saw was simply keeping the surrounds of Idyllshire clear of dangerous monsters, but he remains unconvinced. He somehow still thinks that the goblins are up to no good─despite all evidence to the contrary."
