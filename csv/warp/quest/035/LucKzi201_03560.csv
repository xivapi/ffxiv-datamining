Ronitt looks pleased to see you."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_01","Ronitt once more expresses his gratitude to you for helping him improve his less-than-impressive dwarven manners. Now, however, the ambitious blacksmith wishes to locate a fine drop of grog to properly fuel his inventive urges. Your mention of Wright ale piques his interest, and he bids you to accompany him to speak to the village's mayor.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_02","Ronitt's request for Wright's finest ale is met with disappointment as Sai-Lewq and Eueliss explain the poor condition of their fields. The dwarf claims, however, that he may be able to help, and you find yourself being dragged back to the village of Tomra."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_03","It seems that one of Xemutt's old stories holds a hint for solving the problem of Wright's underfed soil─a mineral known as rock phosphate. Xemutt directs Ronitt towards the former trading town of Amity, where a sample of rock phosphate might still be found."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_04","Your arrival in Amity causes a small stir, but Ronitt's fine manners help secure you a warm welcome. Before long, a resident has given you leave to search the old trading crates for a chunk of rock phosphate."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_05","You prise open a weathered wooden box to reveal the yellow-hued object of your search. Deliver the mineral sample to Ronitt."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_06","An excited Ronitt accepts the chunk of rock phosphate and explains his plans to construct a mineral-sensing automaton. While he is occupied with building his invention, he asks that you visit the mayor of Wright to arrange a rendezvous."
7,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_07","You pass on Ronitt's plans to Sai-Lewq and Eueliss. Though somewhat dubious, the pair agree to accompany you to Tomra and the scheduled meeting place."
8,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_SEQ_08","You arrive with your guests from Wright just in time for Ronitt to provide a demonstration of his automaton's phosphate-finding capabilities. Much to the surprise of Sai-Lewq and Eueliss, the “Orehound Ogre” soon returns with a barrow full of the yellow rock. The trundling contraption─and the ensuing commotion─attracts the attention of Chief Xamott, who heaps praise upon his diligent Tholl kin. Sai-Lewq then proceeds to strike a deal with the eldermost elder: ownership of the rock phosphate in return for a future delivery of the finest Wright ale. It seems you and Ronitt have helped forge a new bond between the villages of Wright and Tomra, and both parties agree that your timely involvement has changed their fates for the better."

54,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_RONITT_000_011","It ain't that Tomra's brews are bad, but if I could get my hands on an extra-fine fermented beverage, then I reckon my work would really take off!"

56,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_RONITT_000_013","Wright ale...? And this drink once put their village on the map, eh? Well, then, I'd best take a trip down the cliff and have a chat with their leader!"

87,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_XEMUTT_000_055","Aye. Crushed into small bits, you can spread it over a field to enrich the soil. But the old seam was mined out years ago, and I've not heard if we've come across another..."
88,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_RONITT_000_056","That sounds perfect...you know, aside from there not bein' any left. No one kept a stockpile, then?"
89,"TEXT_LUCKZI201_03560_XEMUTT_000_057","Well, they might still have a chunk or two over in Amity. That was where the old trading house used to stand─neutral ground and all."
