1,"TEXT_JOBRDM601_02583_SEQ_01","X'rhun appears eager to continue your training now that his vendetta against Lambard has come to a close. Travel to the Dravanian hinterlands, and meet your mentor near the aetheryte in Idyllshire."
2,"TEXT_JOBRDM601_02583_SEQ_02","X'rhun proposes that you hone your skills on the Illuminati aggressors threatening the people of Idyllshire. Head towards the Arkhitekton, and survey the area for worthy opponents."

4,"TEXT_JOBRDM601_02583_SEQ_04","After praising your victory over the goblins, X'rhun begins to express concern over Arya's continued absence. Make your way back to the Arkhitekton, and search for your fellow student of red magic."
5,"TEXT_JOBRDM601_02583_SEQ_05","You come across an exhausted Arya in the aftermath of a hard-won battle. When you attempt to rouse her, however, she grows suddenly hostile, and you are forced to render her unconscious. Return to Idyllshire, and check on her recovery at Rowena's Center for Cultural Promotion."
6,"TEXT_JOBRDM601_02583_SEQ_06","Arya appears to remember next to nothing of her actions following her battle with the Illuminati forces. Speak with X'rhun, and hear his thoughts on Arya's uncharacteristic actions."
7,"TEXT_JOBRDM601_02583_SEQ_07","X'rhun shares his observations of Arya's sudden transformation, likening it to the change which came over Lambard before he commenced feeding on living aether. Determined to discover a cure to this dreadful condition, the Crimson Duelist bids you make ready for another expedition.

※The next red mage quest will be available from X'rhun upon reaching level 63."
