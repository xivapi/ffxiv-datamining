1,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_SEQ_01","Nonowato informs you that he has at last finished compiling his long list of minerals. He proceeds to tease you with the exciting prospect of actual work, before noting that Stickqix wishes to brief you himself first. To that end, Nonowato leads you in the direction of the Bangpots."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_SEQ_02","Regrettably, Stickqix's hands are full with other matters and he is unable to give you anything approaching an adequate briefing. You discover that his two Roegadyn workers are in the midst of a spat, bringing work on the Gobroller to a total standstill. Stickqix sheepishly asks if you would not mind intervening on his behalf to help solve the dispute. "
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_SEQ_03","You patiently listen to each worker's gripes and soon discover the cause of the dispute. Krystrymm is of the opinion that the vehicle needs to be outfitted with sturdy armor built to withstand physical attacks. Fohcwyda, on the other hand, believes that magic is the greatest threat to the Gobroller and would see it fitted with the appropriate protection. You go over what you have heard and ready yourself to give a summary to Stickqix."
4,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_SEQ_04","You explain to Stickqix just why his workers are butting heads. He remarks that he may have an idea as to how this dispute can be resolved, but says it will require a certain mineral. The chief asks you to mine twenty chunks of beggar's mythril ore from the Striped Hills in Gyr Abania."
5,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_SEQ_05","Stickqix uses the minerals you procured on his behalf to create an ingot, which he shows to Krystrymm and Fohcwyda. The two of them are tasked with using this metal to create armor resistant to both magical and physical attacks. The fight finished, you choose to join Nonowato outside to discuss future work."
6,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_SEQ_06","Nonowato unreservedly apologizes for the actions of his colleagues and encourages you to rest up well before your help is required again. You decide to follow his advice while continuing to hone your mining skills on the side.

※The next miner quest will be available from Nonowato upon reaching level 65."

63,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_KRYSTRYMM_000_020","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. What's that? You've heard that Fohcwyda and I haven't been on the best of terms lately? Well, I suppose that's one way of putting it."

65,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_KRYSTRYMM_000_022","Ask anyone in Idyllshire and they'd tell you the machine needs heavy armor capable of withstanding physical attacks. Anyone except Fohcwyda anyway.

66,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_KRYSTRYMM_000_023","Absolutely no clue how the chief expects me to work with someone who, never mind the forest, can't even see the trees surrounded by monsters in the hinterlands!"
67,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_FOHCWYDA_000_030","If you are here about a certain quarrel then you may as well just leave now. I would not expect a miner to understand the complexities of armor design."
68,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_FOHCWYDA_000_031","That being said, it is hardly a complicated matter. My point is simple: we need to equip the Gobroller with ample protection against magic. That loggerhead simply needs to acquiesce and we can resume our work once more."
69,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_FOHCWYDA_000_032","As I am sure you have noted during your adventures, these lands have their fair share of fantastic beasts that wield deadly magic.

88,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_KRYSTRYMM_000_085","Chief, how could you!? You may as well tie the Gobroller up in a neat little bow and gift it to the beasts at this rate!"
89,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_STICKQIX_000_086","Pshhh... Shkohhh... Now, now, let's not jump to any rash conclusions here, you two. Imagine this: we make sheet metal using this ingot, proceeding to wrap it in the regular sheet metal we use for vehicle armor."
90,"TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_KRYSTRYMM_000_087","That's all very well and good as an idea, but in practice, that's going to weigh the vehicle down to no end!"
