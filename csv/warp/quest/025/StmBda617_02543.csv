79,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_STARKWOAD_000_047","(-Stark Woad-)Aye. I overheard soldiers talking while working in the mess. The ceruleum pipeline fueling the cannon was destroyed by an unidentified male insurgent, they said."
80,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_ALPHINAUD_000_048","One man single-handedly disabled the cannon? That beggars belief!"
81,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_STARKWOAD_000_049","(-Stark Woad-)Nevertheless, that's what they said. It took a while, but they've finally put the fires out, and the engineers have been working day and night to repair it."
82,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_STARKWOAD_000_050","(-Stark Woad-)Wish I could tell you more, but the incident had everyone jumping at shadows and afraid to say much more. To make matters worse, the Ala Mhigan help have been sent home indefinitely."
83,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_ALISAIE_000_051","So the cannon could already be fully operational..."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_LYSE_000_052","We need to sneak inside Castrum Abania to ensure the cannon is no longer a threat to our troops. Can you help us?"
85,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_STARKWOAD_000_053","(-Stark Woad-)Aye, that much I can do. I've pieced together a map of the interior over the years, and I know for a fact that there are multiple points of entry."
86,"TEXT_STMBDA617_02543_ALPHINAUD_000_054","Impressive...
If we split into several groups, that may improve our odds of reaching the fire control center."
