65,"TEXT_STMBDA605_02531_ALPHINAUD_000_045","Hm. 'Twas the Qalyana broodmother's desire to bring about her daughter's resurrection which first called forth Sri Lakshmi from the aether. That being the case, I rather doubt the goddess will be spoiling for a fight."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA605_02531_ALISAIE_000_046","That would depend. The primal's motives will have been colored by the summoner's state of mind─namely, that of a grieving mother who had just borne witness to her daughter's murder. Though she apparently craved a miracle, she may also have harbored thoughts of vengeance.
Moreover, the Qalyana's conception of Sri Lakshmi may differ from that of the Vira."
67,"TEXT_STMBDA605_02531_SARISHA_000_047","Thisss is true. The Vira and the Qalyana do indeed regard the Lady of Blisss in different ways."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA605_02531_SARISHA_000_048","To the Vira, Sri Lakshmi embodies freedom. She would not sssuffer Her daughters to be bound to another's will. And ssso we ssstand with the Resissstance againssst the Empire, and give our lives for the cause."
69,"TEXT_STMBDA605_02531_SARISHA_000_049","To the Qalyana, however, She embodies transsscendental beauty, which they ssstrive to create through their craft. To shape cryssstal is lesss art and more ritual─a sssacred duty wherein each tribute is imbued with a fragment of the sssoul."
