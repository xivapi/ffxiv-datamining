49,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_STARKWOAD_000_005","I can imagine how you must feel, but I want you to know that many of us here are grateful for what you did at Abania."
50,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_MNAAGO_000_010","I'll never get used to it, killing my own countrymen. In the heat of battle, it's either you or them, but after...when you've had time to think about what you've done..."
51,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_SERPENTOFFICER_100_010","I am told one of your comrades was injured during the operation. If there is aught we can do to help, pray do not hesitate to ask."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_020","I've been thinking. If Alisaie needs more time to heal, maybe we should move her to Rhalgr's Reach."
53,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_021","She can receive much better care there, after all. Our infirmary is probably the best place for her, short of sending her to Gridania."
54,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALPHINAUD_000_022","Indeed. And given what Mistress Woad has told us, I would rather she did not remain here."
55,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_023","Then it's settled. Naago, go and see about getting us a carriage and an escort. Alphinaud, you should get your sister ready for the journey."
56,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_024","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, would you mind going on ahead and telling Orella that we're on our way? I want a bed waiting for Alisaie when she arrives. Thanks."
57,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_STARKWOAD_000_025","They'll learn what it means to live free. We'll teach them. Together."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_030","Must seem strange seeing me doling out orders. But not half as strange as it feels to do it, let me tell you."
59,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ORELLA_000_040","Hm? Do you require assistance?"
60,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ORELLA_000_041","Very well, we will make ready to receive the patient at once. Give me a hand, would you?"
61,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ORELLA_000_042","There. All crisp and freshly laundered."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALPHINAUD_000_043","We're here. Is everything in order?"
63,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALPHINAUD_000_044","Right. We're bringing her in."
64,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALISAIE_000_045","Honestly, Alphinaud, you needn't have gone to all this trouble..."
65,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALPHINAUD_000_046","What can I say? It seemed a good way to discourage you from limping off to battle when my back was turned. Listen to Orella, please. You need your rest."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALISAIE_000_047","I know, I know...
Any news of Krile? She'll be cross if you make her wait too long. As will I."
67,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALPHINAUD_000_048","Hah. A chilling prospect indeed... I'll find her, Sister. And I'll fight twice as hard─for the both of us."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_049","They're good together...when they're not at each other's throats. I miss that feeling..."
69,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_050","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─I have a favor to ask. Would you mind waiting outside for me? I won't be a moment."
70,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALPHINAUD_000_055","We'll find Krile and bring her home. After all, I need her to tell you to stay in bed."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALISAIE_000_060","I should have been there with you to the end. If only I hadn't been so reckless..."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_080","<pant> <pant> Maybe we got a little carried away... But you have to admit that was fun."
73,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_081","Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You're the best kind of friend─the kind that's not afraid to knock some sense into you."
