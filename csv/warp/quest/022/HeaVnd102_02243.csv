0,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_00","Alphinaud is eager to hear what tidings Ser Aymeric has to share."
1,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_01","It would seem that Ser Aymeric has a favor to ask. Now that Nidhogg is possessed of both of his eyes, the lord commander believes that there is only one being capable of standing against the vengeful shade─Nidhogg's own brood-brother, Hraesvelgr. As such, he would have you escort him to Zenith, and aid him in convincing the great wyrm to stand with Ishgard. Though Alphinaud harbors understandable doubts as to the wisdom of this course, it is plain that Ser Aymeric will not be swayed. Notify the lord commander when you are ready to depart."
2,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_02","Though Ser Aymeric is ready to ascend Sohm Al, he acquiesces to Alphinaud's suggestion that you first visit Vidofnir at Anyx Trine. Travel to the Dravanian forelands, and speak with the wounded dragon."
3,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_03","Vidofnir dismisses your concern regarding her injury, but can offer little in the way of hope for your intended audience with her sire. Disheartened but not dissuaded, Ser Aymeric resolves to press on into the Churning Mists."

51,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_ALPHINAUD_000_005","I somehow doubt that Hraesvelgr will be pleased to see us. But for Estinien's sake, and that of countless others, I suppose we must risk his displeasure."

57,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_ALPHINAUD_000_044","Shall we be about our task, then? We have no way of knowing when Nidhogg's shade will strike, but we must assume that time is not our ally."
58,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_AYMERIC_000_045","Indeed. With that in mind, I have taken the liberty of dispatching a messenger to inform Mistress Tataru that you will be escorting me to Sohm Al. I confess, I did not provide the exact details of our destination, as they are as yet unknown to me..."
59,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_ALPHINAUD_000_046","We will summon Hraesvelgr at Zenith in the Churning Mists. Ere we begin our ascent, however, I think it best that we pay a visit to Anyx Trine."

62,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_ALPHINAUD_000_049","I propose this in part out of concern for her condition. Were she to succumb to her wounds, it could have grave consequences for our alliance. That apart, she may be able to provide insight into her sire's current state of mind."

64,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_TATARU_000_055","A nice young knight told me you were off to negotiate with Hraesvelgr again. Have you considered using the Manderville art of parley? It's surprisingly effective, you know!"

68,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_AYMERIC_000_063","Full glad am I to hear it. You were the guest of honor at our conference, and we failed in our duty of protection. On behalf of Ishgard, I apologize unreservedly."
69,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_VIDOFNIR_000_064","...I am a dragon full-grown, and thou thought to protect <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>, mortal? I was tempered by the fires of battle ere thy great-grandsire learned to crawl."
70,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_VIDOFNIR_000_065","Thy words do remind me of a knight whom I called friend some thousand years past. He swore to defend me from harm and hardship..."

But if it is folly to hope, I am content to die a fool."
