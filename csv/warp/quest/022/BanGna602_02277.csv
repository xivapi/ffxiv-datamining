※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA602_02277_SEQ_01","All of the Vath keeneye's attempts to deliver a package addressed to a dragon by the name of Uhm Ala have ended in dismal failure. Aside from the name stenciled neatly on the parcel, the only tidbit of information he has to go on is that Uhm Ala has yellow scales. Unfortunately, many dragons residing in the towers fit this description. He thinks that maybe an experienced adventurer like you will have better luck delivering the package, and asks that you take over this assignment for him.

56,"TEXT_BANGNA602_02277_DRAGONA02277_000_015","Saying I look like Uhm Ala is akin to comparing one of your kings to a peasant. Hmph. Do all of your people so disrespect your betters?"
