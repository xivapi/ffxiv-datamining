50,"TEXT_LUCKZC007_03390_LETHENMAER_000_002","We can't be sure whether it was stolen from the Imperative or if they got it from one of our own, selling it from under our noses. Whatever the cause, we need to get to the bottom of this."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZC007_03390_LETHENMAER_000_003","I want you to locate the stolen weapons and bring one back to me as evidence. My men'll collect the rest later. And if those thieving bastards try anything, do whatever is necessary to defend yourself."

58,"TEXT_LUCKZC007_03390_LETHENMAER_000_042","The markings on the hilt indicate the unit it belonged to. In this case, the rightful owner was part of a patrol that was attacked by sin eaters some time ago. Though we were able to recover their bodies, their weapons had already been taken."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZC007_03390_LETHENMAER_000_043","Gear like this would fetch a high price, but the fact that the looters kept it for themselves worries me. Whatever they were planning, it seems you were able to put a stop to it."
