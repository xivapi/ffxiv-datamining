56,"TEXT_LUCKMB117_03318_SETO_000_032","I simply cannot bear to see men fight and die. Not anymore. None of us can. To lose one who has placed a gentle hand on us even once fills our hearts with untold sorrow, as my brothers and sisters will readily attest."

83,"TEXT_LUCKMB117_03318_SETO_000_100","By the ease with which you slew those sin eaters, I see that you are capable."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMB117_03318_SETO_000_101","However, I still require time to think. And if you should be willing, there is a favor I would ask of you."
