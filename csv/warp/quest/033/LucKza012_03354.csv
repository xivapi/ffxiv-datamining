55,"TEXT_LUCKZA012_03354_PHARMACIST03354_000_013","You're welcome to collect a few strips in her stead if you like... Although I don't expect you'd want the bother."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA012_03354_PHARMACIST03354_000_014","...Still here? Very well, then. Find some trees, and use this knife to very carefully peel away three pieces of nice, dry bark. I won't hold my breath."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA012_03354_PHARMACIST03354_000_015","All I need is three or so nicely dried strips of bark. Make sure you use that copper knife. Very important. Oh, and do bring the knife back, if you please?"

I suppose I have no choice now but to mix up the cure I promised. "
