51,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_002","Ahem. In short, I need you to meet me at the Northern Staging Point. Please."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_010","We'll be assessing the situation out here. Though it may save time if you were to first tell me what destruction you personally witnessed?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_011","Many structures burned or otherwise damaged in the fighting... Yes, I thought as much. I may look into procuring tents so that the laborers come to assist in the reconstruction need not journey back and forth each day─that ought to save time."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_012","I'd be curious to know whether anything out here actually has survived. Might I ask you to survey the northern area and tell me if you find any materiel or other supplies that might still be fit for use?"

59,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_030","Finished your inspection, have you? What did you find?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_031","Oh, shepherds around here use this sort of cane. It must belong to one of the residents. Or former residents, now, I suppose..."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_032","We can return it to them, though I imagine they'd rather have their land and livestock back. What else was there?"
62,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_033","Good to hear that I shouldn't need to procure any fresh tents. The weapons are less immediately useful, though I will of course have them collected. It seems that I'll primarily need to order tools, as there were none to be found in the areas I checked, either."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_034","I very much appreciate your help─this has gone much more swiftly for your presence. Would you accept a small reward? I have a bit of coin stored for just such an occasion back at the fort."
