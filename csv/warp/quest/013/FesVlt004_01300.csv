※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_01","Summoning the divine powers of her ancestors, Lady Lisette has ascertained that a pirate lass only a stone's throw from the festival square in Limsa Lominsa has an uneasy heart on this Valentione's Day. Speak with O'kalkaya and see what troubles her.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_02","O'kalkaya of the Sanguine Sirens is concerned for Captain Rhoswen, who she suspects is preparing in secret for a fateful confrontation with the Kraken's Arms, the Sirens' longtime archrivals. Speak with Guildmaster Lyngsath at the Bismarck, which Rhoswen has been frequenting often in recent days."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_03","Lyngsath is reluctant to share Rhoswen's secrets, offering only a cryptic comment that whatever the two are preparing, it is sure to cause sparks. Deliver this somewhat concerning news to O'kalkaya."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_04","Your report strikes fear into O'kalkaya, who is now convinced that her captain is preparing firesand for a showdown with the Krakens. No sooner does she voice this concern, however, than she realizes that a Kraken deckhand has overheard the entire conversation. She bids you go in pursuit of the man."
5,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_05","The Kraken deckhand smugly informs you that he has already relayed what he overheard to his captain, who would speak with you about the matter. Seek out Carvallain at the Seventh Sage."
6,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_06","It would appear that O'kalkaya's concerns were not unfounded, as Carvallain reveals that Rhoswen has challenged him to a duel. Suspecting that the Siren has some underhanded scheme up her sleeve, he insists that you serve as witness to ensure a fair fight. Travel to the designated location ahead of Carvallain to put a preemptive stop to any foul play."
7,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_07","You are not entirely sure whether you just witnessed a duel or a botched confession of love, but whatever it was, it is mercifully over, with only a single piece of Rhoswen's chocolate remaining in the aftermath. Return the captain's confection to her crewman O'kalkaya."
8,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_SEQ_08","O'kalkaya is taken aback upon realizing the true meaning behind the challenge. To defend her captain's honor, she insists that you speak not a word of what has transpired, offering a small gift to buy your silence. One can only hope that Rhoswen's wounds do not cut too deep."

55,"TEXT_FESVLT004_01300_OKALKAYA_000_004","What's more, she's been sneakin' about late at night, and to the Bismarck of all places. Call it sailor's intuition, but sure as the tide, I swear there's somethin' amiss... Could a showdown with those bloody Krakens be a-brewin'?"
