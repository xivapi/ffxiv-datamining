1,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_SEQ_01","Rammbroes explains that he had made arrangements for an acquaintance of his to obtain the remaining varieties of aethersand. Since doing so, however, the dig supervisor has received no word of any kind, prompting him to worry that something may be amiss. Seek Parsemontret in the Gridanian markets, and inquire as to where aethersand might be procured."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_SEQ_02","Parsemontret informs you that aethersand has not been sold in the markets for many years. Sensing your dejection, he mentions that you might consider mining the ore from which the water-aspected variety of the abrasive is refined. He is quick to point out, however, that the dangers inherent in this course of action make it an errand fit for desperate fools alone. Though you would ordinarily take issue with at least half of this description, it seems you have little choice but to accept the master's suggestion. Travel to Urth's Gift in the South Shroud and scour the territory of a particularly nasty hog."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_SEQ_03","While examining a large porcine carcass in Urth's Gift, you are addressed by an unseen observer who smugly declares that he has already collected the water-blessed ore that you came to find. Ostensibly on a whim, he then proposes a race to obtain a quantity of wind-aspected aethersand held by the Ixal. Hurry to the Ixali logging grounds in the North Shroud, and wrest the precious abrasive from the talons of the feathered beastmen."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_SEQ_04","After fighting your way past countless Ixal, you succeed in securing the wind-aspected aethersand. No sooner have you done so than you hear the voice of the unseen observer again. He thanks you for providing an entertaining spectacle, and declares his intention to reward your efforts. Travel to the clearing in Proud Creek and collect your prize, whatever it may be..."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_SEQ_05","Upon arriving at the clearing in Proud Creek, you are surprised to find the very thing you need most: water-aspected aethersand. With predictable timing, the unseen observer chooses this moment to break the silence, praising your deeds before promising that the two of you will soon meet again. Return to Saint Coinach's Find in Mor Dhona, and deliver the remaining abrasives to the waiting Rammbroes."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_SEQ_06","Back in Mor Dhona, Cid processes the flawless crystals of wind and water using the aethersand you procured, finally completing the set of “fangs” required to penetrate the Crystal Tower's defenses. Soon after, you are joined by Biggs, Wedge, and the owner of the voice which pursued you around the Twelveswood─one G'raha Tia. The expedition team thus assembled, it is time at last to find out what momentous discoveries await within the Allagans' glittering spire."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_RAMMBROES_000_002","To be frank, this lack of communication is not entirely uncharacteristic, but I cannot discount the possibility that something ill has befallen the man."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_RAMMBROES_000_003","Alas, we do not have time to investigate his fate. As I have mentioned before, the more we delay our expedition, the more likely it is that the Crystal Tower's secrets will fall into the wrong hands. Therefore, I would entrust you with the same mission I assigned to my friend. Travel to the Black Shroud, and seek out Parsemontret, the master of the markets in Gridania. If anyone knows where aethersand might be bought, it is he."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_PARSEMONTRET_000_010","Yes? ...I'm sorry? Did you say you wish to purchase <Emphasis>aethersand</Emphasis>? <If(PlayerParameter(4))>Forgive me, madam, but<Else/>My dear fellow,</If> have you the faintest idea of the rarity of the material you seek? Why, I have not seen so much as a grain of aethersand in these markets for many a long year."
53,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_PARSEMONTRET_000_011","I could tell you where one might mine the <Emphasis>ore</Emphasis> from which the water-aspected variety of the abrasive is derived, but only a desperate fool would willingly set foot in the place."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_PARSEMONTRET_000_012","...You seem undeterred.
<sigh> Very well."

79,"TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_069","Twice in the last decade, the promise of unimaginable power has prompted men to meddle with technology they do not understand, and the realm has been dragged unto the very brink of oblivion on both occasions.
