1,"TEXT_SUBCTS102_01216_SEQ_01","In hushed tones, Hugubert speaks of ill tidings from the mines of Copperbell. The fiendish hecatoncheires─believed to have been driven back to the umbral depths─have resurfaced, and many a roseate miner has paid the eternal price for returning to work too hastily. Your informant encourages you to speak to the Stone Torch posted outside the mines, located in western Thanalan, to see if aught can be done about the situation."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS102_01216_SEQ_02","The proud Stone Torch grudgingly admits that hecatoncheires have returned to plague the mines and, what is more, have proven far too formidable an opponent for his vaunted unit. Indeed, the entire mining operation is at risk if this new threat is not dealt with, and swiftly. It would seem that Copperbell dost want for an adventurer's succor once more.

50,"TEXT_SUBCTS102_01216_HUGUBERT_000_002","The Stone Torches would have us believe that they have matters under control, but a miner acquaintance of mine would beg to differ. He says the Torches have proven far more adept at quelling rumors than hecatoncheires, if you catch my drift."
