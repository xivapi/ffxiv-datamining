1,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SEQ_01","Sylphie laments the difficulty of teaching Gatty while Sanche's health is in decline, and asks that you lend her your talents. Make your way into Dimwold, and assess the situation."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SEQ_02","You arrive outside Gatty's home to find E–Sumi–Yan berating a sheepish Sylphie. Gatty and Sanche, however, are nowhere to be found. Fearing that the two have fled the guildmaster's approach only to invite further disaster, you rush off in pursuit. Travel north, and search the shallows of the Velodyna River."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SEQ_03","You locate Gatty and Sanche just in time to rescue them from another voidsent attack. E–Sumi–Yan arrives a short while after with Sylphie in tow, and suggests returning to the cabin to discuss what the future holds."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SEQ_04","After considering Gatty's unique situation, E–Sumi–Yan decides to permit you and Sylphie to continue the young Padjal's education at home. Head outside and discuss this development with Sylphie."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SEQ_05","Sylphie is delighted by the guildmaster's decision, and thanks you for the part you've played in allowing Gatty to remain with her mother. But there is still much work to be done before the girl learns complete control over her aether─show Gatty a good example, and continue to improve upon your own skills.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Sylphie upon reaching level 70."

59,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_ESUMIYAN_000_014","And now I find you concealing the presence of a Padjal─even from a distance, the nature of Gatty's aura was unmistakable. A Padjali child without guidance is an exceedingly dangerous thing, Sylphie. You know this."
60,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_ESUMIYAN_000_015","Her aether, wild and radiant, will grow even as she does...and so too shall the power of the fiends which gather to feed upon it. Should Gatty draw the attention of a greater voidsent, the entire region would suffer from its depredations."

I had almost forgotten that stubborn streak of yours. But I do recognize that responsibility for this situation falls not upon your shoulders alone: 'twas my failing as guildmaster to have overlooked the birth of a Padjal in the first place."

80,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_ESUMIYAN_000_041","From what Gatty and her mother have told me, the girl has received no formal guidance in how to contain her aether."
81,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_ESUMIYAN_000_042","Gatty's Padjali instincts allow her to suppress her aura when calm, but that will become increasingly difficult as her power grows with age. Eventually, even the briefest onslaught of emotion─a surge of anger, a whisper of fear─will be enough to shatter her control."
82,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SYLPHIE_000_043","And that's why I thought it best to teach Gatty here at home. Unlike other Padjal, she's lived her whole life with her mother."
83,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SYLPHIE_000_044","Taking her away from Sanche now would be disastrous. I know only too well the effect such a separation can have on a child..."

90,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_ESUMIYAN_000_048","Gatty's upbringing is an extremely rare case amongst the Padjal. It seems that it may, indeed, be the lesser risk to allow the girl to remain with her mother..."

92,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_ESUMIYAN_000_049","...However, if we are to avoid an escalation of these attacks, I must insist that Gatty learn the intricacies of her power under the official supervision of the Conjurers' Guild."
