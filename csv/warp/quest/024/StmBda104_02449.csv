57,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_ALPHINAUD_000_042","Thank you, Master Kemp. I believe we will do just that."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_ALPHINAUD_000_043","Let us make the most of this opportunity and assess the Resistance's capabilities."

69,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_073","Well, one of the smaller factions has. The rest won't have anything to do with us. We're no different from the Garleans to them."
70,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_074","They keep to themselves, spending all their time crafting. Ananta make the most amazing jewelry, by the way. They use magicks to twist metals and crystal into shapes you wouldn't believe. It's a pity people hardly ever get to see their work. But then most don't even know they exist."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_075","That's enough about them, anyway. Let's take a closer look at the statue of Rhalgr, shall we?"
72,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_080","When you've seen one aetheryte, you've seen them all, right? Not quite. This one's an older design, dating back decades, to when the Fist of Rhalgr was still here."
73,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_081","It may look a little different, but it works just as well as any other. I'll show you where the sutlers are next─but don't forget to attune to the aetheryte before we go!"
74,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_090","Pretty awe-inspiring, isn't it? The breaker of worlds, who guided our ancestors to these lands all those centuries ago."
75,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_100_090","Yda used to tell me the story on stormy nights. She wanted me to understand. To remember..."
76,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_091","""At the end of the Fifth Astral Era, when the waters rose higher and higher, people all across Eorzea beseeched the heavens for a sign. And lo, a burning star appeared in the eastern sky, and led the way to these mountains of Gyr Abania...“"
77,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_092","“They who were saved by His grace pledged to honor and revere Him. To devote themselves to great works without and within...”"
78,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_093","“A storm of blood approaches fast,
Hells open, Heavens weep.
For no one soul doth lie beyond
The measure of His Reach.”"
79,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_094","That last part was inscribed on this stone by a monk of the Fist of Rhalgr. Yda explained it to me: “A day will come bringing strife and sorrow that none may escape. Waste not these precious hours, but in quiet preparation make strong the body and mind.”"
80,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_095","I don't know if that “storm of blood” is finally upon us. But if it is, I have to believe that everything we've been through, everything that has led us to this point, will see us through in the end."
81,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_096","...Agh! Sorry. That was all a bit melodramatic, wasn't it? Let's keep moving, shall we? Off to the infirmary!"
82,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_100","This is the infirmary, as you can probably tell. Here's where the Resistance healers patch up the wounded and tend to the sick."
83,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_101","No matter how carefully we planned our operations, casualties were inevitable. It's a sad thing to think about, but...it's also important to remember the cost, as Conrad would say."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_102","We should go. I'll show you the aetheryte plaza next."
85,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_110","Arms, armor, potions─you name it, these folks've got it. The Resistance would be in a bad way without brave merchants to keep it provisioned."
