You engage the voidsent in battle without hesitation, whilst E–Sumi–Yan and Sylphie attempt to bolster Gatty's waning spirit. Gatty eventually regains control of her aether, and you succeed in casting the winged horror back into the void. Approach the grieving Padjal, and offer her what comfort you may."

Hoping to make her mother proud, she vows to study hard, and live a life of happiness as Sanche would have wanted. With Sylphie and E–Sumi–Yan there to guide her, you sense that Gatty has a wonderful future awaiting her at Stillglade Fane.
