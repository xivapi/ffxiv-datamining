1,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_SEQ_01","Alphinaud informs you that the Alliance council will shortly be convening again and urges you to make haste to the Lotus Stand. Announce yourself to the silent conjurer, then approach the Elder Seedseer."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_SEQ_02","Having thanked you for your efforts in Carteneau, the gathered heads of state proceed to explain the events following Omega's launch. After what was by all accounts a furious aerial battle, both it and the primal appear to have crashed down in Gyr Abania, and the Alliance now intends to exploit the resulting confusion by moving to secure Baelsar's Wall. Ask Alphinaud for his thoughts on these developments, and discuss your next step."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_SEQ_03","Though mindful of your recent exertions, Alphinaud suggests that you rendezvous with your fellow Scions in the East Shroud. Look for Y'shtola at Amarissaix's Spire."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_SEQ_04","You meet Krile and Y'shtola at the foot of the tower, and they relate their own account of the titanic battle in the skies over Gyr Abania. Terrifying though the spectacle must have been, a part of you cannot help wishing you had been present to see it... But even as you picture the scene, Alphinaud's inquiry about Yda's well-being draws you back to the present, and you proceed to the observation platform to find the grieving pugilist staring at the spot where the cocoon of light once hung. Yda turns at your arrival, and after appearing to come to a decision, shares the tale of her great deception, revealing at last that she is not Yda at all, but the fallen Archon's younger sister, Lyse. With her pledge to liberate Ala Mhigo still echoing in your mind, you prepare to follow Alphinaud back to the Rising Stones and the waiting Alisaie."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_SEQ_05","Upon your return, you learn that Alisaie has already been apprised of Lyse's startling secret, yet it is not this but the future which occupies her thoughts. Conscious that the Scions will inevitably be drawn into the brewing conflict in Gyr Abania, she bids you gather your strength for the coming storm...

※The next main scenario quest will be available from Alphinaud once you have met the following requirements:
※ You must have registered a product key for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood to your service account.
※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

69,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_071","You are too kind, Elder Seedseer. As I recall, we as good as demanded the right to try. But tell me: how did the battle unfold?"
70,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_072","We succeeded in waking Omega, aye, but we lost contact with the weapon shortly after it launched. From our position in the control room, we were blind to all that followed..."
71,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_MERLWYB_000_073","...What words could do justice to such a scene? None of my choosing, that much is certain. But I can give you the facts: the cocoon hatched even as Omega arrived, and from its midst rose a great dragon. The pair duly set about each other in the skies over Gyr Abania."
72,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_AYMERIC_000_074","The primal's might defied belief─it seemed the very heavens would be rent asunder by the force of its blows. And it wielded such magicks as I have never seen...and hope never to see again."
73,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_AYMERIC_000_075","The battle raged on with no end in sight, until both combatants were engulfed in a blinding flash of light. When the radiance faded, I saw the pair fall motionless from the sky, coming to rest somewhere on Ala Mhigan soil. I will not speak for the rest, but to my eye it seemed that each had landed a fatal blow upon the other..."
74,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_KANESENNA_000_076","While most among us could think only of Bahamut when looking upon the primal's form, the Domans were heard to whisper the name “Shinryu.” It would appear that the being resembles a creature of Far Eastern legend, and we have found it convenient to refer to it as such."
75,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_KANESENNA_000_077","This Shinryu's fate─and indeed, that of Omega─is yet unknown. We have, alas, no eyes on the Gyr Abanian side of the border."
76,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_RAUBAHN_000_078","Aye. Which is why we have sent our main force, under the command of Marshal Tarupin, to capture the Wall."
77,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_RAUBAHN_000_079","With the imperials in disarray, we have the perfect opportunity to secure Gridania's border, and assess the aftermath of the impact. I myself will join the marshal and his men when the council is adjourned."
78,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_080","Well, that explains a few things. I'll wager that “flash of light” coincided with our loss of contact..."
79,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_081","Lest you wonder, we quickly reengaged Omega's stasis systems, so even if it <Emphasis>has</Emphasis> fallen into the Empire's lap, it will be of no use to them─save perhaps as a statue."
80,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_NERO_000_082","Correct. Without <Emphasis>me</Emphasis> to guide their efforts, it would take them decades to decipher Omega's core functions, if they managed it at all."
81,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_KANESENNA_000_083","Such reassurances do much to calm our fears─yet the relic's fate is but one of several concerns."
82,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_AYMERIC_000_084","Indeed. I humbly submit that the time has come for us to make contact with the Resistance representatives in Gyr Abania. Though Ilberd has forced our hand, it would seem only logical to seek an alliance, given the inevitability of imperial retaliation. And by working in concert, it is not impossible that Ala Mhigo might finally be wrested from Garlemald's grasp."
83,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_RAUBAHN_000_085","I go to oversee operations at Baelsar's Wall. You have done your part─leave us to handle the initial imperial reprisal and rest while you may."
84,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_AYMERIC_000_090","This operation to take the Wall will be Ishgard's first military action under Alliance banners. Though I have no appetite for bloodshed, a part of me is glad of the chance to begin reparations for our past inaction."
85,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_MERLWYB_000_095","When the primal emerged, I was for an instant transported back to Carteneau...to the moment the black wyrm made an eighth hell of the battlefield. Gladly would I live out the rest of my days without seeing such a sight again."
86,"TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_100","If, as seems likely, we put Omega into stasis after─what did they call it? Ah, yes─after “Shinryu” was defeated, we should have little to fear from either one of them."
