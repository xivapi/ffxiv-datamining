Mogek has a message for you."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SEQ_01","The Mogmenders have begun work on a fountain for Bahrr Lehs, and as Mogek tells it, the moogle in charge has asked for you by name. Mogek insists you leave immediately to see what he would ask of you.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SEQ_02","The Mogmenders would ensure the fountain will last for centuries to come before they proceed with construction. To this end, they have taken it upon themselves to closely examine the Lost Landlord to better understand how it remains in such pristine condition. You are asked to speak with their head researcher and learn more about his findings."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SEQ_03","The methodical moogle tells you that, while it is possible to build a new fountain in the same manner as the Lost Landlord, it requires an immaculate water filter to keep the water clean. For this he requires petrified birch logs from Ohl Tahn."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SEQ_04","You scour the harsh terrain of Ohl Tahn and gather three petrified birch logs. Take them to the methodical moogle to learn how he plans to use them in the fountain."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SEQ_05","You hand over the logs which are then pulverized into a fine powder. As you begin work on a component for the fountain, the moogle researcher explains the powder mixed with other reagents will prevent corrosion and leakage. When you finish he asks that you leave the component with his helper.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the methodical moogle."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SEQ_06","You craft the component with ease and hand it over to his moogle assistant for safekeeping until construction begins. Head back to Bahrr Lehs and inform Mogek of another job well done."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SEQ_07","You return to a warm welcome from Mogek. He is certain the fountain will last no less than three millennia thanks to your contributions."

49,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_MOGEK_000_001","No doubt he's waiting for you by the fountain even as we speak. Well, don't just stand there gawping at my pom. Off you trot!"
50,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_DESIGNMOOGLE02305_000_010","Thank goodness. I was beginning to think you wouldn't come. I am happy to announce the fountain's base is all but complete, kupo. Before we proceed, however, I thought it prudent to consider how it might weather the ages once we finish."
51,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_DESIGNMOOGLE02305_000_011","The Lost Landlord, for example, was constructed over a thousand years ago. Yet the ravages of time have left not even a scratch on it. Our fountain must be just as resilient, if not more so, kupo!"
52,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_DESIGNMOOGLE02305_000_012","That's why I set my best moogles to uncovering how such a colossal monument has survived all these centuries. Though I can't say what they'll find, my pom tells me this task will require one of your expertise. Better safe than sorry, I always say."
53,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_DESIGNMOOGLE02305_000_013","Speak with the Mogmenders down at the Lost Landlord and see what they've discovered. I'm counting on you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Without a solid foundation there can be no fountain."
54,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_DESIGNMOOGLE02305_000_014","I don't know what they plan on making down there, but whatever it is, I doubt it will be much trouble for a crafter like you, kupo!"
55,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDMOOGLE02305_000_015","Can you believe this structure was built over a thousand years ago?"
56,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_RECEIPTMOOGLE02305_000_016","If I wasn't floating under its shadow, I wouldn't believe a tower this old could stay in tip-top shape."
57,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDMOOGLE02305_000_020","You must be my new crafting assistant. Good, good. I was just reading over the results of my analysis. If my data is correct─and I'll bet a sack of kupo nuts it is─we should be able to preserve our fountain much in the same way the landlords did this one."
58,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDMOOGLE02305_000_021","However, it will require a water filter of the highest quality. That's where you come in, kupo!"
59,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDMOOGLE02305_000_022","First, I need you to acquire logs from the petrified birch trees in Ohl Tahn. Three should suffice, I think. When you've brought them back we can begin."
60,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDMOOGLE02305_000_023","The trees you find there may appear queer at first glance, but I assure you they are what we need. As I said before, no need to trouble yourself with more than three logs."
61,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_030","Welcome back, my wingless assistant. I trust you found lumber suitable for our work?"
62,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_031","Yes, these will do nicely. I need but pulverize the wood like so, and...kupo! It's ready."
63,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_032","Now, I want you to follow these plans for the water filter, and coat the component with this reagent made from the petrified birch logs. It should help prevent corrosion."
64,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_033","Now, I want you to follow these plans for the water filter, and use this filler made from the petrified birch logs. It should serve to prevent leaking."
65,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_034","Now, I want you to follow this recipe using powder from the petrified birch logs to make a reagent that should keep the water filter from corroding."
66,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_035","The logs you brought back were more than enough, but if you lack for other materials I would be more than happy to prepare more, kupo! When you've finished, my assistant will see to storing what you made."
67,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_036","Is something the matter? Should you need anything please don't hesitate to ask, kupo."
68,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_037","Hmmm. Yes, everything seems to be in order. Take that over to my assistant for safekeeping. It shouldn't be long now before we can resume work on the fountain at Bahrr Lehs, kupo!"
69,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_RECEIPTMOOGLE02305_000_040","I was told someone would be delivering a component for the fountain. I take it that's you, kupo?"
70,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_RECEIPTMOOGLE02305_000_041","Oh my, what wonderful work! Making you his assistant was a wise choice indeed. Our fountain is sure to be even better than this one!"
71,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_RECEIPTMOOGLE02305_000_042","I'll keep this safe until we begin construction. You can count on me, kupo!"
72,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_PONDRESEARCHMOOGLE02305_000_043","Thanks to you, building a fountain that will last for the next thousand years should be as child's play."
73,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_DESIGNMOOGLE02305_000_044","This will be the greatest fountain the Churning Mists has ever known. Just you wait and see, kupo!"
74,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_MOGEK_000_050","And so the master <If(PlayerParameter(4))>craftswoman<Else/>craftsman</If> returns. No doubt the new fountain will stand for two─no, <Emphasis>three</Emphasis> thousand years, kupo!"
75,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_MOGEK_000_051","This is history in the making, my friend. Centuries from now, man, dragon, and moogle alike will look on it in wonder, all thanks to you."
76,"TEXT_BANMOG404_02305_SYSTEM_000_052","Normal-quality items crafted in the course of this quest serve no purpose and cannot be sold. It is recommended that you discard them."
