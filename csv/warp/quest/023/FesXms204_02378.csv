※This quest is available for a limited time only."

When you are ready, make for the innermost chamber, where Reauverre and his friends eagerly await you.

Drifting off to slumber, you are greeted in your dreams by what could only be one of the saint's little helpers. You awaken and rise to see a carefully wrapped gift sitting beneath the Starlight tree..."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS204_02378_SEQ_03","Feeling a sense of awe and wonder, you take the carefully wrapped package into hand. Could this truly be a Starlight gift sent to you by the Saint of Nymeia himself? Mayhap Damielliot might be able to offer some insight."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS204_02378_SEQ_04","With a knowing smile, Damielliot explains that the gift was prepared by the children and himself, as a show of their gratitude for the kindness you showed them this Starlight─while conceding that the vision you saw suggests that other forces may have had a hand in this miracle. Should you care to bring yet more merriment and good cheer to the younglings, you are welcome to return to the children's ward as often as you like before the season is through."
