Master Mogzin looks like he has something urgent to share with you."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_01","It seems that Gullinbursti's reaction to the statue has weighed heavy on Mogzin's mind, and the moogle wishes to discuss the issue with you and the others. Gather around Tarresson to hear the master Mogmender's thoughts on the matter.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_02","To Mogzin, it is obvious that the ancient dragon was dissatisfied, and he is determined to find out the reason. You contemplate the possibilities, and realize that none of you know why Gullinbursti demanded the statue be rebuilt in the first place. Sensing that understanding his motives might provide understanding of his discontent, you decide to find out more about him. Ohl Deeh offers to ask the dragon Vedrfolnir what he knows, and you and Mogzin depart for Anyx Trine to ask Vidofnir the same."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_03","The great white dragon reveals that Gullinbursti helped build the original Bahrr Lehs more than a thousand years past. She tells you that in the chaos following Ratatoskr's murder, the plaza was destroyed to sate the dragons' thirst for vengeance, and hints that the answer to your questions might be found in its ruins. Luckily, Mogzin remembers that piles of rubble still remain from when the Mogmenders cleared the plaza. Certain that something of use will be found among the stones, Mogzin returns to the Mogmender camp."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_04","You arrive to find Tarresson and Ohl Deeh already sifting through the rubble─evidently the two ancient dragons shared very similar stories. The four of you prepare to dig into the debris together, in the hopes of finding the key to solving this mystery."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_05","After rooting about in the rubble for some time, you find a pair of stone fragments with wind-worn lettering engraved upon them. However, it is impossible to make out any words with just the pieces in your possession. Perhaps it would be best to discuss your findings with the others."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_06","Tarresson and Ohl Deeh have discovered fragments similar to yours, and Tarresson is able to arrange them in a way that makes sense. They spell out a declaration of friendship between the three original architects of Bahrr Lehs: Marinche de Faurechort, Moggon, and Gullinbursti. It then becomes clear that this was the missing piece, and its absence was what caused Gullinbursti's cool reception to the statue. Mogzin decides to begin restoring the tablet at once, and implores you and the others to lend what assistance you can."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_07","The master Mogmender requests your aid for what might be the last time. While you are at work, Mogzin says that he will prepare one final trick. Although the idea is somewhat worrying, the best course of action for now is probably to focus on the task at hand."
8,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_08","Mogmul provides you with your supplies, and you suspect that perhaps he is not as plump as he was when work on Bahrr Lehs started. One can only imagine the feast he will throw in celebration of the statue's completion.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mogmul Mogbelly."
9,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_09","You affix the tablet to the base of the fountain, and Mogzin reveals his “trick”: a statue of a moogle, which adorns the fountain alongside the figures of man and dragon. Once again, Gullinbursti descends upon Bahrr Lehs, and all present wait in trepidation for his judgment. To your relief, the dragon exclaims his approval, and gives you his thanks for your efforts. Before departing, Gullinbursti pledges to keep the skies of Bahrr Lehs safe. With their massive undertaking finally complete, everyone in the plaza is overcome with joy. The Mogmenders' first project has been completed at last, and for a short while they can finally rest, basking in the satisfaction of a job well done."

53,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_MOGZIN_000_013","No, no, not at all, kupo! With all due respect, Tarresson, our work is far from complete. I believe you know this already─you were there when Gullinbursti saw the statue!"
54,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_OHLDEEH_000_014","I was there as well, Mogzin. Did Gullinbursti not grant us leave to remain in Bahrr Lehs? We could not have asked for more! Mogek and Mogmul have already begun preparations for a feast..."
55,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_MOGZIN_000_015","You need to look past his words, Ohl Deeh! Didn't you find his reaction strange? He seemed thoroughly unimpressed by our efforts. Something is amiss, I'm certain!"

61,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_TARRESSON_000_021","Well, I believe we did well by casting dragon and man as the subjects. Hmmm, perhaps the composition of the figures was not to his liking?"

64,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_OHLDEEH_000_025","I had wondered that myself. I know little of Gullinbursti besides the fact he is much older than Brother. He is quite reclusive, although I have been told he was not always that way."
65,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_MOGZIN_000_026","Hmmm, and we only know him by his demands. Ohl Deeh, surely there are other dragons that are friendly with him. Perhaps they could offer insight into his motives!"

83,"TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_TARRESSON_000_061","Indeed we are. Vedrfolnir only offered as much information as he deemed necessary─a quality that comes with age. It was clear, however, that the pieces of old Bahrr Lehs may hold the answer we seek."
