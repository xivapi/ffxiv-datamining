We are certainly not in Eorzea anymore."
1,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000020_TATARU","Hee hee hee! A tavern is a tavern, Alphinaud, here or anywhere else!
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time to do what I do best!"
2,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000030_HANCOCK","(-???-)Oh! A thousand pardons, my lady."
3,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000040_HANCOCK","(-???-)The Scions of the Seventh Dawn, I presume? I hope your voyage was not too trying."
4,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000050_ALISAIE","...And you are?"
5,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000060_HANCOCK","Ah, yes, of course! Forgive me. Hancock, of the East Aldenard Trading Company, at your service. On behalf of Chairman Lolorito, I bid you welcome to Kugane, and invite you to take refreshments at our local offices."
6,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000070_ALPHINAUD","Lolorito? I was aware his interests extended beyond the borders of Eorzea, but not so far as Kugane."
7,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000080_ALPHINAUD","Regardless, I am disinclined to accept the hospitality of grinning merchants─especially those who serve a master with whom we have such a difficult relationship."
8,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000090_HANCOCK","My, such naked suspicion!"
9,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000091_HANCOCK","I do hope that business with the Crystal Braves did not rob you of all faith in your fellow man. Or do you really think the chairman is plotting to drag you into another one of his grand schemes?"
10,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000100_ALPHINAUD","I beg your pardon!?
If you are trying to win my trust, you are failing quite spectacularly."
11,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000110_HANCOCK","Oh dear, have I offended you?"
12,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000111_HANCOCK","Once again, I must apologize. Too much time in the Far East, you see. One is compelled to talk in circles around everything here, and one finds oneself longing for the invigoratingly candid speech of the Ul'dahn markets...though I see now that this was neither the time nor the place to indulge said longing."
13,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000120_HANCOCK","...Might I suggest that we continue this conversation at the company offices? Too many eyes and ears here, you understand. 'Twould be decidedly reckless to say any more."
14,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000130_ALPHINAUD","If I may favor you with the invigorating candor you apparently crave─it would be decidedly reckless to follow a man I neither know nor trust. Give me one good reason why we should accept Lord Lolorito's invitation."
15,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000140_HANCOCK","Now, there's the young diplomat I was told to expect! Very well, then,
I shall explain. You understand that you are come to a most reclusive and secretive nation, yes? One whose borders are closed to foreign trade save at this single port?"
16,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000150_HANCOCK","Then it should come as no surprise that a great many parties have vested interests here. Merchants like myself are a given, of course, but for every one of us, you may be certain there is also an agent of a foreign government."
17,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000160_HANCOCK","Many notable nations and empires have embassies here, you know─including, of course, the Garlean Empire, with whom you have such a...difficult relationship."
18,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000170_ALISAIE","To paraphrase, Kugane is teeming with imperial spies, one or several of whom could now be listening to our every word."
19,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000180_HANCOCK","Something to that effect, yes. Beneath this veneer of bustling trade, a war for supremacy is being waged between world powers. One might say we were standing on the front lines...just not in public."
20,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000190_ALISAIE","I still have my doubts, but he may have a point.
I say we accept his invitation─for now."
21,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000200_HANCOCK","Our thaumaturges took great pains to ward these walls against all manner of surveillance. Where business dealings are concerned, we do not compromise on confidentiality."
22,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000210_HANCOCK","You may avail yourselves of these offices for the duration of your visit.
Come and go as you like, and know that you may speak freely here."
23,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000220_ALPHINAUD","Your offer is most generous, but I will not enter into any agreement which would leave us beholden to you or your master."
24,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000230_HANCOCK","A legitimate concern. Allow me to clarify, then: the chairman bids you consider this as an expression of his heartfelt contrition for the bloody banquet and the unpleasantness which followed."
25,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000240_HANCOCK","Never having been one to put stock in words alone, the chairman deems the provision of material aid to be a more appropriate demonstration of his sincerity."
26,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000250_HANCOCK","By sheer coincidence, your purpose here also happens to coincide with our own interests. That is, assuming you are come to aid the Doman Liberation Front?"
27,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000260_ALPHINAUD","How could─ ...Hm. I will not bother to offer a denial. Aye, you have the right of it. To be specific, we are come in search of our Far Eastern allies, Yugiri and Gosetsu, whom we hope to assist in their fight."
28,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000270_HANCOCK","The Auri shinobi and the Roegadyn samurai? Then you will be pleased to know that they have both come to Kugane."
29,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000280_LYSE","Are you sure?"
30,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000290_HANCOCK","Quite. They came here aboard a company vessel, you see. However, they encountered difficulties securing passage across the Ruby Sea."
31,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000300_LYSE","The Ruby Sea? Sorry, I've never been any good at geography."
32,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000310_HANCOCK","Forgive me. This calls for a map."
33,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000320_HANCOCK","We are here, in Kugane. The sole open port of Hingashi, situated on her western coast."
34,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000330_HANCOCK","Doma, meanwhile, is here, on the eastern coast of Othard, in Yanxia."
35,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000340_HANCOCK","Therefore, if your friends are to reach Doma, they must first cross the Ruby Sea."
36,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000350_HANCOCK","Alas, this is easier said than done as the Ruby Sea does not fall within the dominion of either Hingashi or Doma, being controlled since antiquity by a third party: namely, the Confederacy."
37,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000360_HANCOCK","Said maritime collective is known for the consummate skill of its sailors...and for demanding that any vessel entering its waters pay a toll referred to as the “Ruby Tithe.” In exchange, the Confederacy's vast fleet “guarantees the safety” of those who travel within its territory."
38,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000370_HANCOCK","Now, as I am sure you are aware, Garlemald conquered Doma some twenty-five years past, at which time the Empire saw no value in controlling the Ruby Sea. And thus did they turn a blind eye to the activities of the Confederacy."
39,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000380_HANCOCK","The recently appointed acting imperial viceroy of Doma had other ideas, however. She has formally condemned the Confederacy and declared that any who recognize their authority shall be branded enemies of the Empire."
40,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000390_HANCOCK","Bowing to this pressure, Hingashi severed ties with these toll-takers and forbade the payment of the Ruby Tithe, prompting the Confederacy to make
it known that any merchants choosing to sail the Ruby Sea would do so
at their peril..."
41,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000400_ALISAIE","No wonder they struggled to secure passage to Doma. What captain would risk such a journey given the circumstances?"
42,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000410_HANCOCK","I am told your friends were not so easily deterred from their course, but I know not whether their persistence bore fruit."
43,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000420_ALPHINAUD","I say we follow in Yugiri and Gosetsu's footsteps and attempt to secure passage to Doma for ourselves. We will need to cross the sea in any case, and we may learn something of their whereabouts in the process."
44,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000430_ALPHINAUD","And should we find that they are still in Kugane, we can make the journey together."
45,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000440_HANCOCK","In that case, I have some information which may be of use to you. No quid pro quo, I assure you─the chairman was most insistent that I aid you to the best of my ability..."
46,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000450_ALISAIE","He's late..."

This way, this way. Quickly now!"
48,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000470_ALISAIE","Enough. Where are you taking us? Where is the ship?"
49,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000480_GYODO","The ship, the ship... So very sorry to inform you, yes, yes.
Long before was it pledged to another."
50,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000490_GYODO","To me, to me! These ones are for Doma!"
51,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000500_LYSE","<sigh> I knew it couldn't be this simple..."
52,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000510_GYODO","Nothing personal, yes, yes? Just business."

I should think."
63,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000620_SOROBAN","(-Curious Kojin-)You are of the East Aldenard Trading Company, yes? Come with me.
I know a safer way."
64,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000630_HANCOCK","You are returned─and with guests, I see."
65,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000640_LYSE","Our meeting went about as well as expected. We've brought the Namazu who thought to betray us. When he wakes up, we'll see what he knows about Yugiri and Gosetsu."
66,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000650_HANCOCK","Well done you. When I saw the Sekiseigumi out in force, I did begin to worry, but I see my fears were misplaced."
67,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000660_LYSE","Actually, if it weren't for Soroban, we might not've gotten away..."
68,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000670_SOROBAN","'Twas my pleasure."
69,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000680_ALPHINAUD","Yet I must ask, Soroban: why would you deceive the Sekiseigumi to help us─foreigners of whom you know naught?"
70,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000690_SOROBAN","Why, out of the kindness of my heart...is what I would like to say, but my motives are not so pure."
71,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000700_SOROBAN","I chanced to witness your meeting with Hancock at the tavern,
and saw an opportunity."
72,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000710_HANCOCK","An opportunity?"
73,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000720_SOROBAN","Like many, I came to Kugane as a trader to make my fortune.
Kojin of the Red may serve the Empire as mercenaries, but Kojin of the Blue walk a different path."

Namely, the East Aldenard Trading Company."
76,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000750_ALPHINAUD","Quid pro quo, is it? Well, there is no denying that we owe you a debt. What say you, Hancock? Will you consider doing business with our entrepreneurial friend here?"

Allow me to explain..."
92,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000910_ALISAIE","...So, in summary: you started a brawl with some off-duty imperial soldiers and were subsequently arrested by the Sekiseigumi, whom you somehow befriended and convinced to set you free if you could defeat a given number of them in single combat?"

'Tis but a pity you came too late to witness the last one."

I gather my assistance was not required?"
