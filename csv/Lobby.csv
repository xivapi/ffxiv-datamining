Ultimately, the Elezen diverged into the two clans that exist today.

As the harsh environs of their homelands produce
little sustenance, the second- and third-born are often
sent forth from their mountain villages, with many and

blades, from daggers to longswords, be they single- or double-edged,

marry sword with shield, seeking to defend their fellow companions.
Others opt for an empty off hand, choosing instead to focus entirely
on their sword arm. In all instances, the ages-old art of the sword

To ensure you encounter the fewest number of latency issues, it is recommended,
but not required, that you select a data center that is geographically closer
to you. If you do not see your preferred World displayed, please suspend character
creation and select a different data center via the Character Selection screen
or the Data Center menu option on the title screen. Legacy Worlds (servers existing
since the original launch) are indicated in parentheses.
