peculiarly short, rounded ears. Hyurs are well suited for traveling long

conflict ensued.

Ultimately, the Elezen diverged into the two clans that exist today.
The Wildwood Elezen took to the forests to protect their homeland,

Now one of the most well-established races in the realm, Lalafells

darkness and stone.

The cave-dwelling ways of the Duskwight persist, with some

They are distinguishable from their diurnal cousins by their
darker fur, larger ears, rounder eyes, more pronounced canines,

from the islands of the far north seas, where they still
subsist as fishermen and women.

It was not until the large-scale deployment of Limsa

realm of the living.

As the harsh environs of their homelands produce
little sustenance, the second- and third-born are often
sent forth from their mountain villages, with many and
more making their way to the great cities. It is there that

evidence of decidedly dissimilar roots─the first and foremost being

skills to bear in any situation. As such, there are practitioners who

lies the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa. Its economy is driven
primarily by shipping, but boasts lucrative shipbuilding, fishing, and
smithing industries as well. To maintain the safety of its maritime
routes, the city employs a formidable navy known as the Knights
of the Barracuda. Even so, pirate bands run rampant in nearby waters,
reaving and pillaging."

cityscape is a mosaic of labyrinthine waterways and great wooden
structures, so gracefully constructed they seem a part of the
surrounding environment. The favored goddess of the citizenry is
Nophica, the Matron, but great faith is also placed in the wisdom of
the Seedseers－young oracles who guide the nation based on the
will of the forest's elementals."

the sultana who claims sovereignty, true power is wielded by the
Syndicate, a council sat by six of Ul'dah's most elite and influential.
Nald'thal is the nation's patron deity, and two great halls devoted to
His two aspects lie in the east and west of the city."
