1,"Named after a man-eating creature from Padjali folklore, the Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak was built on the site of a natural cave system beneath Silent Arbor. Until recently, it held all of Gridania's foulest criminals, from arsonists to poachers, but the completion of a new gaol closer to the city heralded its abandonment."
2,"Since its establishment during Gelmorran times, this subterranean crypt has been used for generations as a final resting place for the remains of rulers and nobles. Since the Calamity, however, the tunnels have become overrun with the Lambs of Dalamud─a deadly cult who worships the now-fallen satellite as their savior. It is in the Deepcroft that these twisted souls silently plot revenge against those who fought to prevent the advent of Dalamud, summoning any dark presence who will aid them to this end...no matter what the cost."
3,"Abandoned once purged of ore, Copperbell Mines lay untouched for nigh on three centuries until Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern reclaimed the shafts─the guild's sights set on expanding the mines downward in an attempt to tap yet undiscovered veins of valuable metal. Unfortunately, it was not riches the powder kegs uncovered, but sheer terror, for when the smoke cleared, out poured an army of raging giants from the darkest recesses of the mines. The hecatoncheires─thralls of the lost Thorne Dynasty─were, at last, free from their lightless prison, three hundred years of hate fueling their madness."
4,"After a period of relative silence following the Calamity, the Serpent Reavers have once again taken to terrorizing the inland hamlets of La Noscea─killing the men, kidnapping the women and children, plundering the storehouses, and burning what little they leave behind. For years, it was not known how the pirates were able to raid areas so far from the coast, until a local shepherd sighted a band of painted ruffians entering the Sastasha Seagrot, carrying large quantities of sacks and crates. Could it be that there is more to this cave than meets the eye?"
5,"Soon after its discovery, miners from across the realm flocked to the Aurum Vale, driven by rumors that deep within lay endless veins of mythril. What they found instead was gold, but not the sort which would make them rich. Believing the substance precious aurum, miners unknowingly stumbled into deep pools of glowing venom thereafter known as goldbile. Not only did the liquid burn their skin, but the noisome fumes given off by the foul ooze cooked their lungs when inhaled, bringing on a quick, yet excruciating death. These truths, however, have done little to prevent new miners from braving the suffocating shafts, now even more driven to find what those who entered before could not."
6,"Once used by Seedseers as a place for spiritual reflection and meditation, Haukke Manor was long frowned upon by the people of Gridania as a symbol of excess. After years of protest, the building was finally sold to a wealthy Wildwood Elezen by the name of Lady Amandine.

While little is known of the lady, it was said that she was exceptionally vain, and that to maintain her impeccable beauty, she would spare no expense. From facial creams concocted from rare Coerthan honeys to shampoos derived from the milk of exotic phurbles, her daily ritual of beauty treatments escalated until it was rumored she was bathing in the blood of her virgin maidservants. No amount of man-made tinctures, however, could hide the hideous scars she eventually suffered during the Calamity, and soon she was forced to turn to a darker solution, signing away her very soul in a final effort to literally “save face.”"
7,"Originally a holy place for the first Lalafell arrived in Eorzea, the twisting labyrinth of natural caverns which wind through this massive mesa was transformed by the Gladiators' Guild into a series of training pits, animal pens, and holding cells to accommodate the ever-growing popularity of Ul'dah's Coliseum. After the Calamity, however, the location was abandoned─those remaining in the pens, left for dead. Not all of them, however, met that fate, and now the tunnels are rife with those who survived...as well as the tormented spirits of those who did not."
8,"After a tiring journey across Eorzea, it is deep within the quiet jungles of Raincatcher Gully where the charismatic and enterprising young goblin, Brayflox Alltalks, chooses to build her tiny empire. What she does not realize, however, is that something else─something sinister─has also made the lush forest its home. Now driven from their rightful(?) claim, Brayflox and her brethren seek to retake the land, and are not above asking the help of lesser races (that would be you) to help them do so."
9,"Under the unforgiving Thanalan sun lie the ruins of an ancient temple half-devoured by the shifting sands of a timeless desert. Though used by ancient Belah'dians as a place to worship the sun goddess, Azeyma, portions of the massive underground structure appear to be far older than this Sixth Astral Era civilization. That, however, did not deter Belah'dian sultans from each adding their own chambers to the original construct in a bid to achieve immortality through creation. In the subsequent years since the fall of Belah'dia, many an adventurer has sought to explore the temple's mysteries and perhaps return with the treasure of a lost era...only to fall victim to one of the complex traps set to prevent that very thing from happening."
10,"Decades of kobold mining deep beneath O'Ghomoro gradually weakened upper La Noscea to the point that when the Calamity struck, the land surrounding Bronze Lake collapsed, draining its waters and revealing a palace of unparalleled beauty. Thought to have been built by the Nymian civilization, which thrived in the area some fifteen centuries ago, the palace appears to have been dedicated to their patron deity, Oschon, the Wanderer. In search of the bounty she may hold, treasure hunters have already begun to delve into this forsaken place...but will treasure be the only thing they find?"
11,"One of four watchtowers built along the Sea of Clouds by the city–state of Ishgard, the Stone Vigil was overrun and occupied by the Dravanian Horde not long after the Calamity. The following years have seen the knights of House Durendaire make several attempts at reclaiming the fortress, but to no avail. What could it be that thwarts their every effort?"
12,"Near an old mountain path once used by Sixth Astral Era woodcutters as a detour through the more perilous stretches of northern Thanalan, lies a cave sought out only by the ignorant or the foolish. Upon first glance, the shade of its maw might appear inviting to one who seeks to escape the punishing rays of the midday sun. However, any good woodcutter knows to keep his distance, for it is said that those who enter never return─the cries of the damned echoing up from the depths the only testament to their folly. Heed this dire warning, and you may live. Ignore it, and soon it shall be your screams that add to the cacophony."
13,"Seeking to utilize an existing labyrinth of natural caves, the Ishgardian house of Dzemael began construction on their eponymous Darkhold near the end of the Sixth Astral Era, intending it to serve as a refuge for those fleeing the flames of the Dravanian Horde. When the house's digging uncovered an entrance to the void, allowing an army of voidsent into this realm, however, they immediately abandoned their plans and withdrew from the subterrane, sealing it off so that they might contain the otherworldly invaders within. Despite all this, the house is unwilling to relinquish its claim to the caves, and believes that if they can be cleared of the voidsent, they might still be able to see their original plan brought to fruition."
14,"Once, the lost civilization of Amdapor thrived in the Twelveswood, her citizens wielders of powerful, yet forbidden magicks which could be used to alter the very fabric of existence. However, as is oft the case with peoples who fancy themselves gods, the self-assuring hubris of the Amdapori eventually became their downfall, and as quickly as they rose to power, did they disappear from the world. For generations, this relic of their once-mighty civilization has remained hidden in plain sight─cloaked by the elementals who sought only to prevent newer generations from stumbling across the ancient Amdapori magicks. That is, until the Lambs of Dalamud─a dark cult who worships the now-fallen lesser moon as a god─dispelled the elementals' glamour by means unknown, and claimed the keep as their own. Now the crazed followers use its ancient chambers to perform blood sacrifices in an effort to resurrect their evil lord."
15,"So begins the third phase of Operation Archon, which entails a frontal assault upon Castrum Meridianum, Gaius van Baelsar's seat of power. Forming the main thrust, the Immortal Flames will strike at the stronghold with all their strength, though this is but a feint. While the garrison's eyes are drawn outwards, you and your comrades must steal past its defenses and attempt to deactivate the magitek field which protects the Praetorium, the fortress within a fortress wherein the Ultima Weapon is believed to be housed."
16,"With the magitek field now out of commission, the path to the Ultima Weapon lies open. While the Immortal Flames sweep Castrum Meridianum and suppress the remnants of the enemy garrison, you and your comrades must fight your way to the innermost sector of the Praetorium, there to locate and destroy the Ultima Weapon. Cid's airship, the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, will bear you to the stage of the final confrontation."
17,"The once-proud Pharos Sirius is twice dishonored─once by the Calamity, and now by the deadly siren of Umbra, who plots to hold the lighthouse as a personal stronghold with the aid of her minions. Silence her lunatic song, dispatch the usual suspects─ashkin and winged monstrosities─and reclaim the light of the civilized world."
18,"Huzzah, back to the mines! Adventurers have cleared Copperbell Mines of hecatoncheires─or have they? A band of engineers from Amajina & Sons has gone missing in the deep shaft, cut off mid-knock: “ON SCHEDULE. HELP HEC─”. A more thorough adventurer is needed to mop up the enduring giants, if pickaxes are to ring again underground and the gil to flow overground."
19,"Scarred by the Calamity and warped by vanity, the lady of House Dartancours has made a bargain with the voidsent─and lost her soul, as is so often the case with such sketchy arrangements. Now, her manor house is a lair to all manner of dark beings, and the elite band of Wood Wailers sent to purge them has failed to report back. A second try is now in the works."
20,"Brayflox's Longstop is overrun with forces of the Illuminati; the furious goblin scholars are bent on recovering a secret recipe centuries in the making and a moment in the filching. Having been pressed into service as Brayflox's boon companion, you have no choice but to disregard the facts of her thievery and defend the Longstop from all those who would seize it from its rightful holder."
21,"Halatali! The very name turns some spines to water and others to steel. Lurid marks of the recent lawlessness yet remain, but daily the drudges conquer halls slick with ichor and doorways festooned with things not for gentle eyes. No less deadly for its newly restored order, the fabled training grounds yearn for new blood─perhaps to brighten the freshly scrubbed walls of its vast chambers."
22,"Born in magic, the ancient city of Amdapor lived in splendor and died in agony. As the Fifth Astral Era gave way to the Sixth Umbral and the ensuing catastrophe, the agent of Amdapor's destruction slept. Now, the seal that has held so long is softening like windfallen fruit─and what blind worms writhe underneath the skin of the dead city?"
23,"Upon the Rhotano Sea, along the fringes of the island chain known as the Cieldalaes, there stretches an expanse of water perpetually covered in heavy mist. Hidden within this impenetrable shroud is Hullbreaker Isle, so named for having smashed innumerable hapless vessels into flotsam over the centuries. In the wake of the Calamity, however, it came to be that the mist would lift under certain conditions. On one such day, a merchantman sailed into the area to behold not only the isle itself, but also the wreck of the <Emphasis>Haar</Emphasis>, the flagship of the dread pirate Mistbeard. The discovery has rekindled interest in Mistbeard's legendary hoard, and treasure hunters the realm over are now scrambling to find passage to the elusive isle."
24,"When the guiding light of one's life is extinguished, it takes uncommon strength of spirit to clamber out of the black pits of despair. Those who want for resilience may yet be pulled up by a friend's helping hand, but what becomes of a broken-hearted maiden who has neither the strength nor the succor to overcome the darkness that threatens to consume her? The answer shall be revealed through the tragic tale that begins with the arrival of a single letter..."
25,"Too long has the Stone Vigil been ravished by the Dravanians and their thralls; too long has House Durendaire suffered this infamy. Time has come for its dragoons to retake the fortress, ten hundred lances and a thousand dreams of vengeance strong.

Though the knights of Ishgard breach the gate to find a lodgment within the Vigil, the enemy is well defended and amply supplied. This deadlock must be broken─and who better than those who once made free of the fortress under the dragons' very noses, and lived to tell the tale?"
26,"Adventurers fear not danger, scholars care not for comfort, and miners like not unturned stones. Thus was born the unlikely partnership between the Order of Nald'thal and Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern, in the wake of a certain adventurer's conquest of the Sunken Temple's notorious traps. But the dead of Qarn left many snares─more than enough for a thousand years of greed─and now, a tomb raider's fevered dream of riches has stranded the joint expedition in a place where history has a tendency to come alive..."
27,"Formed in the aftermath of the Calamity, the great ice wall has long been thought an impenetrable barrier between central and western Coerthas. In truth, however, the wall is riddled with hidden tunnels, which Iceheart and her followers have used as a base of operations. You have been tasked with exploring one such tunnel in the hopes that it will lead you to the heretics' leader─yet what dangers await are anyone's guess..."
28,"Tucked deep inside the dank caverns of the Sastasha Seagrot, there is a secret port said to have been built by the pirate Mistbeard. In the years following the Calamity, the notorious Serpent Reavers claimed it as their lair, until the cutthroats were vanquished by a band of dauntless adventurers. The place subsequently came under the control of Lominsan authorities, who maintained a security presence within.

Alas, that control did not last, for an unknown faction has arisen─seemingly from the briny depths─and overwhelmed the occupying Yellowjackets. Opinion is divided over the identity of these foes. Some say that they are pirates, while others swear that they are fiends. Yet it does not take a scholar to see that these two things need not be mutually exclusive."
29,"Though purging the Lambs of Dalamud brought a hard-earned peace unto Amdapor Keep, some mysterious fiend has completed the cultists' rites and ushered shadows back into the ruins. Voidsent now revel anew within these walls, their wickedness warping the flora and transforming kindly woodland creatures to bloodthirsty beasts. For the sake of the Twelveswood and the elementals who keep watch over it, you must cleanse the evil from the keep, and sweep away all traces of the cultists."
30,"Bound no more by the rancor of their fallen king, the tonberries have regained their senses─with a little help from devoted friends. Yet all thoughts of peace have been put to the blade, as a band of Mamool Ja mercenaries known as the Silverscales have stormed the walls and seized the place for their own. Someone must stop the sellswords from turning the Wanderer's Palace into an unassailable fortress, and take a stand against tonberry slaughter and slavery!"
31,"Built by the learned men and women of Sharlayan, the Great Gubal Library is the grandest repository of knowledge in all of Eorzea. Lining its towering shelves are tomes beyond count, gathered from the farthest reaches of the realm. Like the city–state, however, the library was abandoned by its caretakers when they fled to their motherland in the face of Garlean invasion. And now, fifteen years since its doors were sealed, you will be the first soul to set foot within its halls. Your destination is the forbidden section deep within the library, where lies your objective: the fruits of Matoya's research on the aetheric converger."
32,"Fifteen years ago, in the skies above Silvertear Falls, the invading forces of the XIVth Legion were set upon by a host of dragons. Leading the charge was Midgardsormr, legendary king of kings, who engaged the Garlean flagship, the <Emphasis>Agrius</Emphasis>, in battle. In the end, both Midgardsormr and his foe fell to the earth, and their tangled remnants stand as a memorial to that day─a ruined airship, and the charred corpse of the wyrm lord who brought it low, forever devoid of life..."
33,"Sonu Vanu, chief of the Zundu, faces a tempestuous predicament. Already facing an upwind battle to shelter his people from the warlike Vundu, his mask─the traditional symbol of power in Vanu Vanu society─has grown old and worn. Should it crack, and his authority with it, the peaceful tribe would be powerless to stave off the coming storm. Venture into Neverreap─the sacred isle of the Vanu Vanu that has been overrun by the Vundu and the vicious beasts in their thrall─and emerge with the scale of a mighty waukkeon, that the sun might shine on the Zundu once more!"
34,"Ser Aymeric's attempt to bring the truth of the Dragonsong War to light has ended in failure. Imprisoned by the archbishop under suspicion of heresy, he now languishes in the gaol underneath the Vault. Yet all is not yet lost, for Lucia has hatched a bold plan to see justice done. While her party frees Ser Aymeric from captivity, you are to lead a party into the highest levels of the Vault and seize Thordan VII. Though the knights of the Heavens' Ward will attempt to bar your passage, you must press on, for the future of Ishgard hangs in the balance!"
35,"Wedge is a man with a dream─a dream that Gilly, the kindly guidance node who escorted you through the aetheric wastes of Azys Lla might be restored to life, to blip to him once more. To that end, he'll need you to fetch her a new nacelle from the Fractal Continuum, a museum of Allagan technological creations that will open its doors to welcome its first visitor in some five millennia..."
36,"In the days following the Calamity, western Coerthas was abandoned by the knights of Ishgard, save for the Dusk Vigil, whose defenders refused to withdraw. Since then, the fortress has only fallen further into disrepair, and her garrison has long since been presumed dead.

Unlike most Ishgardians, who would sooner put the tragic episode behind them, Father Wealdtheow would have you enter the forsaken fortress and reclaim a priceless treasure: an ice rondel set in the helm of a sculpture within the Vigil's chapel. A simple request, perhaps, but if experience has taught you anything, such tasks are anything but..."
37,"Sohm Al. Casting its shadow over the Dravanian forelands, this towering peak is revered by the dragons as both holy ground and resting place. And now, in accordance with your pact, Vidofnir has thrown open to you the final ascent to the sacred mount's summit. But Nidhogg's minions will not lightly suffer this intrusion. Ere you gaze upon the fabled expanse of the Churning Mists, you must first carve a path through the mountain's denizens and overcome the consort of Nidhogg, herself─the she-dragon, Tioman."
38,"Your pursuit of the archbishop has brought you to the Aetherochemical Research Facility, at the heart of the floating isle of Azys Lla. However, he and his knights are not the only threat for which you must be prepared; shortly before your arrival, the VIth Imperial Legion entered the facility in search of the secret to mastering primals, and their presence will serve to complicate matters. With multiple factions and their ambitions set on a collision course, your mission promises to be fraught with danger and uncertainty both."
39,"Sensing the death of his consort, a wary Nidhogg has surrounded his lair with a wall of tempestuous winds. After calling upon the assistance of Cid and his ingenious engineers, however, you and Estinien are now ready to breach this howling barrier on the wings of their latest airship prototype─the manacutter. Join the Azure Dragoon on this, the greatest of wyrm hunts, and mount a direct assault upon the Aery. Only with the death of Nidhogg can you ensure the preservation of Ishgard...and bring an end to the Dragonsong War."
40,"Pharos Sirius, the pride of Limsa Lominsa, is yet again in peril. The fine men and women of Naldiq and Vymelli's were restoring the interior when they were taken by surprise by a pack of kobolds and their explosive arsenal. Barely escaping with their lives, the smiths sounded the alarum on the worrying plethora of bombs scattered throughout the lighthouse. Maelstrom Command enlists your aid, but proceed with caution—with one misplaced explosion, Pharos Sirius could be blown to smithereens!"
41,"Saint Mocianne's Arboretum once housed the greatest collection of flora and fauna the realm had ever known. Alas, in the wake of the exodus it was left to the elements, and the wildlife within now roams its halls unchecked and untamed. A band of treasure hunters hopes to brave this leafy labyrinth in search of a cache more valuable than gold, that could ensure Idyllshire's prosperity for years to come. But will their search of this savage garden yield fortune, or end in failure?"
42,"This battle exercise will test your ability to manage multiple parties of enemies.

Learn to draw single targets from groups using ranged attacks and engage them in locations far out of the lines of sight of other creatures."
43,"Bockman, a wandering revenant trapped in the corporeal realm, has reclaimed his legendary suit of armor and now waits silently near the Tam–Tara Deepcroft for any who would challenge him. Not only does the undead knight brandish a massive blade capable of incapacitating multiple victims in one fell stroke, but when threatened, Bockman will summon his decaying minions from the pits of the seventh hell.

Defeat the restless soul, and send him back to the Lifestream where he may, at long last, find peace."
44,"This battle exercise will test your ability to breach enemy stronghold defenses.

Eliminate targets in each of the three antechambers before infiltrating the final chamber and engaging the cyclopean toad who makes the cave its den. Making quick work of the creature is key, for the yarzons who lurk behind the chamber's boulders will emerge once they smell blood."
45,"Wealthy noble Teledji Adeledji has had his prized pet, a rare gil turtle, kidnapped by ruthless bandits who seek a sizable ransom for the gentle wavekin's return. Always a man of principle, Teledji Adeledji has decided that instead of caving to the bandit's demands, he will offer the ransom to anyone who can safely retrieve his pet from the clutches of evil.

After weakening the gil turtle, slay fire sprites and use their cores to light a special herb on fire. The smoke released should be powerful enough to put the creature to sleep, but only if the turtle is close enough to the flames."
46,"The forest's landtraps have reached maturity and begun releasing noisome pollen clusters in their efforts to reproduce. When taken into the lungs, the pollen can cause severe irritation, nausea, and in the case of extended exposure, even death. These vile seedkin must be dealt with before the entire Twelveswood is engulfed in a cloud of despair!"
47,"A notorious band of outlaws known as the Redbelly Wasps is seeking to establish a new hideout near the Thousand Maws of Toto–Rak.

Once the leader is attacked, he will summon nearby allies to his aid, including powerful conjurers skilled in the arts of healing. Defeating these allies before engaging their leader will greatly increase your chance of success."
48,"Hostile sylphs who would rather see the Twelveswood burn before making peace with the people of Gridania have begun using their forbidden magicks to charm the forest's creatures into doing their bidding. Temporarily enhanced by the spells, these turned creatures now possess the ability to enfeeble their victims with terrible poisons and wide-reaching attacks.

Only by slaying the renegade sylph leader Briaxio of the Well will the creatures' minds be freed."
49,"A lawless cadre of goblins has seized the Matron's Lethe, preventing passage to and from the upper reaches of the Twelveswood. Now, all those who approach are greeted with a shower of time-activated bombs tossed from behind makeshift barricades.

Slay the goblins, defeat their leader, and reclaim the area, so that travel through the forest will be safe once again."
50,"A massive tangle of vivified briar and vines known by the locals as Toxic Tamlyn has taken root in Fool Falls and is poisoning the water which flows into the Nym River, and eventually down to the Rhotano Sea and Limsa Lominsa. The morbol must be slain before the city–state's entire freshwater supply is contaminated, but to do so will require entering an area churning with deadly bubbles that release noisome fumes and bloodthirsty denizens of the deep."
51,"A terrible creature calling itself Buso has made a nearby mineshaft his new home away from the void. Slay the fiend before he can do whatever it is he came from the dark reaches of the outerworld to do.

Buso draws his power from eerie blue flames which erupt from the carcasses of minions summoned from the void and then sacrificed here in this realm. While these flames burn, Buso will be nigh indestructible. Extinguish the fires before attempting to engage him."
52,"To the east of Dragonhead, near the southern cliffs of the Sea of Clouds, a significant rift in the aether has been detected. Through this rift, a massive horned demon and a small army of its invincible minions have appeared, posing a threat to the Ishgardian knights stationed at the outposts nearby. For the time being, the creatures appear content with remaining on their rocky outcropping, but for how long they will remain is uncertain. Engage the voidsent, ignoring the incessant hounding of the minions, and focusing your efforts on their leader."
53,"At first, the now-frequent deadly avalanches in the Coerthas highlands were written off as displays of Oschon's might. That is, until local mountaineers spotted a giant bomb sending smaller explosives up onto the Nail to self-destruct, triggering massive cataracts of snow and rock. Knowing now the true cause of the matter, the Holy See has put a bounty on the floating head of this “bomb queen.” The task of regicide, however, will not be an easy one, for she is attended to by a retinue of royal subjects who are ready to serve her in any way necessary─including self-destruction."
54,"Five voidsent demons have descended into the Singing Shards, devouring the souls of any and all who cross their path. Early attempts at slaying the creatures have all ended in failure, for as long as one survives, it will continuously summon the fallen back to its side.

If a party were able to somehow time the killing blows necessary to fell all five of the creatures at once, victory may be possible. However, the demons will try and stop this by employing a combination of complex battle formations to thwart their pursuers' plans."
55,"The gigants are made up of three distinctive classes: the ruling class of gigas, the slave class of giants, and the hecatoncheires─a second class of slaves who have spent the past several centuries trapped in a sealed mine. The enmity between the classes runs deep, and when any two converge, sparks will fly. But, when all three converge...the results can be devastating.

Parties from all three of the gigant classes have stumbled onto a dig site of the Sons of Saint Coinach. The researchers have all fled to safety, but the artifacts they discovered remain on the field. Slay the intruders while protecting the relics from needless destruction."
56,"Owing to a betrayal, you have been captured by the Amalj'aa and taken to their stronghold of Zanr'ak, there to be given as an offering to the primal Ifrit. If you are to survive this fiery encounter with the Lord of the Inferno, you and your comrades must fight with no less than every onze of your strength. Should you fall, your souls shall burn for eternity..."
57,"Having passed the seemingly endless trials imposed upon you by the Company of Heroes, you have been entrusted with the knowledge of a secret way into the Navel, the domain of the primal Titan. Courtesy of Y'shtola's magicks, the beastman aetheryte is now primed to send you to a confrontation with the Lord of Crags. Gird your loins for a struggle of titanic proportions."
58,"With the aid of the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> and its legendary captain, Cid Garlond, you have broken through the swirling winds that shield the Howling Eye. Yet the challenges you have surmounted pale in comparison to the one that awaits you beyond the gates. At long last, the end is nigh─be it Garuda's or your own. "
59,"While your victory over the Ultima Weapon has set off waves of celebration across the land, the jubilation is short-lived, for the beast tribes are seeking to summon their gods once more. Confirmation has arrived that the Amalj'aa have already succeeded in calling forth Ifrit, who is returned far mightier than his last incarnation owing to the vast amounts of crystals he has gorged upon. Prepare yourself for a scorching encounter."
60,"From deep within their mines, the kobolds have watched and waited for another opportunity to summon their Great Father and wreak havoc on Limsa Lominsa. With the destruction of the Ultima Weapon, the final obstacle to their plans was removed, allowing the beastmen to summon their god without fear of imperial reprisal. Once more, it falls to you to ensure that the Lord of Crags never sees the light of day."
61,"Not to be outdone by the Amalj'aa, the Ixal have also taken advantage of the Ultima Weapon's destruction and again summoned their patron deity. What is worse, this most recent incarnation of Garuda is said to possess a nigh-insatiable appetite for destruction. If Coerthas and the Twelveswood are to be spared further destruction, you must return to the Howling Eye and seek an audience with the Lady of the Vortex."
62,"It has come to light that Rhitahtyn sas Arvina, praefectus castrorum of the XIVth Legion, is scheduled to inspect the imperial outpost at Cape Westwind. Although native to a territory subjugated by the Empire, Rhitahtyn's prowess as a field tactician has won him a station of great authority within the Garlean military. Such a formidable enemy general will surely prove an obstacle to the Alliance's efforts to purge the realm of the imperial menace. For the first phase of Operation Archon, you have been entrusted the mission of infiltrating the imperial outpost and striking him down."
63,"Having partaken further of Ascian wisdom, the Amalj'aa have succeeded in summoning the mightiest incarnation of their god to date. Ifrit has returned amidst hellfire and brimstone, and the lizardmen bask in the heat of destruction as warriors of the Immortal Flames fall to the primal like slugs shriveling beneath the desert sun. Can a Warrior of Light prevail against such an irrepressible force?"
64,"When northern Vylbrand is racked by an earthquake, Urianger Augurelt suspects the kobolds of summoning the primal Titan. The Scion of the Seventh Dawn is proven irritatingly correct in short order when the Lord of Crags appears in the mountains of O'Ghomoro to flaunt powers even greater than were supposed. It does not take an augur to see that a battle to the death must soon follow."
65,"An attack by the primal Garuda has annihilated an entire Twin Adder brigade, with the sole survivor left to tell a tale writ in terror and misery. Garuda's powers are far greater than they should be; left with few options and all but one of them almost certain failures, the Order of the Twin Adder turns to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, so that they may summon a Warrior of Light."
66,"Good King Moggle Mog, the Twelfth of His Name, has once more been called forth by the Mogglesguard. Though the king is not considered a primal in the strictest sense, he poses a threat not unlike that of the beastman gods, in that his influence could corrupt his people's peaceful nature. And so, like those other aether-starved beings, he too must be felled for the sake of the realm."
67,"Kuplo Kopp's attempt to chastise the Mogglesguard for their dangerous and foolhardy actions has not had the intended effect. Reminded of how deadly the Twelveswood has become, the royal guards have instead channeled their fear and desperation into calling forth an even more potent potentate. The Good King Moggle Mog XII now styles himself the Great King Moggle Mog XII, and all the evildoers in the forest shall tremble before his majestic wrath!"
68,"Inspired by tales of your victory over the Ultima Weapon, the wandering minstrel come to Revenant's Toll has composed an epic ballad in your honor. However, as minstrels are wont to do, he has embellished certain details for dramatic effect. Although it can hardly be considered an accurate retelling, you cannot deny his skill with words, for as you listen to his melodious voice, you find yourself reliving the events of that fateful day in the Praetorium... "

72,"The Sahagin, reviled beast tribe native to the Indigo Deep, have succeeded in summoning forth their voracious god, the primal Leviathan. Should the mighty serpent be allowed to unleash a tidal wave, the entire city of Limsa Lominsa will be swept into the sea. Faced with watery oblivion, the leaders of the Maelstrom have conceived a desperate plan: by lashing together two warships and filling their holds with corrupted crystals, they hope to pierce the Lord of the Whorl's defenses and give a chosen few the chance to dispatch the primal with courage and steel. The <Emphasis>Whorleater</Emphasis> sits in the bay with her towing vessel, the <Emphasis>Triumph</Emphasis>, awaiting but the command to cast off. "
73,"Though their beloved god was slain at the hands of the Warrior of Light, the Sahagin have wasted little time in mourning his passing. Drawing on the occult knowledge of the Ascians, the scaly beastmen have performed a foul ritual fueled by blood and sacrifice to bring forth the mightiest incarnation of Leviathan the realm has yet seen. Before the ocean deity can summon a tidal wave of catastrophic proportions, the <Emphasis>Whorleater</Emphasis> must once again set sail for open waters─and for victory."
74,"There are as many theories as the dhorme chimera has heads about why the creature consumes alumina. Some say the uniquely fine alumina salts to be found in its capacious stomach are an accident of friction and heat, while others claim intent. Those such as Gerolt, who forge anew the arms of eld, have a simpler question: will you slay the fire-breathing enigma?"
75,"Left to starve in their abandoned training grounds, the fighting beasts of Halatali have survived on the flesh of the unprepared these past five years. Some have prospered more than others in the abattoir gloom; the hydra reposes fat and malignant, an apt pupil for your yet unfinished relic. Seek out this foul orphan of the Calamity, and let the bards sing of it.

※You cannot change weapons once bound by duty. Please ensure that you have equipped your unfinished relic weapon if you are undertaking this trial in order to complete the quest “A Relic Reborn.”"
76,"In his quest to acquire the strongest of weapons, the notorious duelist Gilgamesh has long eluded authorities─until now. Forced to take a stand at the impassable Griffin Crossing, he has challenged you to a “duel.” Triumph, and he shall yield his latest prize. But should you fail, your weapons will be forfeit."
77,"After forging deep into the Sylphlands, you meet with the intimidating guardian deity of the sylphs─the primal Ramuh. But before he will consider your proposal of peace, the Lord of Levin first demands proof that you possess the strength required to repel the Empire from the Twelveswood. The thunderous entity then vanishes in a blinding flash, leaving the words of his challenge yet echoing in your ears. Enter the primal's domain, and prepare to be measured on the scales of battle!"
78,"Satisfied that the Warrior of Light has passed his trial, the primal Ramuh departs Eorzea for the aetherial sea. His sylvan thralls, however, unconvinced that their territory is truly safe, have focused their deep-rooted fear and spite into summoning their god anew. Can you rise to the challenge and prove your might once again? Crackling with the vengeful energies of his children's prayers, the Lord of Levin's judgment promises to be harsh indeed..."
79,"For as long as their nation has warred with Dravania, there have been Ishgardians who instead chose to ally themselves with the dragons. Shiva is said to have been among the first, hence why the heretics revere her as a saint. That Iceheart and her followers intend to summon Shiva with the crystals they have stolen is plain. But is this unprecedented act even possible? If so, then Ishgard─if not the entire realm─is in grave danger."
80,"House Durendaire's efforts to establish an outpost in Snowcloak have met with disaster, owing to a surprise attack by Iceheart's followers. Now in possession of their former fortress, as well as a vast supply of crystals, the heretics are certain to summon Saint Shiva once more. If past experience is any indication, this new incarnation will be stronger than the last. Regardless, it changes nothing─ Iceheart's crusade cannot continue, and only you have the power to stop her."
81,"It's a frenetic free-for-all as the Mythril Cup moves to Halatali for the climactic confrontation! Rain will lash and winds will bluster in this perfect storm of a battle. When the tempest subsides, who will rise above the chaos to lay claim to the victor's spoils? Will it be the Warrior of Light, savior of Eorzea and champion of her people, or the dastardly duo of Ultros and Typhon!? All will be answered in Halatali, atop the Dragon's Neck!"
82,"In the moons following the Calamity, myriad rumors of ghastly creatures stalking the Twelveswood began spreading across the realm like wildfire. While most of the rumors have since been deemed unfounded, there is one series of events that has remained difficult to cast off as merely the ravings of broken-minded smallfolk: that concerning the supposed Dark Rider of the Shroud. After several deaths attributed to this mysterious figure, Seedseer O-App-Pesi sought communion with the spirits of the Twelveswood, only to learn that the rider was none other than the elder primal Odin. Slain in the Third Astral Era by an Allagan hero, why and how the primal has returned to Eorzea remains a mystery─one now in the capable hands of Eorzea's adventurers."
83,"The Steps of Faith─the sole means of approaching the city of Ishgard. As well as providing passage across the Sea of Clouds, this great stone bridge also serves to anchor the series of arcane wards known as Daniffen's Collar.

Long has the Holy See relied upon these barriers to shield the city from Dravanian assault, but it did not reckon upon the brazen actions of Lady Iceheart. The outermost layer of protection has been dispelled, allowing the mighty dragon Vishap to land upon the far end of the Steps of Faith. Leading an army of lesser kin, the massive creature is intent on destroying the exposed foundations of the remaining wards. Take up position alongside the Temple Knights, and defend the structure from the ravaging forces of the Horde!"
84,"A ruthless Ascian known as Nabriales has intruded upon the sanctum of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, spiriting away both the Antecedent and the powerful relic she refused to yield. Pursue the Paragon through the dimensional rift and prise Minfilia─and Tupsimati─from his tenebrous grasp."
85,"How many realms has he traversed, and how many rivals has he felled? Gilgamesh journeys ever onward in his unending quest for the strongest of weapons. But the road is long and lonesome, and a painted rooster─loyal and noble as the bird may be─can bring a man only so much comfort in the darkest and most trying of times. So it was that Gilgamesh turned to the heavens, pleading to be reunited with a long-lost companion. Be it by fortune or fate, his prayers were heard, and the stage for the final confrontation is set. To the victor goes the Treaty-Blade!"
86,"An insectoid beast tribe connected by a hive mind, the Gnath have but one collective desire: to expand their territory and prosper without fear of dragons. It was by this simple yet powerful wish that a mighty primal bent on war and conquest was summoned into existence. Bound by your promise to Vidofnir to remove this threat to dragonkind, you must now lead your companions into battle against the savage entity known as Ravana, Lord of the Hive."
87,"Willed back into existence by his zealous children, Ravana, the Lord of the Hive, is risen again with ever greater savagery. Left unchecked, the Wrath of the Colony will surely seek out the Warring Triad on Azys Lla to feed upon the sleeping eikons' strength. Heed Unukalhai's warning, and slay the entity before his insatiable appetite for power unleashes destruction of cataclysmic proportions..."
88,"Inspiration often finds us in surprising ways. So it was that a casual mention of skyfishing helped Cid Garlond conceive a plan to lure out Bismarck, the Lord of the Mists, by using the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> to tow an island through the Sea of Clouds. After binding the beast with chains fired from dragonkillers, he hopes you can engage it in the traditional fashion. Though the plan is somewhat sound in theory, there is no telling how effective it will be in practice. Nevertheless, the engineer has seen you through many dangerous situations in the past, so at least the odds are in his favor..."
89,"As is all too often the case, a primal you felled has once again been summoned. According to Unukalhai, the stakes are even higher this time, as Bismarck's reappearance threatens to hasten the awakening of the Warring Triad─three eikons sealed within the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla. Fortunately, you have developed a sound method for slaying flying feathered whales. The <Emphasis>Enterprise Excelsior</Emphasis> and your island await."
90,"Taking the soul of the legendary King Thordan into his flesh, the archbishop transforms into a primal before your very eyes. Sustained by a millennium of prayer and the Eye's aether, he declares his intent to rule over the world with an iron fist and for all time. Standing at his side are the sworn brothers of the Heavens' Ward, who have likewise transcended their mortal limits by becoming incarnations of the knights twelve. Strike them down, and eradicate the root of the Dragonsong War."
91,"With his typical flair for embellishment, the wandering minstrel has woven yet another stirring epic─this time from the threads of your Azys Lla confrontation with Archbishop Thordan VII. With the final verse yet ringing in the chambers of your mind, the memories of that titanic struggle arise once more with an almost surreal clarity..."
92,"With the help of Cid nan Garlond, members of the expedition to the Crystal Tower have successfully penetrated the defenses of the Eight Sentinels. The ancient Allagan structure is not so easily entered, however, and the Labyrinth of the Ancients now awaits the fellowship of NOAH as they seek the ultimate prize."
93,"Situated upon Vylbrand, Castrum Occidens is more akin to a research facility than a fortress. Even before its first pillar was driven into the ground, Legatus Gaius van Baelsar had ordered his people to probe the fragment of Dalamud which fell at that precise location. The impact resulted in the creation of vast caverns pervaded by corrupted crystals. Though unknown dangers lie in wait within, you must brave them all if you are to learn the truth of the Calamity."
94,"At the depth of 912 yalms, you find your path blocked by Dalamud's internal defenses. Born of advanced Allagan science, these spherical constructs are still fully functional even after eras in existence, and will seek to annihilate all intruders or be destroyed in attempt."
95,"At the depth of 1,233 yalms, your party comes upon the fragment of Dalamud the Garleans had sought. Its true identity is the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis>, a colossal starship which fell away from the lesser moon moments before Bahamut burst free of his prison over the Carteneau Flats. To reach your destination, you must venture through this relic of ancient Allag. Stay ever on your guard, for every shadow may conceal dangers."
96,"At 1,524 yalms below the surface, employing the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis>'s drive cylinder as a makeshift lift, your party proceeds toward the main bridge. Yet you must work for every yalm you gain, for Dalamud's internal defenses will not allow you to pass unmolested."
97,"Having overcome the seemingly endless waves of hostile constructs, you and your stalwart companions continue the descent into an unknown abyss. At the depth of 1,910 yalms, you are assailed by a winged terror: an ancient dragon brought to heel by the Allagans and made to do their bidding. The trials grow ever more arduous, but you are resolved to press on for the sake of the truth."
98,"Your foray into the caverns beneath Castrum Occidens has led you to an unexpected revelation: the incomplete form of Bahamut, harbinger of the Calamity, slumbers deep within earth. Though seemingly a prisoner, the elder primal is gradually being regenerated by the massive, Ragnarok-class internment hulks that surround the unmoving entity. Alisaie reasons that if Bahamut's full restoration is to be prevented, then all three coils sustaining and repairing the dreadful being must be deactivated. Filled with new determination, you assemble a group of courageous comrades and set your sights on the fragment of Dalamud found in the North Shroud."
99,"After battling your way through to the base of the colossal fragment that impales the ground in Alder Springs, your party enters the structure through an opening in its outer shell. The sight that greets you is of an endless procession of azure-lit passages, within which can be glimpsed the grotesque silhouettes of chimerical monstrosities."
100,"Your party activates the coil's lift-like mechanism, and, at a depth of 3,256 yalms, arrives within the interior of the internment hulk proper. The great cavern where the elder primal Bahamut dreams is yet many thousands of yalms distant. Explore the labyrinthine passages of the Ragnarok-class starship, and secure a route into the lowest levels of the hulk."
101,"At a depth of 6,329 yalms, your exhausted yet determined fellowship enters the hulk's operations deck. An impossible scene unfolds before you, the surreal landscape bathed in a crimson glare and holding the promise of epic conflict..."
102,"Having secured a path through the Labyrinth of the Ancients, the fellowship of NOAH finds itself before the entrance to the Crystal Tower proper. With the aid of their new comrades, Unei and Doga, the companions succeed in opening the gate whose workings had baffled even the brightest minds among them. Upon learning that dark forces have awakened within, the fellowship decides to suspend its investigative effort in favor of sealing off the tower. You must fight your way to the apex and defeat the resurrected Emperor Xande, that Eorzea might be free of his all-consuming ambition."
103,"Your foray into the caverns beneath Castrum Occidens has led you to an unexpected revelation: the incomplete form of Bahamut, harbinger of the Calamity, slumbers deep within earth.

Explore the labyrinthine passages of the Ragnarok-class starship, and secure a route into the lowest levels of the hulk."
106,"At a depth of 6,329 yalms, your exhausted yet determined fellowship enters the hulk's operations deck. An impossible scene unfolds before you, the surreal landscape bathed in a crimson glare and holding the promise of epic conflict..."
107,"Alisaie is resolved to go through with her quest to vanquish Bahamut, though it means confronting her beloved grandfather, whom the elder primal has made his thrall. With Alphinaud's cooperation, an aetherial pathway has been established which will take your party to one of the two internment hulks that remain to be disabled. Your foray begins in northern Thanalan, at the set of Dalamud's talons situated in Raubahn's Push. Spare no preparation and expect fierce resistance."
108,"At the depth of 6,835 yalms, you and your companions are greeted by a breathtaking sight: a colossal replica of Dalamud, believed to be the device which regulates Bahamut's regeneration. The structure swarms with legions of the lesser moon's internal defenses, but through it you must go if you are to reach the main bridge."
109,"At 8,872 yalms below the surface, your party arrives within Bahamut's cavernous regeneration chamber. As Alisaie moves to disable the internment hulk, she finds her way barred by her grandsire, the Archon Louisoix. The man once gave his life that the realm might be spared; if you would honor his legacy, you must now strike him down."
110,"Restored to his senses in defeat, Louisoix uses his final moments to send your party to the main bridge of the final internment hulk, there to banish Bahamut once and for all. Yet though the end of your arduous journey is in sight, doubt not but that the cornered primal will lash out with his unbridled rage. If you are to overcome this terrible foe, you and yours must be of one purpose. Join now your hearts and minds, and sally forth to bring the Seventh Umbral Era to its true conclusion─for the future of Eorzea!"
111,"In the twilight of his reign, the first and last emperor of Allag, Xande, desired power above all else. He turned to the terrible being known as the Cloud of Darkness, a ruler of the void, and asked of her strength to make the world kneel before his throne with a covenant of blood.

When Xande was slain, his ambitions were laid to rest alongside him. Yet the Cloud of Darkness still seeks to enter the material realm, and will soon find passage through the voidgate set to manifest within Syrcus Tower. With the fiend's coming, can the fellowship of NOAH brave the void and rescue the three souls able to stem the Cloud's flood of shadows, or will the expedition itself vanish beyond the rift in the World of Darkness?"
112,"Since the Sharlayan exodus, a structure has stood steady against the flow of the Thaliak River. Now, the Illuminati have summoned a primal around this rusting ruin─a terrible colossus of steam and metal. Steel screamed against steel when it rose from the waters, and it drank deep of the land's aether before grinding again to a halt.

The voices of Idyllshire cry out, asking for aid ere their homes are crushed under the weight of iron. You must lead a band of valiant adventurers into the machina and discover how to destroy the core─lest the giant screeches again to life, and bleeds all the realm dry."
113,"In your last foray into the giant's mighty arm, you narrowly escaped Quickthinx Allthoughts and the Illuminati with your life. Yet in so doing, you won a cryptic name─Alexander. Whatever this may be, your path leads into the gloom of Gordias. March onwards with courage, for it is only in the darkness that you can learn how to stop the iron colossus."
114,"In the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis> are writ the designs for a walking citadel. It was known as Alexander, a self-sufficient bastion for logic and reason and a beacon of knowledge for a world adrift─so says the treasure hunter Mide. The Illuminati dreamed this century-old dream, and in so doing gave form to their primal. Yet no matter how beautiful an ideal, the reality of fanatics with such power is a tarnished, ugly thing. By your hand must this threat be stopped."
115,"The Illuminati would see the lofty ideals of the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis> turned into warped elitism, and have their primal play host to their chosen few. From within its walls, they would control the world with cold logic, and crush opposition with a fist of iron. With your eyes opened to the goblin scholars' true ambitions, you must make your way farther past the pumping pistons and grinding gears of the colossus. Can you and your comrades destroy the core therein, or will you fall and so allow your foes to wreak ruin across the realm?"
116,"What fun is there in merely restating the facts? Never one to be content with the truth, the wandering minstrel has taken the liberty of retelling the tale of your journey into Alexander with his trademark embellishments.

At the behest of one such band of sky pirates, you have joined an expedition set on boarding the ominous ghost ship of recent rumor. Will you return triumphant with Leofard and his Redbills, arms laden with the spoils of some ancient trove, or will you fall to the perils of the haunted vessel as has every would-be looter before you...?"

127,"While many will remember the Calamity for the destruction it wrought upon the realm of Eorzea, that destruction was not without its blessings─one of those being the uncovering of ancient Allagan ruins hidden underneath the war-scarred Carteneau Flats and heretofore unseen for several Astral Eras. When an attempt by the Grand Companies of Eorzea to determine the control of these ruins, and more importantly the secrets they contain, through peaceful negotiations ended in failure, the city–states instead elected to solve the issue of dominion using a form of civilized warfare dubbed Frontline."

130,"Legend has it that Llymlaen sealed a giant serpent She Herself created within Swallowtail Roam, an island said to drift about the sea so that those with evil intentions might never find it. When Seal Rock was first discovered, many believed it to be the selfsame island─but its true nature remained unknown until the Calamity laid her secrets bare. Upon their return to the island following the fall of Dalamud, Allied forces discovered Allagan tomeliths containing a wealth of knowledge. They concluded that the entire island was in fact an Allagan construct─a proving ground for Omega and other technology they developed to combat the primal threat. As was the case in Carteneau, control of the island and its resources remain disputed, and peaceful negotiations have failed to achieve a resolution. And so, once more, they would settle the matter on the battlefield."
131,"As airship technology spread throughout Eorzea, pioneers took to the skies to challenge a new frontier. There they came upon a breathtaking sight: a chain of pristine isles clustered about a massive floating crystal─no less a diadem fit for gods. These isles promise untold wealth and danger, and to lay claim to one you must brave the other. Though the deadliest denizens of the Diadem are not wont to emerge in daylight, you would do well to step lightly in this land which time forgot."

134,"Sephirot, the Fiend, was a deity once worshipped by a treelike race native to Meracydia. Brought into being for the sole purpose of repelling the Allagan invasion, Sephirot inflicted ruinous losses upon the imperial army before finally being subdued and imprisoned in the central facility of Azys Lla. And now, millennia later, this immensely powerful entity threatens to awaken, his vengeful dreams disturbed by the careless ambitions of Archbishop Thordan VII. Topple the first pillar of the Warring Triad, or wheresoever his colossal shadow falls shall be visited by unthinkable catastrophe!"
135,"Preserved upon the Allagan tomestone you received from Unukalhai was an extraordinary history─a detailed record of the battles fought between the eikon Sephirot and the armies of Allag. After feeding the account of this epic conflict into Azys Lla's verification systems, you have succeeded in activating what the node describes as a “combat simulation.”

Can the enigmatic technology of the ancient empire truly manifest an enhanced simulacrum of the formidable Fiend? Can this artificial incarnation truly surpass the threat posed by the original Sephirot? There is but one way to know for certain..."
136,"Although you succeeded in destroying the core of Gordias, it seems that was only a temporary measure. The walking fortress has stirred once more, and its left arm now rests on the banks of the Thaliak. The entrance lies open and unguarded, suggesting the goblins inside are as surprised as you. Take advantage of your enemy's unreadiness and face the Illuminati threat once more─hopefully for the last time."
137,"Upon returning from Midas, you learn that Mide surrendered the precious fragment of the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis> to the Illuminati, and that she was in fact a surviving member of a group of Au Ra that failed to summon Alexander three years ago. Although there is certainly more to the apparent treachery than meets the eye, there is no time for doubt. Your offensive against the Illuminati must continue!"
138,"You press further into the depths of the primal, and return to be greeted by Mide, who confesses that while the story of her past is true, the “fragment” she handed over to the Illuminati was nothing more than a useless rock. Not all is well, however, as Wedge informs you of Roundrox's capture by the Illuminati. Your objective is now clear─press further into Midas, and rescue the innocent goblin from her captors!"
139,"You have delved into the deepest parts of Midas, and its power source lies but a short distance ahead. For the sake of Idyllshire, and Roundrox, you must disable the core before Alexander awakes to wreak havoc on the realm. Your allies stand at the ready─steel yourself to break through the Illuminati's last line of defense."
140,"Following the defeat of Diabolos, the unnatural pall choking the crumbling city of Amdapor was lifted, and tranquility restored to the Twelveswood. Or so it had seemed. When the Hearers entered the ruins, however, they had scarce begun consigning the stones to the forest when their elemental allies fled in a sudden panic. By the spirits' agitated whispers did the Seedseers learn that a daunting and hostile presence yet lingered within Amdapor's moldering walls.

The dragons named it “Sohr Khai,” a grieving apology for their failure to avert her fate, and they watched with infinite sadness as Ratatoskr's empty roost was overrun by bird and beast.

Aided by the knowledge contained therein, he raised the very earth unto the heavens, and from this lofty perch did the White Raven nearly orchestrate the destruction of Eorzea.

The remnants of that mad plan still litter the frozen lowlands, as well as other ancient artifacts now laid bare. Though the powers that be are in agreement that Nael's data must be secured, they remain divided on the subject of how best to administer the region, which has prompted them to invoke the same laws which transformed Carteneau and Seal Rock into a battlefield.

262,"Upon the western coast of Hingashi, caressed by the Ruby Sea, there lies the city of Kugane, the nation's sole open port. Dominating the vibrant cityscape is the majestic Kugane Castle, within whose halls a performance was unfolding, a spectacle to entertain visiting dignitaries. But comedy quickly turned to tragedy when a band of lawless shinobi stormed the castle. Ardently opposed to the influence of foreign nations, these interlopers took all present captive, the lord bugyo of Kugane included. The country now sits on a knife's edge, leaning perilously toward an international incident. Who will see that it falls to the other side?"
263,"Upon witnessing her daughter's death at the hands of Fordola and her Skulls, the Qalyana broodmother cried out to the heavens in despair...and a primal answered. Sri Lakshmi, patron deity of the Ananta, came forth from the aether, and the imperials were put to flight. Alas, the tale did not end there, for now the Qalyana demand that the Vira come and pay tribute to the goddess. And so it falls to you and your comrades to journey unto the Qalyana stronghold of Djanan Qhat, and put an end to Sri Lakshmi's dream."
264,"In the shadow of Kugane's renowned Mujikoza theater, you recount your clash with Sri Lakshmi to the wandering minstrel. Moved to melancholy by the tragic tale, he forgoes adapting it for the stage, choosing instead to honor the memory of the departed with a verse. So vivid are the words and sorrowful the melody, you cannot help but relive the fateful encounter in your mind's eye..."

With their boundless ingenuity, the goblins of Idyllshire have transformed the place into an expansive training ground. Here, brave adventurers can take control of mighty machines in large-scale war games reminiscent of battles against the Garlean Empire. A furious struggle for territorial supremacy awaits!"
278,"A god born of sorrow and despair. A man who lives only for death. As one they fought the Warrior of Light, and as one they fell. No words could do this titanic encounter justice...unless they come from the wandering minstrel, to whom no event is beyond improvement. As his nimble fingers pluck out the chords, his rich voice carries you to a place above the world, one that is at once familiar and foreign: Shinryu's domain."
279,"Long ago, in the dawn of the Fifth Astral Era, the modest nation of Skalla was founded in the land of Gyr Abania. Over the span of several centuries, its people constructed a grand city of stone at the bottom of a steep-walled ravine, but even this natural defense could not protect Skalla from destruction during a terrible age of war. When the great flood of the Sixth Umbral Calamity later swept across the realm, the hollow ruins of the city were lost to sight, its remnants submerged beneath a raging sea.

Haunting the depths of what is now Loch Seld, Skalla's silent walls lure adventurers into the salt-laden waters with the promise of mysteries unsolved and treasures unclaimed."
280,"There once were brave souls who uncovered the truth of the Seventh Umbral Calamity. Such trials as they overcame were not to be recorded in history, but far from fading with the passage of time, they have been imagined in vivid detail by the wandering minstrel.

Yet while of Garlean design, the vessel distinctly lacked the bleak outfitting common in the Empire's warmachina. No, this was the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>, private stage for the Majestic Imperial Theater Company─a troupe having won acclaim across Garlemald for their timeless work, <Emphasis>The Zodiac Brave Story</Emphasis>.

Fortuitously, one appears to have presented itself: an anonymous missive from an individual seeking the aid of the warrior who laid low the Lord of the Revel. But before they will divulge the details, they would put your abilities to the proof.

And while its facilities have remained dormant since a recent endeavor to salvage materials, Garlond Ironworks has detected a peculiar energy signature emanating from within.

Had you not just won a battle against a spectral train, you might think the idea of a haunted painting absurd. Thankful for the inventive genius of your companions, you go forth armed with the Chocobo Brush─a tool specifically designed to help you overcome this bizarre encounter."
288,"Known simply as the “Guardian,” this foe is described by Cid as the machine responsible for defending a capital city. As a creation of otherworldly engineering it is impossible to know exactly what weapons it will bring to bear─only that this will be a contest of force versus overwhelming brute force."

Analysis of his data reveals that, despite his comical appearance, this cackling jester once rose to godhood and cast his entire planet into ruin. His is a power not to be underestimated. Nero has also alerted you to the villain's propensity for trickery, and promised to watch for deadly feints through his enhanced monitor. You can only hope that his warnings come in time..."

Byakko of the Four Lords is on the verge of being consumed by his aramitama, and should this come to pass, he will forever be no more than a feral beast. And so it falls to you and yours to face the legendary auspice in battle─to quell the madness within and save his soul!"
291,"A devoted student of the fine arts, the wandering minstrel has recently begun studying a form of classical Hingan poetry. Duly inspired by your account of the battle for Byakko's soul, he tries his hand at one such “tanka”, seeking to capture the essence of who the auspice truly is. Even absent music, his words nevertheless have a hypnotic feeling, and you find it rather easy to recall the encounter, albeit in a more dramatic fashion..."

The first king of the new kingdom was not only a military genius, but also the founder of geomancy, and so after his death this royal mausoleum became a holy place to which his disciples would make pilgrimage. Alas, following the imperial invasion, it was abandoned and fell into disrepair, and none can say for certain what dangers lie within. Regardless, if Soroban's rigorous training under Genbu is to continue, you and your comrades must venture into these hallowed halls and obtain the tamate-bako of geomancy, an ancient relic with the power to manipulate time itself..."

Or were the seeds of villainy always there, their growth merely hastened by circumstance? These questions bring to mind Tsukuyomi's overwhelming malice, your memories now suffused by the tragedy of the minstrel's verse..."

His rendition of your triumph over the Ultima Weapon takes the threads of history and weaves them into an epic tapestry.

But while the white tiger, Byakko, has been restored to his senses, the radiant Suzaku is on the verge of succumbing to the aramitama. For centuries she has mourned the fallen Tenzen, and in her boundless grief struggled to accept his loss. What is more, her ascendant aramitama now clouds her mind and drives her to reject those who would offer her comfort.

With the advent of the Flood, however, you have reason to believe something more sinister now resides there as well."

Rather than seeking to end this threat once and for all, Ryne hopes to use its limitless power to restore the aetherial balance of the Empty and breathe life into the planet.
