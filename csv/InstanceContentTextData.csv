10700,"So for this exercise, ye'll be learnin' about “enmity” an' how to build it."

10702,"The best way to establish yerself as a threat?

10715,"When it comes to yer place in a party, yer the wall o' steel what takes the enemy hits."
10716,"Soakin' up the pain, an' keepin' yer mates safe─that's what ye need to focus on most durin' battle."
10717,"The best way to establish yerself as a threat?
String together some nasty combinations!"
10718,"The best way to establish yerself as a threat?

11108,"Adjust yer position so that ye hit all yer foes with <Sheet(Action,3621,0)/>!"
11109,"Once ye've got the situation under control, ye can start usin' combinations!"
11110,"Defeat every enemy on the field, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."
11200,"For this exercise, ye'll learn to deal with reinforcements."
11201,"Sometimes there're latecomers to a battle, so ye've got to stay alert."
11202,"If ye notice a new foe arrive, don't give in to panic! Keep calm, an' pick the enemy up with yer usual tools!"
11203,"Yer ally is takin' a beatin'!
Do what it takes to make the enemy notice ye!"
11204,"Defeat the enemy while staying alert for reinforcements!"
11205,"The axeman will call for aid at certain points in the battle! Prioritize takin' down the reinforcements!"
11206,"Move yerself─and the fight─some distance away! Ye don't want yer ally gettin' hit by them big swings!"
11207,"There's a new enemy on the field!
Use <Sheet(Action,24,0)/> if ye have to!"
11208,"Nice work! Now take down that newcomer!"
11209,"Are they too far away for a combination?
Then reel 'em in with a Shield Lob!"
11210,"Are they too far away for a combination?
Then reel 'em in with a Tomahawk!"
11211,"Are they too far away for a combination?
Then reel 'em in with an Unmend!"
11212,"Once ye've got everyone nice an' close, ye can switch to <Sheet(Action,7381,0)/> to keep that enmity flowin'!"
11213,"Once ye've got everyone nice an' close, ye can switch to <Sheet(Action,41,0)/> to keep that enmity flowin'!"
11214,"Once ye've got everyone nice an' close, ye can switch to <Sheet(Action,3621,0)/> to keep that enmity flowin'!"
11215,"There's a new enemy on the field!
Use <Sheet(Action,46,0)/> if ye have to!"
11216,"There's a new enemy on the field!
Use <Sheet(Action,3624,0)/> if ye have to!"
11217,"Defeat every enemy on the field, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."
11300,"As you might have guessed, the purpose of this exercise is to teach cooperation."
11301,"Your ally will hold the enemy's attention─it is your job to take the foe down!"
11302,"味方と協力して、敵を討伐できれば訓練合格だよ！"
11303,"Defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
11304,"Attack the same foe as your ally to win the battle!"
11305,"That's the way, novice! I'll keep him occupied─you concentrate on bringing him down!"
11306,"Very good!
Now here's a hint about enemy facing!"
11307,"Your opponent will have a harder time avoiding blows from the flanks or from behind."
11308,"There are also certain techniques that perform better when executed from such positions."
11309,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the sharp end of the spear."
11310,"Simply put, your role is to inflict as much damage as possible, while keeping your own skin intact."
11311,"As such, you cannot just attack whichever enemy you please!"
11312,"If you strike a foe other than one controlled by your ally, then you risk becoming the target of deadly aggression."
11313,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11400,"For this exercise, you will be fighting multiple opponents!"
11401,"The key to victory is coordination with your comrades─each foe will fall all the swifter under a focused assault!"
11402,"Pay attention, novice!
Target the enemy engaged by your ally!"
11403,"Coordinate with your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11404,"Mark well the opponent your ally has engaged, and attack the same enemy!"
11405,"Start the fight with the staff waver─such foes are often the most dangerous, but the least robust."
11406,"Be sure to attack the same enemy as your ally! Strike the wrong foe five times and you fail this exercise!"
11407,"That's the way, novice! Once this one's down, we'll move on to the fistfighter!"
11408,"There's another yet standing!
Don't lose your focus!"
11409,"He's almost done for!
Grind him into the dust!"
11410,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11500,"Do you remember the lesson where I had you evading enemy attacks?"
11501,"This exercise will put that training to the test. You must needs plan your strikes around some fancy footwork!"
11502,"You must pay attention! Watch for the signs whilst you press the attack!"
11503,"Engage the axe wielder, but keep an eye out for counterattacks!"
11504,"Defeat the enemy while avoiding attacks!"
11505,"If you allow yourself to be hit five times, we will start this exercise again from the beginning!"
11506,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
11507,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
11508,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
11509,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11600,"This exercise will teach you how to deal with enemy reinforcements."
11601,"As the battle progresses, new foes will appear on the field."
11602,"These sudden arrivals will target your weakest comrade, so you must be quick to eliminate them!"
11603,"Your healer is under attack!
Swiftly now! Eliminate the aggressor! "
11604,"Another enemy has arrived on the field!
Engage this new foe!"
11605,"Keep an eye peeled for reinforcements, novice!"
11606,"Defeat the enemy while staying alert for reinforcements!"
11607,"Excellent!
You handled the situation perfectly!"
11608,"Here comes another!
Make short work of this skirmisher!"
11609,"Very good! Now see the battle to its end!"
11610,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11700,"In this exercise, you will learn to manipulate the battlefield."
11701,"During the battle, enemies will pour forth from the rear gate. New foes will continue to flood in whilst this portal remains open."
11702,"You must operate the lever that closes the gate, or your party will be overwhelmed!"
11703,"The reinforcements are without end!
Quickly─use the lever to close the gate!"
11704,"Manipulate the battlefield and defeat the enemy!"
11705,"Engage the enemy, but be wary of the gate!"
11706,"The gate has opened! Ignore the reinforcements for now, and operate the lever!"
11707,"Well done! The flood of enemies has ceased! Now mop up the foes remaining!"
11708,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11800,"Now that you understand what is expected of you, we can continue with the lesson."
11801,"The upcoming exercise requires that you keep your ally healed."
11802,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the soothing wind of restoration."
11803,"When you've healed all there is to heal, there may be time to weave in some offensive magicks."
11804,"Heal your ally and defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
11805,"Your primary concern should be healing your ally!"
11806,"But keep an eye on your companion!
You should not be blasting if someone is bleeding!"
11807,"As such, rather than engaging the enemy directly, your primary role is to focus upon the mending of wounds."
11808,"With the support of your diligent healing, your party will prevail against even the most savage of foes! "
11809,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
11900,"In this next exercise, you will be healing multiple allies."
11901,"You will need to stay alert, and switch your attention between allies as the situation demands."
11902,"体力の少ない味方がいます！　急いで回復を！"
11903,"There's a new enemy on the field! You'll need to keep an eye on the health of both allies!"
11904,"Maintain the health of your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11905,"Focus your attention on the well-being of your companions!"
11906,"Another enemy threatens your party! You might try attacking this foe if your allies are uninjured."
11907,"Battle is chaotic, and you must needs learn flexibility."
11908,"Thus, you will find yourself in a scenario in which sudden reinforcements threaten your party."
11909,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
12000,"For this exercise, you will learn to heal whilst avoiding harm."
12001,"As before, you must watch for signs you are being attacked. Move swiftly, and time your casts to avoid interruption."
12002,"If you are hit five times, we shall start again from the beginning!"
12003,"Pay attention, now!
Dead healers cast no cures!"
12004,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
12005,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
12006,"Stand clear of your companions! An attack that targets you need not threaten them as well!"
12007,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
12008,"Defeat the enemy while healing allies and avoiding attacks!"
12009,"Avoid enemy attacks, and heal your allies!"
12010,"Success will be a matter of combining lessons already learned!"
12011,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
12100,"This is it! The final exercise!"
12101,"As the culmination of yer trainin', all the skills ye've learned'll be put to the test!"
12102,"You've arrived at the mountain's peak─the final exercise!"
12103,"As the culmination of your training, all the skills you've acquired will be put to the test!"
12104,"And now we come to the final exercise..."
12105,"As the culmination of your training, all the skills you've acquired will be put to the test."
12106,"Right, let's start with the basics! Keep the foe away from yer allies, an' watch yer positionin'!"
12107,"Let's begin with the basics, shall we? Pay attention to the enemy's facing, and stay out of harm's way!"
12108,"As always, healing is your primary concern!
Attack only when it is safe to do so!"
12109,"Ye've got more company!
Establish yerself as the biggest threat!"
12110,"Watch out for the jackal!
Put it down quickly!"
12111,"Watch out for the jackal!
Be sure your ally does not fall to its jaws!"
12112,"More reinforcements!
Take control o' the field! Show 'em who's in charge!"
12113,"Another jackal!
Spare your healer its jaws!"
12114,"Another jackal!
Keep an eye on your lightly armored companion!"
12115,"Ye've handled groups in yer previous trainin'! This's no different!"
12116,"Now you face multiple foes! Remember to coordinate efforts with your allies!"
12117,"Now the battle becomes interesting...
You'll need to watch your positioning here."
12118,"Defeat the tamed dodo"
12119,"Defeat the tamed jackals"
12120,"Defeat the tamed puks"
12121,"Defeat the tamed goobbue"
12122,"Yer near the end of it now, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>, but stay focused! This bloke's a bit of a handful..."
12123,"And now for the last challenge!
This one hits hard, so be quick on your feet!"
12124,"Your last opponent looms!
This one packs a wallop, so stay on your toes!"
12125,"Just one more push! Victory is yers for the takin'!"
12126,"Just a little more, novice!
Keep your focus, and see this foe defeated!"
12127,"The end is in sight!
Be sure your allies survive the battle!"
12128,"Breathe deep, remember yer lessons, an' ye'll do fine! Let me know when yer ready to begin."
12129,"Put your lessons into practice and you'll do just fine! Say the word when you are ready to begin."
12130,"Put your lessons into practice and you'll do just fine! We can begin as soon as you are ready."
12200,"Listen up, novice!"
12201,"Are we clear?
Let me know when yer ready to begin."
12202,"This trainin' exercise is now underway!"
12203,"...Ye've failed this one, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Let's chalk it up to experience, an' try again, eh?"
12204,"...I'm callin' an end to this exercise. Let's chalk it up to experience, an' try again, eh?"
12205,"An' this concludes the exercise!
Come see me for yer reward."
12206,"That's the way!"
12207,"Defeat every enemy on the field, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."
12208,"Let us proceed directly to the briefing."
12209,"Everything is clear, I trust? Say the word when you are ready to begin."
12210,"This training exercise is now underway!"
12211,"I'm afraid you've failed this one, novice...
But, chin up! Practice makes perfect!"
12212,"I'm afraid I must call an end to this exercise...
But, chin up! Practice makes perfect!"
12213,"Bravo! And thus concludes the exercise.
Pray come and receive your reward."
12214,"You're doing splendidly! Keep it up!"
12215,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
12216,"Do I have your full attention?
Then let us proceed."
12217,"Any questions?
We can begin as soon as you are ready."

But you begin again knowing what to expect!"

24376,"Here we are. The Principia. Inside is the transmission tower."
24377,"What in the seven hells are these!?"
24378,"Curious that we could defeat these but not the soldiers earlier. Perhaps because they are not truly part of this memory?"

24916,"Not the best weather to be navigatin' the Cieldalaes, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the fish, I always say!"
24917,"Ah, taste the spray from the Bloodbrine Sea! This water's saltier than my old granddad and teemin' with fish for the takin'!"
24918,"The Bloodbrine's downright murderous today! Have a care when you haul in your catch, or the crimson in the swells might well be yours!"
24919,"Ohhh, we're sailin' round in Rothlyt Sound, with rod in hand and hearts unbound!♪
Right, enough singin'─time for fishin'!"
24920,"Ohhh, the seas are wroth in Rothlyt Sound─hold fast now, mates, or we'll be drowned!♪
Perfect conditions for hookin' a monster, I reckon!"

25204,"Let's begin the G-Warrior training simulation. I've prepared three trials to teach you the basics."
25205,"First, I want you to try attacking the guidance system. Don't worry, it won't fight back!"
25206,"The G-Warrior is armed with a range of weaponry. Now's your chance to learn what it's capable of."
25207,"So far, so good. Let's move on to something a bit more advanced, shall we?"
25208,"If you feel you've already learned enough, you can end the simulation by accessing the training node."
25209,"But once you begin combat, you won't be able to leave the simulation until it's over."
25210,"All right, let's continue."
25211,"The G-Warrior also comes equipped with the Pyretic Booster, which diverts even more power to its weapons and increases its speed and maneuverability."
25212,"This, however, comes at a price. Activating it places a huge strain on the G-Warrior, so it must only be used in short bursts."
25213,"That's why it's best to practice here before heading into battle.
Now, try activating the Pyretic Booster!"
25214,"You'll notice that your movement speed is much improved. But as shown on your monitor, the G-Warrior becomes more and more structurally unstable as time passes."
25215,"To deactivate the Pyretic Booster, press the same button again."
25216,"Now to try using the Pyretic Booster to destroy the target."
25217,"This time, the node will launch wide reaching attacks in quick succession. But with your increased movement speed, you should have no trouble evading them."
25218,"Excellent work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You'd best deactivate the Pyretic Booster while I explain the final trial."
25219,"Are you listening? Quickly, deactivate the Pyretic Booster!
Even though it's only a simulation, it'll terminate prematurely if you're not careful."
25220,"We've covered offense, now to look at defense. This is where the Aetherial Aegis should come in handy."
25221,"Unfortunately, you can't keep the barrier up indefinitely as it will drain the G-Warrior's power reserves. You might even run out of energy for the weapons, so watch out."
25222,"First, let's try deploying the Aetherial Aegis."
25223,"The monitor shows how much power is being drained. Don't let it get too low!"
25224,"That's enough for now. Turn off the barrier using the same button used to deploy it."
25225,"For the last trial, we'll use the Aetherial Aegis while attempting to destroy the target."
25226,"Unlike before, there is no way to escape its attacks, so you'll need to weather them using the barrier."
25227,"You're a natural! All right, that's everything. Time to end the simulation."
25228,"You'll need to deactivate the Aetherial Aegis before you run out of power!"

25623,"Hmm? What happened to the other half?"

25705,"And I believe I have the perfect subjects."
25706,"Let not their appearance stay your hand. Beneath the facade, they are merely monsters."

25714,"But enough talk. It is not your assertions that I wish to know, but your strength."
25715,"Falsely accused of regicide, you fled for the snow-swept fields of Coerthas."
25716,"Had you and the Scions met your demise that day in the sultanate, Lahabrea might have been spared his."
25717,"But not only did you stubbornly live; you hurled yourself into the thick of the Dragonsong War."
25718,"Swept along by the tide of events, you pursued and slew those who sought to stop the unending conflict. Just as you were bid."
25719,"...Or was it a thirst for vengeance that drove you?"
25720,"I trust you are beginning to limber up. Do keep up the fine form."
25721,"Around heroes, people are wont to flock. People who harbor all manner of motives, each baser than the last."
25722,"Come, let the curtains rise on the grand melee."

25725,"There is no saving your comrade this time. All you can do is cut off the serpent's head."
25726,"And as simple as that, a thousand-year war is brought to its conclusion."
25727,"But every end marks a new beginning. And for heroes such as you, there is only ever conflict."
25728,"Emperor Solus had kindled an insatiable flame. Garlemald was its name, and it raged across the land, consuming all in its path."

25730,"Again you fought, and again you grew stronger. So strong that we could no longer control you."
25731,"Yours is an unnatural, beastly strength. And we shall lay it bare."
25732,"In order to gain a foothold in the liberation effort, you journeyed to Far Eastern plains."
25733,"There you encountered the land's greatest warriors, and sought to win them over to your cause."
25734,"The strong are drawn to the strong. Thus did you gather new allies to your banner."
25735,"Yet where ardent souls gather, so too do fires burn. In this way did you consign those around you to the flames."
25736,"Burn them all, hero. Reduce them to nothingness, like the ephemeral morning dew they are."
25737,"You did not hesitate...or perhaps could not? No matter. Let us turn our attention to the finale."
25738,"Here we shall have a test between fellow beasts. It is only fitting, would you not agree?"
25739,"When I fought you in this flesh, 'twas I who triumphed. Will you turn the tables this time?"
