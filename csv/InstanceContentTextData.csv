11306,"Very good!
Now here's a hint about enemy facing!"
11307,"Your opponent will have a harder time avoiding blows from the flanks or from behind."
11308,"There are also certain techniques that perform better when executed from such positions."
11309,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the sharp end of the spear."
11310,"Simply put, your role is to inflict as much damage as possible, while keeping your own skin intact."
11311,"As such, you cannot just attack whichever enemy you please!"
11312,"If you strike a foe other than one controlled by your ally, then you risk becoming the target of deadly aggression."
11313,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11400,"For this exercise, you will be fighting multiple opponents!"
11401,"The key to victory is coordination with your comrades─each foe will fall all the swifter under a focused assault!"
11402,"Pay attention, novice!
Target the enemy engaged by your ally!"
11403,"Coordinate with your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11404,"Mark well the opponent your ally has engaged, and attack the same enemy!"
11405,"Start the fight with the staff waver─such foes are often the most dangerous, but the least robust."
11406,"Be sure to attack the same enemy as your ally! Strike the wrong foe five times and you fail this exercise!"
11407,"That's the way, novice! Once this one's down, we'll move on to the fistfighter!"
11408,"There's another yet standing!
Don't lose your focus!"
11409,"He's almost done for!
Grind him into the dust!"
11410,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11500,"Do you remember the lesson where I had you evading enemy attacks?"
11501,"This exercise will put that training to the test. You must needs plan your strikes around some fancy footwork!"
11502,"You must pay attention! Watch for the signs whilst you press the attack!"
11503,"Engage the axe wielder, but keep an eye out for counterattacks!"
11504,"Defeat the enemy while avoiding attacks!"
11505,"If you allow yourself to be hit five times, we will start this exercise again from the beginning!"
11506,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
11507,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
11508,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
11509,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11600,"This exercise will teach you how to deal with enemy reinforcements."
11601,"As the battle progresses, new foes will appear on the field."
11602,"These sudden arrivals will target your weakest comrade, so you must be quick to eliminate them!"
11603,"Your healer is under attack!
Swiftly now! Eliminate the aggressor! "
11604,"Another enemy has arrived on the field!
Engage this new foe!"
11605,"Keep an eye peeled for reinforcements, novice!"
11606,"Defeat the enemy while staying alert for reinforcements!"
11607,"Excellent!
You handled the situation perfectly!"
11608,"Here comes another!
Make short work of this skirmisher!"
11609,"Very good! Now see the battle to its end!"
11610,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11700,"In this exercise, you will learn to manipulate the battlefield."
11701,"During the battle, enemies will pour forth from the rear gate. New foes will continue to flood in whilst this portal remains open."
11702,"You must operate the lever that closes the gate, or your party will be overwhelmed!"
11703,"The reinforcements are without end!
Quickly─use the lever to close the gate!"
11704,"Manipulate the battlefield and defeat the enemy!"
11705,"Engage the enemy, but be wary of the gate!"
11706,"The gate has opened! Ignore the reinforcements for now, and operate the lever!"
11707,"Well done! The flood of enemies has ceased! Now mop up the foes remaining!"
11708,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11800,"Now that you understand what is expected of you, we can continue with the lesson."
11801,"The upcoming exercise requires that you keep your ally healed."
11802,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the soothing wind of restoration."
11803,"When you've healed all there is to heal, there may be time to weave in some offensive magicks."
11804,"Heal your ally and defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
11805,"Your primary concern should be healing your ally!"
11806,"But keep an eye on your companion!
You should not be blasting if someone is bleeding!"
11807,"As such, rather than engaging the enemy directly, your primary role is to focus upon the mending of wounds."
11808,"With the support of your diligent healing, your party will prevail against even the most savage of foes! "
11809,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
11900,"In this next exercise, you will be healing multiple allies."
11901,"You will need to stay alert, and switch your attention between allies as the situation demands."
11902,"体力の少ない味方がいます！　急いで回復を！"
11903,"There's a new enemy on the field! You'll need to keep an eye on the health of both allies!"
11904,"Maintain the health of your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11905,"Focus your attention on the well-being of your companions!"
11906,"Another enemy threatens your party! You might try attacking this foe if your allies are uninjured."
11907,"Battle is chaotic, and you must needs learn flexibility."
11908,"Thus, you will find yourself in a scenario in which sudden reinforcements threaten your party."
11909,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
12000,"For this exercise, you will learn to heal whilst avoiding harm."
12001,"As before, you must watch for signs you are being attacked. Move swiftly, and time your casts to avoid interruption."
12002,"If you are hit five times, we shall start again from the beginning!"
12003,"Pay attention, now!
Dead healers cast no cures!"
12004,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
12005,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
12006,"Stand clear of your companions! An attack that targets you need not threaten them as well!"
12007,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
12008,"Defeat the enemy while healing allies and avoiding attacks!"
12009,"Avoid enemy attacks, and heal your allies!"

24204,"If you would see theirs set free, answer me these riddles three."
24205,"'Twixt these talismans hide friend and foe. Choose your companions well, or sorrow know."
24206,"A test of mind and memory. Choose wisely, and you all may yet go free."
24207,"Desire you that which I yet claim? Then we shall play another game..."
24208,"Yet still there remains one trial you must pass."
24209,"Deft of paw, with kin do I vie. Though sought apart, betterment of the whole do our efforts descry. What...am...I?"
24210,"With fearsome fang, I travel with pack. Together we find harmony, and thus for peace our land does not lack. What...am...I?"
24211,"On my belly do I crawl. By my strength does prosperity reign within our hall. What...am...I?"
24212,"You trespass, mortal, upon sacred ground.
In retribution, four souls have I bound."
24213,"Leave Trial's Threshold"
24214,"A pathetic display, one and all. The weak shall not be suffered to disgrace this sacred hall."
24215,"Indeed, the opo-opo is keen and shrewd. The spirit of ingenuity, by whose guidance the Ronkans did prosperity pursue. The riddle's answer you did discern, and thus to you a soul returns."
24216,"Indeed, 'twas the spirit of the wolf their doctrines praised. That they would know peace and harmony to the end of their days. The riddle's answer you did discern, and thus to you a soul returns."
24217,"Indeed, the dread serpent turned protector, lured to slumber ere it tear the world asunder. The riddle's answer you did discern, and thus to you a soul returns."
24218,"Alas, 'twas the opo-opo. Keen and shrewd, its spirit exalts ingenuity, a virtue by which the Ronkans did prosperity pursue."
24219,"Alas, 'twas the wolf their doctrines praised. That they might know peace and harmony to the end of their days."
24220,"Alas, 'twas a snake. The dread serpent turned protector, lured to slumber ere it tear the world asunder."
24221,"For this mistake, a single talisman I shall take."
24222,"For this mistake, a single talisman I shall take."
24223,"For this mistake, a single talisman I shall take."
24224,"If you would glean the knowledge enshrined in this earth, I would first take the measure of your worth."
24225,"Solve the riddles of the huaca!"
24226,"Your comrades are assembled, together at last..."
24227,"Finally! This is what I was expecting to find here in the ruins."
24228,"Be careful, sisters!"
24229,"Hold nothing back. Failure of this <Emphasis>test</Emphasis> does not appear to be an option."
24230,"Quickly─fan out before it strikes!"
24231,"Its sights are set on Y'shtola! Hurry, we must protect her!"
24232,"Victory oft begs sacrifice, but which of you would pay the price? "
24233,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Hurry, we have to save <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>!"
24234,"Oh, no─Cymet!"
24235,"Impressive..."
24236,""
24237,"You may think you have won, but we have only just begun!"
24238,"Poison!? <cough> <cough> Come, gather around me."
24239,"Reinforcements? Leave them to me!"
24240,"We mustn't waste time with this slime─focus on the guardian!"
24241,"Show them your all!"
24242,"Well fought, hero, the trial is complete. The way is open, and thus...I concede...defeat..."
24243,"Not wholly unexpected, but an exhausting ordeal nevertheless."
24244,"One worthy of she who the Ronkans extolled, must be strong of mind, body, and soul."
24300,"Make your way to the transmission tower!"
24301,"Speak with Cid!"
24302,"Defeat the imperial soldiers!"
24303,"Defeat the antibodies!"
24304,"Defeat Bahamut!"
24305,"This is Bozja Citadel, alright. At least...I think it is. Was everything so distorted when you tested this before?"
24306,"Your recollection of this place appears grossly incomplete. I can but assume your memory is being warped by your subconscious."
24307,"Well I'd rather not stand around laboring over details. Let's look for the transmission tower in the Principia. Anything of import would've been stored there."
24308,"You've done it, Cid! The road has returned."
24309,"We should be able to reach the Principia if we keep heading north."
24310,"Look! There's the transmission tower!"
24311,"The tension in the air is palpable."
24312,"Ah, right. The soldiers were on high alert that day."
24313,"The Bozjan Resistance had infiltrated the citadel to stop the Academy's experiments."
24314,"A curious question. One I believe worth investigating. Shall we?"
24315,"The memory appears to be...mending itself? Interesting."
24316,"Could they be a manifestation of your subconscious? If so, they likely seek to suppress your memories of the citadel."
24317,"Meaning they intend to purge us from your mind. We cannot let them!"
24318,"Is there no end to them? We have to hold on, lest they succeed in erasing us from Cid's mind."
24319,"Are we sure I'm not suffering from a sudden onset of psychosis?"
24320,"Just a little further..."
24321,"Is that...Cid? Do you recall this happening?"
24322,"Father, please! If you would just look over this data─"
24323,"Enough, damn you! The next time you question me it shall be the last. Now leave!"
24324,"You of all people should understand the risks. Why do you refuse to see reason?"
24325,"It's rather unlike him to overlook data, no matter the source."
24326,"Look here. You─er, I mean... He left behind his research documentation."
24327,"There they are! The replicas of Gunnhildr's blades!"
24328,"Bahamut!? This has to be another attempt by your subconscious to stop us. Please, Cid, you have to pull yourself together."
24329,"Careful. I like not the looks of this..."
24330,"Oh no! Could his psyche be deteriorating? <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, look out!"
24331,"We have to hold on! For Cid!"
24332,"Thank you. I... I feel better, now."
24333,"Perhaps now your subconscious will be more forthcoming with the truth in this memory."
24334,"The Meteor project cannot be stopped! I will not allow it!"
24335,"Taste my steel!"
24336,"Careful of his blade!"
24337,"Your struggles shall avail you not!"
24338,"Keep your distance!"
24339,"You would dash yourself against my shield? Very well..."
24340,"I will mount your heads upon my wall!"
24341,"He would turn the very air against us. Have care, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
24342,"Ready the turrets!"
24343,"うるさい機械を、先に壊すわよ！"
24344,"I tire of these games!"
24345,"You dare defy me!?"
24346,"I thought to offer you a quick, painless death. Alas..."
24347,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. A little help, if you'd be so kind."
24348,"I can take the brunt of it, but I'll need a little help!"
24349,"By thy leave!"
24350,"Now! Drive it back!"
24351,"Hold on just a little longer!"
24352,"リーン、今だ！
力を解き放てッ……！"
24353,"Minfilia... Give me strength!"
24354,"I shall not yield!"
24355,"That my defenses could be broken..."
24356,"It is time I bring my full strength to bear!"
24357,"All of our research, our planning... It cannot be for naught!"
24358,"The Empire cannot...must...not..."
24359,"Leave this to me."
24360,"Quickly! My barrier shan't hold long!"
24361,"We've come too far to fail now!"
24362,"Come on, we can't give up!"
24363,"Hold on, Thancred!"
24364,"We're so close!"
24365,"We've no choice but to fight. Otherwise, his subconscious will continue to repress this memory."
24366,"What in the world? The road, it just...ends."
24367,"A consequence of your incomplete memories. You have to think back, Cid. Where did this road lead?"
24368,"Damn it all, the road is cut off again. Come on, Cid, you have to remember."
24369,"A psychological stimulus to prompt recollection... Yes, that just might work."
24370,"Well done, Cid. Let us press onward."
24371,"Search for clues to help Cid's memory."
24372,"Speak with Cid."
24373,"Did you see that? A military base appeared out of thin air... Or out of my mind, I suppose."
24374,"Do you suppose it's possible we can tamper with this memory?"
24375,"Altering memories is easier said than done, it seems. Well, let's keep going."
24376,"Here we are. The Principia. Inside is the transmission tower."
24377,"What in the seven hells are these!?"
24378,"Curious that we could defeat these but not the soldiers earlier. Perhaps because they are not truly part of this memory?"
24379,"We can worry about that later. Come on, we're nearly to the tower."
24380,"Gah! I... I can't...move."
24381,"It seems to be having an adverse effect on Cid's psyche. Quickly, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, we have to stop it!"
24382,"Piteous worms! There will be naught left of you but ash!"
24383,"I shall not yield!"
24384,"That my defenses could be bested..."
24385,"It is time I bring my full strength to bear!"
24386,"I'll hold his attention. Cover me."
24387,"By the gods, this data... The Empire would invite a calamity."
24388,"So many sleepless nights spent on those damned papers. All for nothing..."
24389,"If my suspicions are correct, then he was already... Ahem. Never mind, let us press on. The truth awaits us."
24390,"Review Cid's research!"
24391,"Defeat Varis yae Galvus!"

24401,"Thou wouldst forge this world anew?
I, Ramuh, shall test thy worth."
24402,"Spears of lightning, to me!"

24404,"From the storm of my judgment, thou shalt not escape!"

24406,"The rolling of thunder foretells thy doom, mortal."
24407,"By the fourteen bolts be thee rent asunder!"

24413,"With all my might, I smite thee!"
24414,"With renewed vigor, mine arbiters enter the fray!"
24415,"O noble beasts of the levin, may none withstand your charge!"
24416,"I have taken thy measure, Bringer of Light."
24417,"Over and over doth lightning strike thee!"
24418,"Each bolt is mine to command!"
24419,"Thy bravery is commendable, though it shall avail thee naught..."
24420,"Arbiters! With me!"

24509,"Gwooooooh!"

Right, enough singin'─time for fishin'!"

Perfect conditions for hookin' a monster, I reckon!"

I wonder if more of their mates'll be joinin' them..."

Could be they're scoutin' ahead for the rest of the pod."

Makes you wonder what drew 'em near, eh?"
24936,"Keep an eye out. If the seagulls are flockin', it's a good idea to get your hook in the water."

24941,"Ah, you hear that whistlin' in the breeze? That means we're in the Sirensong Sea, and its bounty is yours for the takin'!"
24942,"Every siren in the sea is wailin' now! Will you go home with a barrel full o' fish, or will another soul be taken by their stormy song?"
24943,"Feast your eyes on Kugane, more dazzlin' than the Ruby Sea herself! The fish in these parts grow fatter than a merchant's coinpurse, so have your best bait at the ready!"
24944,"Kugane's no less a sight to behold, even under inhospitable skies! Keep one hand tight on your rod and the other firm on the bulwark!"
24945,"Behold the glitterin' expanse of the Ruby Sea! Each fish a jewel worthy of adornin' the end of your line!"
24946,"Looks like rough waters in the Ruby Sea! But if a tumbled jewel comes out prettier, then a tumbled fish... Well, I reckon we'll find out soon enough!"
24947,"Here were are─the One River! You'll have your pick of the meatiest fish in Othard, assumin' you have what it takes to wrest them from the waters! "
24948,"Seems the weather in the One River is less than welcomin'! But you wouldn't be here if you didn't have a steady hand and a sharp eye, so I know you'll pluck a prize from these troubled waters!"

25223,"The monitor shows how much power is being drained. Don't let it get too low!"
25224,"That's enough for now. Turn off the barrier using the same button used to deploy it."
25225,"For the last trial, we'll use the Aetherial Aegis while attempting to destroy the target."

Is adventuring always this disgusting!?"
34022,"I should rather not traverse a fungal bridge, but I suppose if we hurry across..."
34023,"The decay is especially bad in this section. I fear the fungal growth is all which keeps it from collapsing."
34024,"Gah! You see!? Even the water is some ghastly shade of...wait. Is that ceruleum?"
34025,"If you can best a hecatoncheir so handily, then it certainly bodes well for the remainder of our expedition!"
34026,"To think that such a cavernous hollow yawns directly beneath Ul'dah!"
34027,"Raising one of these lifts should provide us passage across. Assuming, of course, that the winch yet functions..."
34028,"Interesting. The lift appears of Ul'dahn design, albeit an old one, but everything else screams “Amalj'aa.”"
34029,"Yes, most definitely Amalj'aa construction. Fortifications built for war, rather than habitation, I would say."
34030,"Could this camp be from the time of the zombie purge? Was Father hoping I would see this one day...?"
34031,"Did <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> know that Ul'dahn and Amalj'aa once fought side by side? 'Tis not common knowledge."

Do you see any handy levers or the like...?"

Yet another facet of the palace defenses?"

34090,"Hm. Was it to make this discovery that Father left me the key? I can but wonder..."

Come along─nothing ventured, nothing gained."

I suspect this chamber was a dead end for cornering thieves."

34128,"Ah...
An Amalj'aa coffin, if I am not mistaken."

Would more water flush out the mud, I wonder?"

36376,"Under the auspices of two auspices, as it were. Curious."
36377,"So the glass serves as a magicked doorknob of sorts? The monks were certainly inventive..."

36379,""
36380,"I might have known that Suzaku and Seiryu were the guardians of this gateway─though in fairness, one usually needs grapple with only one at a time. "
36381,"...Would that we had arrived sooner. Judging by her supernatural size, the demons have already taken that poor shinobi."
36382,"She must be in the thrall of a treasure. A promising lead...though at an unfortunate cost."
36383,"I see no clockwork mechanisms... We've an honest-to-kami mononoke on our hands."
36384,"The bloodlust is palpable... Have care, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I shall be right here─at a reasonably safe distance─cheering you on!"
36385,"Excellent work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I knew from the first you would emerge victori─"
36386,"...What, pray tell, is that look for?"
36387,"Your faith in my faith in you aside, you may be interested to know that I recognize the detailing on this armor. It once belonged to a renowned warrior. "
36388,"Would that my falcon had the freight capacity of a barge..."
36389,"Alas, I suppose I must choose which artifacts to leave behind─for now."
36390,"Well done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Even the fiercest mononoke is no match for you!"
36391,"'Tis difficult to appreciate while under threat of slicing and dicing, but the monks amassed a truly impressive collection of blades here."
36392,"To say naught of our most enspirited armor!"
36393,"Perhaps the soul of the warrior who once wore it yet lingered, awaiting his chance to take to the battlefield once more..."
36394,"Or perhaps his sword was a treasure with a life of its own."
36395,"A vexing conundrum─what to bring back to Kugane, that is. I don't suppose you've space in your bag...?"
36396,"Well done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You are an unholy terror on the battlefield─and I mean that in the most flattering way."
36397,"To think that our secret passage would lead us to such an immaculate armory... Perhaps the monks utilized this as a shelter in times of strife."
36398,"I doubt they expected the armor they stored to come to life, however. Quite the harrowing foe, that one."
36399,"...Which leads me to believe that the armor itself must be one of the treasures we seek!"
36400,"Despite its storied history, it looks almost pristine. I suspect the monks tended to it regularly."
36401,"It shall prove quite the challenge to bring back...but I daresay my falcon and I are up to the task! Pray accept my unending gratitude for your assistance, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
36402,"A clash for the ages! Life-threatening circumstances aside, 'tis always a pleasure to witness bushido at work."
36403,"I had guessed the passage we traversed would lead us to the stores' most valuable contents─lo and behold!"
36404,"Such exceptional relics are a rarity indeed...this armor not least of all."
36405,"The spirit that enlivened it may have been one of the very tsukumogami of rumor."
36406,"In an ideal world, I would not hesitate to bring home every last blade the mononoke touched... Alas, my falcon can only bear so much weight."
36407,"This calls for serious consideration... Pray leave me to my thoughts for a moment."
36408,"How pleasingly picturesque! Had we no demons to slay, I would suggest a more leisurely stroll."
36409,"I shudder to think of the chaos should those creatures find their way to civilization..."
36410,"I suppose we're obliged to take the scenic route."
36411,"That ahead is Shojo Temple, home to Gorai and his accursed collection!"
36412,"If only we had time for the typical ablutions... But a proper pilgrimage must wait for another day."
36413,"For now, treasure awaits! As do the monk and his minions, of course. Do have care."
36414,"I admit that I was equally tempted to pull that rope, though part of me wishes you hadn't..."
36415,"The statues keep silent vigil in their masters' absence...but they are not the treasures we seek. Onward!"
36416,"The temple stretches on ever further. Step lively, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! We've plenty to explore."
36417,"Even the inner sanctum is plagued with demons. If any who remained did survive, 'twould be nothing short of a miracle."
36418,"Splendid as these statues are, they appear lacking in the “accursed” aspect. Our quarry must lie further in."
36419,"Though the temple's isolation is a blessing for the smallfolk, I imagine it made the monks' experience all the more harrowing..."
36420,"We have yet to see hide nor hair of Gorai..."
36421,"Breathtaking! 'Tis as though the majestic tiger it depicts might pounce off the screen at any─ Oh?"
36422,"That was <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> an invitation! Your assistance, please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
36423,"That precarious pile of crates is a mountain unto itself! "
36424,"Somehow, I doubt that brute has learned its lesson... But let us continue on."
36425,"By the kami, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, how did you get up there?"
36426,"Adventurers and their climbing... Why, just the other day, on Kugane Tower─ But perhaps that is a tale for another time."
36427,"That sounded promising... If you suddenly hear my winsome wailing, you had best come running!"
36428,"Ah, a secret stairwell! How very convenient."
36429,"Both master and minion, irascible to the last..."
36430,"Tokimori's words ring true. These creatures allow for not a modicum of mercy."
36431,"With your victory, we may now free the mountain of Gorai's influence─by liberating these treasures from his collection, of course."
36432,"Any one of them may have harbored spiritual forces. Perhaps all of them─it would certainly explain Gorai's impressive transformation."
36433,"As for which deserves a place in my collection... Gorai's biwa, of course! A fine addition."
36434,"And with that, we may be on our way. Your company has been a pleasure as always, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
36435,"And so the demon is slain!"
36436,"Though his avarice availed him curious tools, your skill carried the day."
36437,"One wonders what artifacts he might have unveiled had you waited a touch longer to deal the killing blow...but there's naught to be done about it now. "
36438,"Naught but to take the lesson of his life to heart, perhaps. Never shirk the proper appraisal of items with dubious histories!"
36439,"Bearing this firmly in mind, I shall help myself to that hammer of his."
36440,"'Twas an honor and a privilege to accompany you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Shall we begin our preparations for the journey back?"
36441,"Admirable as always, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Few would be so keen to face down a rat of that size."
36442,"To say naught of his unusual sousing. When the unholy draught touched his lips, I feared his fury would consume the entire temple."
36443,"I should like to know precisely what baleful influence was wrought upon the drink...but not enough to test it myself."
36444,"Nay, I must bring back a less volatile artifact of our endeavors..."
36445,"The living lanterns─chochin, as the Hingans say─were particularly fascinating, were they not? "
36446,"Now that they are returned to their original form, I may safely seek to learn more of the spirits they once harbored. Let us add them to my collection forthwith!"
36447,"Curious... This lantern shines differently than the rest. The mononoke's influence, perhaps?"
36448,"No, some other mechanism. What if I..."
36449,"Lesson learned, Hancock─do <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> prod eerily glowing objects!"
36450,"In any case, the monks went to great pains to conceal this path. What could have warranted such secrecy?"
36451,"Kami forfend! We could suffocate under this wicked haze..."
36452,"I'd wager the tsukumogami is the pipe itself─its body a mere illusion."
36453,"A brilliant display! With the demonic smoke dispelled, we may breathe easy once more."
36454,"Only an entity of great power could transform its surrounds so dramatically. You did well to outmaneuver it."
36455,"Now, I espied something resting within the shrine earlier..."
36456,"I have seen depictions of this pipe before. There can be no doubt that it is an age-old treasure."
36457,"Gorai must have known that a fierce tsukumogami slumbered within it. Thus he stored it apart, far from the sanctity of the temple..."
36458,"But its will was too strong to be consigned to such ignominy, and in its neglect, its power only grew. Until it was strong enough to enshroud the mount entire... "
36459,"Now that this lord among demons is slain, we can assume that peace shall return to the region. We must report the good news to Mistress Tsubaki posthaste!"
36460,"I─and my growing collection─should not have fared half so well without you here. I am in your debt! "
36461,"Shrink before my might! Quiver in awe!"
36462,"A path straight up the holy mount, is it? How refreshingly dangerous!"
36463,"Why, these hills stretch on for malms! Would that they were not alive with the sound of demons."
36464,"The Hingans call these clay figures “dogu”─but why is one here, of all places?"
36465,"Best to let sleeping dogu lie. For all we know, it could be cursed."
36466,"If that dogu turns on us, its extermination shall be <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> responsibility, I hope you know!"
36467,"Fallen leaves and fresh greenery in such close proximity? 'Tis passing strange."
36468,"There are few things more breathtaking than autumnal leaves...even if they are out of season. The influence of a treasure, I suspect."
36469,"I understand you adventurers enjoy the roads less traveled, but─ And there <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> goes. Courage, Hancock!"
36470,"Such a tranquil place, these mountain heights. By the look of it, I presume it is not a path that many tread."
36471,"Hmm... 'Tis not the first of those stones we've encountered. Do they serve as shrines of some sort?"
36472,"No shrine is built without purpose...or so I have heard. If such is the case, then what might this one be for?"
36473,"Oho! I knew from the first that the dogu was meant for something greater."
36474,"I, for one, have <Emphasis>naught but respect</Emphasis> for our new clay comrade! ...Do you think it can hear us?"
36475,"The warding talismans on this boulder give me pause...but it shall serve as well as any bridge, I suppose."
36476,"One cannot go wrong with a rustic log bridge─assuming the trunk is free of angry spirits, of course..."
36477,"Gods be good! I know not how, but the statue has awakened...and it did <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> wake on the right side of the proverbial bed!"
36478,"Just a moment─I have read of this before! If I am not mistaken, that mononoke is Shishio, king among nue!"
36479,"Even a king of beasts is no match for you, I see! Well done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
36480,"The most, in a word, <Emphasis>vivid</Emphasis> Shishio myth tells of its ravenous rampage across the countryside. It had quite the appetite for mortal flesh!"
36481,"'Tis also said that its harrowing cry is a harbinger of misfortune, but I say we should consider ourselves lucky to have chanced upon a living legend."
36482,"As for what freed it of its lithic bonds... Perhaps the revelry of its fellow mononoke roused its fighting spirit."
36483,"Alas, the beast held no treasures of Gorai's, but fret not─I shall make do with what we have here and claim a suitable souvenir."
36484,"Though our hike was fraught with peril, 'twas exhilarating in equal measure! You have my thanks, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
36485,"A deed fit for legend! Quite literally, for Shishio appears in countless Hingan myths."
36486,"One, in fact, tells of a wayfaring warrior who triumphed over it long ago."
36487,"As such, I was aware that its harrowing cry could warp the very earth...but to see it firsthand is a wholly different beast, I'm sure you agree."
36488,"Though the creature bore none of Gorai's treasures, we can take comfort in the knowledge that it will terrorize Lord Uzumibi's people no more."
36489,"...And in the no less valuable artifacts we've spotted over the course of our journey to the summit, naturally."
36490,"All that remains is to carry the spoils to our waiting falcons. I trust I can count on you?"
36491,"That is one mononoke felled─though if the legends are to be believed, Shishio is a wholly different beast than its tsukumogami brethren."
36492,"It came to the mountain long before Gorai's time─was sealed here by the very founder of Shojo Temple, in fact."
36493,"'Tis enough to make one wonder if that boulder we felled did not possess some greater significance..."
36494,"But let us turn from that dark path, and instead appreciate the sacred scenery before us! Breathtaking, is it not?"
36495,"...Do let me know if you spy any artifacts of value. I should like something to commemorate this trek."
36496,"You, of course, must have my sincerest thanks for making the perilous climb!"
36497,"A harrowing display! Such ferocity have I rarely seen!"
36498,"And Shishio was quite fearsome as well. It puts me in the mind of the Western chimera."
36499,"Yet of all that I have seen today, I am most taken with the dogu. I admit, I had my doubts...but to restore life to nature is no common feat."
36500,"I should like to take it back to Kugane. On the off chance it is sentient, we must hope it sees fit to forgive my earlier misgivings."
36501,"Our risks thus far have paid fine dividends, and I have you to thank for it. You have my utmost gratitude, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
36502,"You have done well to forestall your fate... But your end is come!"
36503,"The chorus of steel rings eternal!"
36504,"Mark where the armor readies its blade─though it has quite a reach, it cannot strike everywhere at once!"
36505,"Could this be an accursed treasure, I wonder? That blade in the box we encountered was rather suspicious as well..."
36506,"A sorry attempt at an ambush, if you ask me...but let us continue on."

37425,"On your guard, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I think the bait was <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> tasty!"
37426,"This is perfect! I can feel it─this will lure out something <Emphasis>big</Emphasis>!"
37427,"The fish here are more trouble than they're worth. Let's try somewhere else!"
37428,"I can sense it... A great catch is just ahead!"
37429,"Wh-wh-what is that!? Whales aren't supposed to fly!"
37430,"I was frozen in fear...but you had it well in hand, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! "
37431,"This is a promising spot. I'd best get my rod ready!"
37432,"May I hook a wonderful gift for Nidhana!"
37433,"So many wrecked ships. Is it all the work of that flying monstrosity?"
37434,"Oh, it's a Narunnairian octopus. I could've caught this in Thavnair..."
37435,"No matter─to have come this far is rewarding in of itself! And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37436,"I was frozen in fear...but you had it well in hand, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! "
37437,"This is a promising spot. I'd best get my rod ready!"
37438,"May I hook a wonderful gift for Nidhana!"
37439,"The creatures of this isle can effortlessly scale cliffs and soar through the sky... What other surprises does Aloalo have in store?"
37440,"Ah, a puff-paya. Rather common in Thavnairian waters, but delicious when prepared correctly."
37441,"Still, the journey was exciting, so thank you for accompanying me! And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37442,"I was frozen in fear...but you had it well in hand, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! "
37443,"And now I can fish to my heart's content. With the sun setting, I'm sure my catch will be grand!"
37444,"May I hook a wonderful gift for Nidhana!"
37445,"I apologize that this expedition has taken so long. My last catch may have been less than satisfactory, but I promise to make up for it this time!"
37446,"Oh no, it got away with the bait! It must have been something truly extraordinary..."
37447,"Nevertheless, I must thank you for escorting me all this way. And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37448,"I was frozen in fear...but you had it well in hand, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! "
37449,"And now I can fish to my heart's content. With the sun setting, I'm sure my catch will be grand!"
37450,"May I hook a wonderful gift for Nidhana!"
37451,"And should something else emerge from the water, let us hope it is nothing so formidable as that whale..."
37452,"Oh my, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>... I have plucked many prizes from the sea, but nothing quite like this!"
37453,"We have been blessed with great fortune indeed. But would an alchemist have any use for it, I wonder..."
37454,"I'll ask Pasasun to study it as soon as we return. Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, for watching over me!"
37455,"Thavnair's jungles can be dense and difficult to traverse, but this swamp is no less daunting..."
37456,"What strange worms! I doubt they would make for good bait."
37457,"The water's changed! The poison from those pods must have contaminated it."
37458,"What's that...? A Miqo'te!? But Kalika said this island was deserted."
37459,"What's that...? A Miqo'te!? But Kalika said this island was deserted."
37460,"The path keeps climbing. Could there still be fishing spots above us?"
37461,"<shudder> ...Don't look down, don't look down."
37462,"People lived here? How did they find the courage to build so high up?"
37463,"Look, they formed a path!"
37464,"Hmph, took you long enough! You'll pay for what you did!"
37465,"Look, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, water! And where there's water, there's fish!"
37466,"Something doesn't smell right... Be careful, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
37467,"You did it! I was worried for a moment, but then I remembered who I was with."
37468,"Now I can fish at my leisure. What awaits us atop this mighty tree?"
37469,"May my catch bring a smile to Nidhana's face!"
37470,"What was that thing saying? I couldn't understand a word."
37471,"A fish...? No, just seaweed."
37472,"Not the most exciting catch, but I am still grateful to have come this far─all thanks to you, of course. And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37473,"I should've known you'd get through that with nary a scratch. Well done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
37474,"Now I can fish at my leisure. What awaits us atop this mighty tree?"
37475,"May my catch bring a smile to Nidhana's face!"
37476,"The scent of such vibrant nature calms the mind. The people who once lived here must have felt at peace in its embrace."
37477,"Is this...a branch? I guess it sunk all the way to the bottom."
37478,"Not the best end, but still a thrilling journey! And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37479,"It appears the only way forward is down..."
37480,"Impressive as always, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I'm glad you're none the worse for wear."
37481,"Now I can fish at my leisure. What awaits us atop this mighty tree?"
37482,"May my catch bring a smile to Nidhana's face!"
37483,"Sliding down that branch was an experience I'll not soon forget! But I shudder to think what would've happened if we had shifted even an ilm in the wrong direction..."
37484,"This fish is...absolutely exquisite!"
37485,"I've no familiarity with the bounty of heights such as this, but I am certain its beauty is only surpassed by its flavor!"
37486,"Pasasun will no doubt be eager to study it as well. Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, for accompanying me!"
37487,"Good work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, although I'm hardly surprised you triumphed."
37488,"Now I can fish at my leisure. What awaits us atop this mighty tree?"
37489,"May my catch bring a smile to Nidhana's face!"
37490,"The branches grew almost as if on command. Aloalo's secrets never cease to amaze..."
37491,"Oh no, it got away! I was so close!"
37492,"...A disappointing end, but the journey alone was well worth it. And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37493,"People once lived here. And people build near the best fishing spots!"
37494,"I can barely make out my own hands."
37495,"I see a great spot to fish just ahead. Let's go, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
37496,"That's...a person! But Kalika said Aloalo was deserted."
37497,"Phew... Now we can move forward. I know good fishing awaits!"
37498,"We've climbed quite a ways. I wonder if there are fish to be found up here?"
37499,"You there! If it's treasure you seek, I can help!"
37500,"Yes, yes, I know where great riches are kept. I can guide you there with a snap of my fingers!"
37501,"Are we even on the same island? And where did that faerie go?"
37502,"You've made it! As for the treasure you seek─it's right over there!"
37503,"Hahaha! You fell for it! Fools!"
37504,"Don't go that way if you value your lives! Come back!"
37505,"Bah, you've <Emphasis>ruined</Emphasis> it! If you won't play properly, then I'm going home!"
37506,"And there I thought you'd be fun. Fine! May the sun bleach your bones!"
37507,"I think we made her mad... Wait, how do we get out of here?"
37508,"Here! A bit overgrown, but I can clear the way. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, stay on my heels!"
37509,"Look, more statues. It's almost as if they've been waiting for someone..."
37510,"A lever to open a door, it would seem. We can continue onward."
37511,"<shiver> A bit chilly, don't you think? Too cold for people to have lived here, perhaps."
37512,"The path opened! Your prayers were heard!"
37513,"Did you say something, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? I thought I heard a voice just now..."
37514,"So many traps, but to what end? All I wanted to do was fish..."
37515,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, are you there!? I can't see a thing through this mist!"
37516,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, are you there!? I can't see a thing through this mist!"
37517,"Are all faeries so temperamental? I don't think we've seen the last of that one... Keep your eyes peeled, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
37518,"Let that be a lesson in proper manners!
I can hear water coming from deeper inside─let's go, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
37519,"Just as I had hoped─a fishing spot! May it yield a catch that will bring a smile to Nidhana's face!"
37520,"He's the one who summoned that wooden monstrosity! What is it now?"
37521,"The faerie's chamber was full of odd...I don't even know if “tools” would be the right word for them."
37522,"It's...a shoe covered in moss. That didn't happen overnight─do you think it belonged to the faerie?"
37523,"...Either way, I owe you thanks for accompanying me on this journey. And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37524,"We made it through the mist. I feared we might be going in circles, but our senses proved true!"
37525,"Let that be a lesson in proper manners!
I can hear water coming from deeper inside─let's go!"
37526,"Just as I had hoped─a fishing spot! May it yield a catch that will bring a smile to Nidhana's face!"
37527,"よーし……
気合を入れて、釣りを開始するだす！"
37528,"This fishing spot is almost worth the trouble that faerie caused. Almost..."
37529,"That mist earlier felt unnatural. I wonder what fishing spots it might be hiding..."
37530,"This is...a bucket. I suppose that explains the weight."
37531,"...It is of no use to us, I'm afraid. Even so, we should be proud to have come so far. And since I can still see fish in the water, perhaps I ought to try my luck a little more before we depart."
37532,"We made it through the mist. I feared we might be going in circles, but our senses proved true!"
37533,"Let that be a lesson in proper manners!
I can hear water coming from deeper inside─let's go!"
37534,"Just as I had hoped─a fishing spot! May it yield a catch that will bring a smile to Nidhana's face!"
37535,"よーし……
気合を入れて、釣りを開始するだす！"
37536,"Did you see all that junk strewn about the faerie's chamber? How long do you think it took to amass such a cache?"
37537,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, look! It's a fish, but...there's something odd about it."
37538,"I'm not sure, but I don't believe this species is found in Thavnair. An alchemist like Nidhana might treasure it..."
37539,"Pasasun will no doubt be eager to study it as well. Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, for accompanying me!"
37540,"Oh my... The statue is carved into the tree itself! Could it be the Speaker Kalika serves!?"
37541,"That must be the jewel. The source of Aloalo's vitality."
37542,"●へへ……ここまで付き合ってくれて、あんたに感謝だす！"
37543,"Any fishing spots this close to the jewel must be teeming with rare fish!"
37544,"It's time to fish like I've never fished before!"
37545,"After all we have endured, I must claim a catch to remember for moons to come!"
37546,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Have you ever seen such a fish!?"
37547,"I don't know if the jewel spurred its growth, but this is one of the biggest I've ever caught!"
37548,"Thank you for looking after me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I must ask Pasasun if he knows anything about this amazing specimen."
37549,"Intruders detected. Initializing computational engine... Calculating optimal tactics."
37550,"Calculations complete. Deploying arcane measures to eliminate intruders."
37551,"Recalculating optimal tactics... Commencing terrestrial assault."

37555,"Gods, that smarts! Seems I'm in over my head, so...good luck!"
37556,"It flies! Like something out of a children's tale!"
37557,"Remember me? I ain't the kind of scoundrel what shirks his debts, so I'll help you out─just this once."
37558,"Now we're even! So if you'll excuse me, I've got a treasure to plunder!"
37559,"You in the habit of leavin' people for dead!? I'll make you wish those beasts finished me off!"
37560,"Bloody─! Better escape while I still have my head!"
37561,"Plenty of wind and water...just what I need to call my minions!"
37562,"These are even nastier than the last! Don't let them take a bite out of you!"
37563,"おつかれさま……！
あんたは本当に強いヒトだす！"
37564,"You're here too!? Then I must be on the right track!"
37565,"If it's all the same to you, I'll go on ahead. Mind keepin' my pet company in the meantime?"
37566,"If <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> went down this path, that means the treasure's at the end of it!"
37567,"Know if this thing eats? Well, <Emphasis>you'll</Emphasis> find out soon enough! That jewel is ours!"
37568,"J-Just let us have the treasure, and no one needs to get hurt!"
37569,"If you insist on staying the course, you'll have to deal with Quaqua. I can't guarantee your safety! "
37570,"This beast is made from wood! Where did they find it!?"
37571,"It conjured weapons from thin air!"
37572,"More weapons! Those hammers look heavy enough to shatter stone!"
37573,"It called monsters to its aid! Don't let them catch you!"
37574,"Be careful! The flames move like waves!"
37575,"So many of them! Where will you run to!?"
37576,"Its arsenal is endless! Sisters protect me from those blades!"
37577,"Lightning rains from the sky! We mustn't stand still!"
37578,"Spears of water!? Oh gods, here they come!"
37579,"The water is spilling forth! Can you manage, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
37580,"It's using the fetid water as a weapon!"
37581,"Watch out! You don't want dirty water in your boots!"
37582,"What are those orbs!?"
37583,"Huh!? The statues are emitting light!"
37584,"What!? The light swallowed the orbs!"
37585,"The statues must house ancient power. I'm glad they're on our side."
37586,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, look. Something's happening to the statues."
37587,"We made it. None of its weapons could match yours, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
37588,"What a wicked trap!"
37589,"You saw right through her tricks! Well done!"
37590,"More treasure chests...don't pick the wrong one!"

37592,"I saw it! Watch your step, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
37593,"This looks like a good spot to fish. Can we stop for a moment?"

37609,"Gather round, one and all! I've prepared a special gift for this very special day!"
37610,"How did you like them? Find one that tickles your fancy?"
37611,"Hahaha! I just love that sound!"
37612,"No, no, no! You have to step on the cushion!"

41119,"Take your starting position when you are ready to begin."
41120,"As you doubtless know, no few magicks strike a wide radius around a given target. The marker of such an attack will often look like this..."
41121,"If you sense that you've been marked, you'd do well to move away from your allies so that they aren't caught in the blast."
41122,"The danger is greater still if an ally is targeted at the same time. Stand too close to one another, and you will suffer double the impact!"
41123,"Careful─you were too close to your ally just now. As you maneuver, you must be sure to mind each other's positions."
41124,"Our next exercise features a strike so powerful, it cannot be endured alone. Allow me to demonstrate its marker..."
41125,"Should the enemy perform such an attack, you and your allies must stand together in order to weather it."
41126,"Upon sensing this marker, locate its target and make your way there as quick as you can!"
41127,"Oh dear, you didn't reach your ally in time. Your absence was felt most painfully..."
41128,"Next, we will look at a lethal variety of attack that none but a tank can handle. Behold its marker..."
41129,"Remember, only the tank is equipped to survive a blow of this magnitude. Any other caught in its blast won't be left standing."
41130,"Now for a proper demonstration. Everyone, position yourselves so that the tank may shield against this strike alone!"
41131,"Dear me, that must have hurt. Only the tank is equipped to endure such a brutal blow, all right? Let's try it again."
41132,"Next, let us practice how to handle a more persistent threat. Take note of this marker..."
41133,"What will follow is a chain of attacks that chase you doggedly. You must stay on the move, all the while keeping away from your allies."
41134,""
41135,"Remember, you must evade the barrage while leading it away from your allies!"
41136,"Allow me to test all that you have learned thus far."
41137,"In this exercise, you will face a slew of different attacks, each of which you must deal with appropriately to minimize the harm you sustain."
41138,"Oh dear, a party member was caught in the attack. Remember to be mindful of your allies' positions."
41139,"Gods above! Not only did you hurt your poor ally, but you stood on unsafe ground as well!"
41140,"Alas, you didn't reach your ally in time. A painful lesson..."
41141,"Tsk-tsk. Not only did you fail to stand with your ally, you stood on unsafe ground as well!"
41142,"Ye gods...that can't have been pleasant. Lest you forget, only the tank can withstand such lethal attacks."
41143,"Are you all right!? That attack wasn't meant for more than the tank─and on unsafe ground, no less!"
41144,"Unfortunately, you failed to evade all of the attacks, and have thereby failed this objective."
41145,"It would seem the attack targeting you inadvertently struck a party member. You'll need to retry this objective."
41146,"You and your ally were both hit, I noticed. I'm afraid you have failed this objective."
41147,"Alas, you didn't pass the challenge. Retake your starting position, and let's give it one more try! "
41148,"You handled every last threat with finesse. It is with pleasure that I declare you have passed the challenge!"

41155,"Precisely what I had hoped to see!"
41156,"I'm pleased you took the lesson to heart."
41157,"Among you adventurers, I'm given to understand that these are known as “stack markers.” Rings odd to my ear, but I suppose it matters not."
41158,"These attacks pack quite a punch. Should it fall to you to deal with it, you'd do well to employ what abilities you have to lighten the damage."

41219,"My agent here will serve as your opponent. Try to get a sense for her oncoming attacks, and handle them accordingly."
41220,"Take your starting position when you are ready to begin."
41221,"First, let's discuss knockback attacks. The marker will look like this..."
41222,"As soon as you sense it, you will have but a few moments to position yourself before you are pushed a set distance from its point of impact."
41223,"For this exercise, I have placed a ring of lightning aether around the arena. Your goal is to position yourself such that you won't be sent hurtling into it!"
41224,"Oh dear... That lightning must have given you quite the nasty jolt. Try to stand as close as you can to the point of impact!"
41225,"While we're at it, let's review a common variant. Take note of <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> marker..."
41226,"Unlike last time, I don't recommend you stand directly in the center of it, lest you receive a most painful blow to the skull."
41227,"And so, once more, I challenge you to avoid being flung into the lightning. Where will you stand this time?"
41228,"Remember, the glowing ground is itself a potent attack, and thus unsafe to stand in. Let's have you retry this objective."
41229,"That lightning is rather unpleasant to the touch, isn't it? I suggest you stand at the very <Emphasis>edge</Emphasis> of the area of effect attack."
41230,"Next, we'll demonstrate a proximity attack. Its marker pulses outward, like so..."
41231,"With these, the closer you are to its point of impact, the greater the damage you stand to take."
41232,"Thus, whenever you see that ominous light pulsing along the ground, I advise you to distance yourself as much as possible."
41233,"Too close to the point of impact! You want to keep your distance from these to minimize the damage."
41234,"Next, let's move on to tower tactics! This type of attack is one that must be endured rather than avoided."
41235,"See the tower marker? If no one stands inside to weaken its impact, the entire party will suffer a devastating blow."
41236,"Therefore, one person must volunteer to take the tower, shielding the rest of the party from far greater casualties."
41237,"And <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> is what happens when a tower is left unoccupied. Remember, this is a team effort!"
41238,"Now let's cover a variant of the tower marker. Again, one of you will need to stand inside to protect the others."
41239,"Lest you forget, if the tower goes unoccupied, the entire party will pay the price."
41240,"In this case, you must ensure you are standing within the bounds of the circle before the arcane orb strikes the ground."
41241,"And <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> is what happens when a tower is left unoccupied. Remember, this is a team effort!"
41242,"Allow me to test all that you have learned thus far."
41243,"In this exercise, you will face a slew of different attacks, each of which you must deal with appropriately to minimize the harm you sustain."
41244,"Oh dear, straight into the lightning... Try to stand a bit closer to the point of impact next time."
41245,"Poor thing. Not only were you knocked into the lightning, but you stood on unsafe ground as well."
41246,"Alas, you were too close to the proximity attack. Let's have you retry the objective."
41247,"By the gods... Not only did you take a nasty blow from the attack, but your empty tower inflicted catastrophic injury upon the rest of your party..."
41248,"Lesson learned: an empty tower <Emphasis>hurts</Emphasis>. Whenever you see one, be not afraid to stand against the attack─your allies will thank you!"
41249,"I'm afraid you stood too close to the proximity attack. You'll need to retry the objective."
41250,"Lesson learned: an empty tower <Emphasis>hurts</Emphasis>. Whenever you see one, be not afraid to stand against the attack─your allies will thank you!"
41251,"Focus, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>Mistress<Else/>Master</If> <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>! Not only did your tower go unoccupied, but you stood on unsafe ground as well!"
41252,"Alas, you didn't pass the challenge. Retake your starting position, and let's give it one more try!"
41253,"You handled every last threat with finesse. It is with pleasure that I declare you have passed the challenge!"
41254,"Commencing in 3..."

41256,"1..."
41257,"Let the exercise begin!"
41258,"To start the next exercise, take your starting position."

41260,"Precisely what I had hoped to see!"
41261,"I'm pleased you took the lesson to heart."

41319,"Take your starting position when you are ready to begin."
41320,"For your first exercise, allow me to demonstrate the proximity tether. Its marker looks like this..."
41321,"When entangled with one of these, to remain near the enemy is to risk suffering a painful strike."
41322,"Instead, use what precious few moments you have to retreat until the tether's magicks weaken!"
41323,"You must move away until the tether visibly changes. Try again!"
41324,"Before we move on, there is another type of tether attack I wish to cover. Take note of <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> marker..."
41325,"Unlike proximity tethers, these can be intercepted at will, allowing you to sustain a blow on another's behalf."
41326,"For this exercise, let's suppose your enemy intends to detonate a bomb. To prevent a lethal explosion, your only recourse is to shield the bomb yourself!"
41327,"An excellent demonstration...of an unmitigated explosion. Let's try again."
41328,"Next, I will teach you how to defend against a gaze attack. Behold its marker..."
41329,"When the spell is cast, all those facing its direction will suffer some manner of unpleasant effect─in this case, petrification."
41330,"Fortunately, the solution is simple: you need but turn away from the enemy to neutralize its effects entirely!"
41331,"Ha, caught you looking! Have another go."
41332,"For your next exercise, let us discuss status effects such as poison or paralysis─and, more importantly, the curing thereof."
41333,"While there are full many varieties of combat ailments, a fair few can be swiftly relieved with Esuna."
41334,"So, let's get a feel for this by having our healer do the honors, shall we?"
41335,"For this exercise, let's see you evade the attack as soon as Esuna has done its job!"
41336,"おっと、状態異常を治療できなかったようですね。
残念ながら、対処は失敗となります。"
41337,"Your Esuna was just a touch too slow, I'm afraid. Not to worry─we can retry the objective."
41338,"Alas, you didn't quite dodge that attack. Be prepared to move as soon as you are cured!"
41339,"Allow me to test all that you have learned thus far."
41340,"In this exercise, you will face a slew of different attacks, each of which you must deal with appropriately to minimize the harm you sustain."
41341,"That proximity tether wasn't weakened enough. You'll need to retry the objective."
41342,"Careful, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>Mistress<Else/>Master</If> <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>! Not only were you too close to the enemy, but you stood on unsafe ground as well!"
41343,"Don't forget to take the tether from the bomb! You'll need to retry the objective."
41344,"That was not your tether to take, my friend! Unfortunately, you will need to retry the objective."
41345,"Tsk-tsk! You were caught looking at the enemy's gaze attack. You'll have to retry this objective."
41346,"Oh dear. Not only were you caught looking at the gaze attack, but you stood on unsafe ground as well."
41347,"おっと、味方全員の状態異常を治療できなかったようですね。
