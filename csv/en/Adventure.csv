Such were the little boy's words, and I would see as he saw.","Named after a failed attempt by an ambitious Gridanian merchant to hatch and breed apkallus in the linn, Apkallu Falls is most remembered for serving as a place of meditation for the late Louisoix Leveilleur, Circle of Knowing Archon and hero of Eorzea."

Such were the stablehand's words, and I would see as he saw.","Once Moogle's Gift Mounts was established and its rookery stocked with Ishgard's finest birds, it was not long before an entire settlement had grown up around the stables. The trademark balloon tethered to the main building is actually an Ixali war vessel claimed by chocobokeeps after it became tangled in a nearby tree and was abandoned by its riders."

Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as he saw.","This sky-scraping ivory cathedral was built following the Age of Endless Frost─a dark period in which the realm was overrun with famine and disease─to serve as a place of refuge and respite for all who sought succor. Soon after, however, it fell into ruin and was all but forgotten...until the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era saw need for its rise once again."

Lights dancing in the dark before me, I ponder what mischief I might make─er, were I a sylph, that is."" Such were the scholar's words, and I would see as he saw.","Little is the solace granted to those sylphs who would voice their opposition to the summoning of the Lord of Levin. Little is the solace bequeathed upon those who would abandon their homes in the Sylphlands and shun their frenzied brethren. Thus, it is only through fraternity that those sylphs may ultimately find solace, however little it may be."

Paying reverence to those who came before us, I salute my sworn brothers who stand before me."" Such were the Sultansworn's words, and I would see as he saw.","In times when the sultan had sole rule over the city–state, the Promenade would serve as an ersatz waiting chamber for those petitioners who sought audience with His Resplendence in the Fragrant Chamber. Now, with power in the hands of the Syndicate, the round is empty, save for the occasional tryst betwixt young nobles."

Such were the acrobat's words, and I would see as he saw.","A large atrium in the heart of Ul'dah, the Gold Court's opulence and scale make it a popular meeting place for the city's elite. The plaza was once reserved for the sultan's private balls, but has since been opened to the public due to a lack of funds to maintain the majestic hanging fountain at her center."

Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as she saw.","The commercial hub of Ul'dah is organized strategically around the dome-shaped citadel at its center. Its towering fortifications and protective outer walls bedighted with myriad glass panes and colorful mosaics are visible for malms in all directions, and serve as a stark yet dazzling deterrent to would-be besiegers."

My foot slipped, and in an eyeblink I was sprawled out on a cliff, the ruins of a buried city before me. Sadly, the stinging pain in my arse detracted somewhat from my enjoyment of the scenery."" Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.","The city–states of Ul'dah and Sil'dih coexisted for generations until four hundred years ago when bad blood festering betwixt the two sultanates culminated in the War of the Sisters─leaving Sil'dih a smoldering pile of rubble to be claimed by the shifting desert sands. The subsequent relocation of Ul'dah placed the city–state nearly directly above her fallen sibling."

Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as she saw.","Local legend claims the Lonely Giant is everything from the ghost of a Sil'dihn sultan, to the prototype for a new model of Garlean machina. Ul'dahn scholars, however, simply believe him a Coerthan goobbue who lost his bearings during the chaos of the Calamity, and after a long journey through the Black Shroud, died of exhaustion upon reaching Thanalan."

I know not who once called it home, nor why it fell, but it was a sight to behold."" Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.","Buried under nearly a malm of solid rock, if not for a gaping rent torn open by the Calamity, these ancient ruins may have gone undiscovered for another thousand summers. Scholars sent to Highbridge to study the site are currently of a mind that the structures are not a city, but in fact the tomb of one Lalafuto IV, famed sultan of Belah'dia."

Setting out at first light, I looked out upon the wise men of old─at least they looked wiser than me─and asked for guidance in my travels."" Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.","After the Calamity rent eastern Thanalan asunder, one of the first projects commissioned by the Syndicate was the construction of a bridge to span the newly formed chasm and restore the trade route with lands transpontine. The city which has sprung up along its edges is populated almost solely by scholars investigating the nearby ruins of the Invisible City."
