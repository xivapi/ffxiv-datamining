As the base of operations for the reconstruction effort, the Mendicant's Court can be likened to a home to us. And a home, if nothing else, should be cheery and welcoming.

To that end, I propose that we improve the ambience of the court by refurbishing the skybuilders' board and lighting the braziers. A worthwhile cause, I hope you will agree, and help me to make it possible by contributing the necessary supplies.

89,"Owing to the tireless efforts of our esteemed skybuilders, the Firmament stands completed in all its resplendent glory. To mark this most momentous of occasions, and to bid welcome to visitors from lands near and far to our new home, we are presently hosting a festival─the Skyrise Celebration.

Chief among the amusements at the festival are diverting games known as fêtes, and attractive prizes await those who participate. We hope that you will find a moment to join us in the revelry.

During an event period, several fêtes are held in succession and offer rewards to participants.

We look forward to seeing artisans of all persuasions out there taking part in these light-hearted challenges.",,0
