1,"TEXT_CLSWDK550_01999_SEQ_01","Barthovieu fought the good fight, but to no avail─his arrows could not pierce Nguruvilu's scales. He avoided death narrowly because a passing priest saved his life. Now, Barthovieu wishes to repay the debt, and turns to you for help. It appears the good brother is something of a conjurer, who would no doubt welcome a new staff. Speak with the Orthodox monastic at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard, and see what kind of cane he would like."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK550_01999_SEQ_02","The priest is a jolly fellow, who has apparently already refused a gift of thanks once. However, he is in need of a new staff, and gives in to your gracious offer. Fashion for him a high-quality dark chestnut rod, so that he may better his ministrations."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK550_01999_SEQ_03","The priest is delighted with the rod, but admits he had not expected anything so grand. You are perplexed for a moment, until Philipallais enters with a brace of fowl. It so happens that the child had actually asked the priest to watch over his father, and had promised him a gift of thanks for the service. The confusion cleared up, the priest takes his leave of you. Philipallais asks you in a quiet voice to keep all this secret from his father, for fear that Barthovieu's pride would suffer. Return now to Barthovieu, and inform him that the priest has been properly thanked."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK550_01999_SEQ_04","Barthovieu is pleased your work has settled any debt he owed the priest. He reaffirms his intent to go after Nguruvilu, but only after a fair bit of time spent honing his skills with the bow.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Barthovieu upon reaching level 58."
