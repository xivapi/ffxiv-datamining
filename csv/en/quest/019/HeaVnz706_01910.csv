1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ706_01910_SEQ_01","Guna Vanu tells you the tragic tale of his brother Gunu Vanu, who is on his way to being the only member of the Zundu to fail his rite of passage eight times. Another failure would ensure their family's place as a laughingstock in the tribe's history, and Guna Vanu begs you to help his brother pass his rite─but first you have to find him. Find out where he could be by asking the Vanu of Ok' Zundu for his whereabouts."
