1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ833_01963_SEQ_01","Midnight Dew's entire stock has been stolen by a band of thieves, who have been seen escaping into the Sharlayan ruins. She asks you to assist her in tracking the bandits down, and bids you meet with her in the Answering Quarter to begin the hunt."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ833_01963_SEQ_02","You meet with Midnight Dew in the Answering Quarter and she briefs you on her plan to catch the robbers. As the stock they stole is too heavy to be transported on foot, she predicts that the bandits hope to escape by boat. While she contacts her comrades to have them stake out the riverbank, she asks that you investigate the Answering Quarter ruins to see if any sign of the bandits or their ill-gotten booty yet remains."
