1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ711_01915_SEQ_01","Gunu Vanu has only one more family member to copy for his rite of passage─his brother, whose offering was to display his skill at riding the traditional Vanu mount, a sanuwa. Gunu Vanu, as always, has a shortcut in mind for this trial. Meet him at the Blue Window to hear his plans."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ711_01915_SEQ_02","Gunu Vanu presents you with some leather reins that he claims will make any tame sanuwa obey your every order. He points out one such sanuwa positioned conveniently nearby. It may not be the ideal choice of prey however, since its owner stands nearby and will likely not give up the steed without a fight. Nonetheless, since no alternative target presents itself, use the leather reins on the battle-trained sanuwa and hope for the best."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ711_01915_SEQ_03","After using the reins on the sanuwa, its current owner rightly attacks you, leaving you with no choice but to defend yourself. Retrieve the borrowed sanuwa."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ711_01915_SEQ_04","You have retrieved the sanuwa. Return to Gunu Vanu and tell him of the noble deed you have performed."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ711_01915_SEQ_05","Gunu Vanu once again shows his courage by answering the sudden and conveniently timed summons of the elder shaman. Although you did not hear the call, Gunu Vanu is already yalms ahead of you. Catch up with him to see what he has planned."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ711_01915_SEQ_06","The elder rejects Gunu Vanu's suggestion that teaching you the art of sanuwa catching is a proper offering. Of course, Gunu Vanu cannot be blamed for not knowing the intricacies of his own culture, and the elder offers to give him one last chance."
