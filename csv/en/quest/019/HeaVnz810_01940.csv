Now, he wishes you to plant these contraptions around the Makers' Quarter, so as to vex the mortal enemies of Idyllshire. Make your way to the Dravanian hinterlands, and set up the three jamming devices now."

3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ810_01940_SEQ_03","Upon hearing that the deed is done, Halfsix must stifle his own laughter when imagining exactly how frustrating it will be for the Illuminati to lose their ability to communicate. Though he does not thank you in so many words, you sense you have won the goblin's trust."
