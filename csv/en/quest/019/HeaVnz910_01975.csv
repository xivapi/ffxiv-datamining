1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ910_01975_SEQ_01","Kupli Kuki and the other moogle have resolved to go find their friend, who ran off somewhere to the eastern part of the Sea of Clouds. Meet with Kupli Kuki at Ok' Vundu Vana to join in on this terribly long game of hide-and-seek."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ910_01975_SEQ_02","Upon meeting with Kupli Kuki, he tells you that the lost moogle is nowhere in the area, but he also makes a ghastly discovery. On the ground is a kupo nut, one of the several that the moogles brought to share at their meeting in Moghome. You see the rest of the kupo nuts scattered around the area, and Kupli Kuki asks you to collect them in his stead so that he doesn't fall victim to any of the many hungry monsters stalking the area."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ910_01975_SEQ_03","You have braved the griffins and other angry beasts and gathered the precious kupo nuts. Return them to Kupli Kuki so their gift to Moghome will not go to waste."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ910_01975_SEQ_04","Kupli Kuki is glad that the kupo nuts were recovered intact, but worries for his lost friend. Aid the two moogles in their desperate search for their companion."
