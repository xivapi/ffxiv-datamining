1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ815_01945_SEQ_01","It seems the Idyllshire aetheryte may be growing unstable, and is in need of a proper inspection. However, Halfsix lacks the necessary aetherflow distributors to make his analysis. As with many things in the burgeoning settlement, it appears these, too, are located somewhere within the Arkhitekton. Thus, Halfsix bids that you make your way there and search the Illuminati pots for three of these tools."

3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ815_01945_SEQ_03","Halfsix expresses his gratitude for your service. The aetheryte will no doubt continue to spin in Idyllshire for many years to come, thanks to your efforts."
