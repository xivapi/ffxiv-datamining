1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ913_01978_SEQ_01","Everyone is excited to deepen the bonds between mooglekind, but Kupli Kuki wants to know more about the names of the Moghome moogles, in particular why every name starts with “Mog” and not something like “Kup.” Since Kupli Kuki seems to be particularly shy around moogles of high social standing, he enlists your aid in asking Chieftain Moglin the reason as to why the moogles from the sky and surface have different names. Ask Chieftain Moglin for what is sure to be a thrilling history lesson on the origins of Moghome names."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ913_01978_SEQ_02","You speak with Chieftain Moglin, and he seems eager to tell you about the names of Moghome, but not before you help the Pomguard with a pair of monsters who have suddenly attacked Moghome's kupo nut supply. Speak with Mogleo of the Pomguard to find out what aid he requires."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ913_01978_SEQ_03","Mogleo tells you that two monsters have dared to steal into Moghome's precious kupo nut supply, and asks you to aid Mogule, Kupli Kuki, and the other Twelveswood moogles in slaying the monster they have gone after. Speak with the four moogles to find out where this insatiable monster could be."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ913_01978_SEQ_04","Mogule and the other valiant Twelveswood moogles have cornered the invasive monster to the southeast. Slay it so that Moghome's nuts are in danger no more."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ913_01978_SEQ_05","You find that a stray gaelicat was one of the monsters trying to get its paws on the moogles' kupo nuts, and slay it before it can do any more harm to the precious nut orchard. Report back to Mogleo for an update on their progress."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ913_01978_SEQ_06","Mogleo and the other Pomguard members were able to take care of their target as well, and with that the kupo nuts are saved. It seems that the two monsters may have followed Kupli Kuki and the other Twelveswood moogles all the way from the Sea of Clouds. Although this crisis got everyone's pom-pom in a twist, the moogles seem to have come through it with a deeper bond, and Mogleo suggests that everyone go together to report to Chieftain Moglin of your success."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ913_01978_SEQ_07","You return to Moglin, and finally you have the opportunity to ask him about the Moghome names. While he doesn't know the exact reason that all the moogles in Moghome start with “Mog,” he informs you that the first chieftain was said to be named Moggle. Kupli Kuki fumbles around with the name for a bit before discovering that it is quite similar to Moggle Mog, and surmises that the name must have changed as the story was passed down from generation to generation in the Twelveswood. If Kupli Kuki's guess is right, then Chieftain Moglin is himself a direct descendant of Good King Moggle Mog XII, and the Pomguard are direct descendants of the Good King's household guard. Kupli Kuki is amazed that he is among such historic figures of mooglekind, although the Moghome moogles themselves do not seem very fazed at all. Mogleo finally closes this historic conversation by offering the Twelveswood moogles one kupo nut each for their previous bravery, an offer which the moogles eagerly agree to. The moogles look forward to deepening the bonds of friendship between sky and surface."
