1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ707_01911_SEQ_01","For Zundu nestlings to complete their rite of passage, they must offer the elder something of value to the tribe. Gunu Vanu's plan is to take the beak of a tsanahale, as his father once did, and prove himself a mighty warrior. Meet him deep within the Blue Window."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ707_01911_SEQ_02","In the Blue Window, Gunu Vanu states that he will keep watch while you see to the tsanahale. Lure out one of the beasts by whistling loudly and dispatch it in the usual fashion."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ707_01911_SEQ_03","The tsanahale is no more, and its beak is yours. Give it to Gunu Vanu so he may finally complete his rite of passage."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ707_01911_SEQ_04","Gunu Vanu is overjoyed to receive the tsanahale's beak and is eager to present it to the elder shaman. Accompany Gunu Vanu to the shaman's roost in Ok' Zundu."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ707_01911_SEQ_05","Though glad to receive Gunu Vanu's offering at first, the elder shaman grows skeptical that the nestling could slay a tsanahale by himself. Gunu Vanu subsequently admits to being helped by you, and the shaman commands him to redo the rite of passage─this time without attempting to exploit a loophole in the rules."
