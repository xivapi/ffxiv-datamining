To rule the skies is not enough; the Ehcatl Nine would do so in style.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 49 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA607_01568_SEQ_01","As the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> nears completion, Jezul Ahuatan finds himself more concerned about the image the Ehcatl Nine will project with their new airship. To simply soar above their earthbound brethren is not enough; they must do so in an airship both powerful and aesthetically pleasing. To this end, Jezul Ahuatan would have you meet with a brother of Ehcatl in Natalan, who has infiltrated enemy ranks and stolen the materials needed to craft high-quality decorative plating components. Venture within the Ixali stronghold and, with the chat mode in <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Say<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, enter the password “Amid the Flowers” to identify yourself as a friend.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA607_01568_SEQ_02","The Ehcatl infiltrator responds to your cryptic phrase with an equally cryptic reply of his own, before furnishing you with the decorative plating component materials you seek. Present them to Norbettaux at Camp Dragonhead in order to gain access to the crafting facility under his care."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA607_01568_SEQ_03","Norbettaux has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize two decorative plating components, and deliver them to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Finishing II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA607_01568_SEQ_04","Never let it be said that the Ehcatl Nine are lacking in passion, for upon receiving your components, Jezul Ahuatan is driven into a frenzy of Ixali pride. The Second echoes the words of his chieftain, declaring that his brethren shall soon fulfill the destiny for which they─and you─have long labored. Indeed, when the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>, that shining culmination of the Ehcatl Nine's hard work, one day takes flight, you can take pride in knowing that the obnoxious decorations which grace its hull are but one of your countless contributions."
