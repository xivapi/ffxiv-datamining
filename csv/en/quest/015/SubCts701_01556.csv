1,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_SEQ_01","Nojiro tells you of a portal in the South Shroud that has set Gridania's rumor mill to spinning. While it sounds like nothing more than a fanciful fabrication, he explains his tale comes straight from the Wood Wailers who dared to enter. As he heard it, the portal leads to a labyrinth that changes its design every time scouts enter its long-abandoned halls. Though the potential for spoils intrigues him, he finds the risk is not worth the reward. If you should be bold enough to enter, however, he bids you speak with the Wood Wailers at the mouth of Issom-Har to learn more."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_SEQ_02","You find a dutiful Wood Wailer keeping watch over the entrance to Issom-Har. He directs you to Quarrymill, where their reconnaissance team is recruiting adventurers willing to brave the depths of the ruins."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_SEQ_03","The head of the Wood Wailers' reconnaissance team explains to you their dire situation. Though they have had little success in navigating the ruins, a Padjali mage in their company has devised weaponry to aid those willing to enter. With a plan of action and equipment in hand, the Wood Wailers bid you venture into the depths of the ruins to discover what secrets lie within."

The thing is, every time they go down there to map the place out, nothing is the same. A mystery if I've ever heard one."

56,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_IRIELLE_000_040","Our excavation of the ruins has been at a standstill ever since that accursed gateway appeared. Not long after, the Wood Wailers swooped in, who then proceeded to force us out. I do not care how dangerous they say it is─our work must continue!"
57,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_ROLANDAIX_000_045","We were removed from the ruins with barely any explanation. My life's work is down there, and they are likely stamping it into the dirt even as we speak! What in the seven hells is going on?  "

64,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556_000_061","The site is of interest owing to the Gelmorran ruins─Gelmorra being an underground city which predates Gridania, in case you were unaware."
65,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_WOODWAILER00000_000_062","Anyroad, a few days past, we received reports from several anthropogeographers that a magical gateway of some sort had appeared in the ruins, and that all manner of creatures were coming and going through it."
66,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556_000_063","My men and I were among the first to examine it, and well... It's hard to explain.

It was all I could do to take even a single step."
67,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556_000_064","According to E–Una–Kotor, who accompanied us, the ruins are warded with powerful magicks that sap the spirits─and aether─of all who enter, rendering them easy prey for the creatures within."
68,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556_000_065","Thankfully, he managed to devise a solution: aetherpool arms and armor, which safeguard and channel the wielder's energies, that they might withstand the ruin's magicks."
69,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556_000_066","Unfortunately, it does little to prevent us from losing our way. Though it beggars belief, every time we have dared to venture into the ruins, we have found the path to be changed. We suspect this too may be the work of an unfathomably powerful mage..."
70,"TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556_000_067","Needless to say, something strange is afoot, and traditional tactics are not like to suffice. Even experienced adventurers will need to proceed with caution."
