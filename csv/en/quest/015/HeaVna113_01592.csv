1,"TEXT_HEAVNA113_01592_SEQ_01","Instead of listening to her expound at greater length, Lady Laniaitte would rather have you gain firsthand experience of the Vanu Vanu. To that end, she sends you to speak with Ser Marielle, who could use your assistance."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA113_01592_SEQ_02","Though Ser Marielle describes the Vanu as birdmen, she is quick to clarify that they are nothing like the Ixal. She marks several locations on your map and bids you stand watch in case the Vanu are nearby."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA113_01592_SEQ_03","As expected, you spy several Vanu during your patrol and are forced to drive them off. Report all that has transpired to Ser Marielle."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA113_01592_SEQ_04","Another day, another foiled attack by the Vanu. Ser Marielle is somewhat disappointed to learn that your patrol was not uneventful, but glad that you had no difficulty dispatching your foes."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNA113_01592_LANIAITTE_000_002","There was peace between our peoples for half a year, until suddenly, for reasons unknown, their attitudes towards us changed. They began to attack our foraging parties without provocation, forcing us to rely more heavily on supplies flown in from Ishgard."
