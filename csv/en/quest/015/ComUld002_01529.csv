1,"TEXT_COMULD002_01529_SEQ_01","The member nations of the Eorzean Alliance do not see eye to eye in all matters. Nevertheless, their disagreements have not been irreconcilable─until now. Control of the Carteneau Flats is to be decided on the field of battle, and Lieutenant Mimio would have you fight for the Immortal Flames. Speak with the Free Brigade flyer to learn more of this new conflict, and to decide if you wish to become involved."
2,"TEXT_COMULD002_01529_SEQ_02","<Emphasis>Civilized</Emphasis> violence. <Emphasis>Civilized</Emphasis> war. The concept seems contradictory, if not ludicrous, yet your fellow soldiers take no issue with this proposed resolution. It is clear now that the Immortal Flames will not be swayed from their course. You, however, are yet free to decide. To embrace this cause, or to renounce it─it is your choice."

54,"TEXT_COMULD002_01529_MIMIO_000_007","Because there <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> something there of consequence. Allagan ruins, to be precise. They were discovered following the Calamity, and Allied scholars have been studying them ever since."
55,"TEXT_COMULD002_01529_MIMIO_000_008","Three nations working in tandem for a greater good... It should come as no surprise that it would not last. You see, Ul'dah, Limsa Lominsa, and Gridania have all formally asserted a claim to the territory.

56,"TEXT_COMULD002_01529_MIMIO_000_009","Oh, but do not misunderstand! We won't be going to <Emphasis>war</Emphasis> with our allies. Hostilities shall be confined to the disputed territories, and we shall fight to submission, not death."
