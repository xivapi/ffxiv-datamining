1,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SEQ_01","The member nations of the Eorzean Alliance do not see eye to eye in all matters. Nevertheless, their disagreements have not been irreconcilable─until now. Control of the Carteneau Flats is to be decided on the field of battle, and Lieutenant Scarlet would have you fight for the Twin Adder. Speak with the Yellow Serpent flyer to learn more of this new conflict, and to decide if you wish to become involved."

The concept seems contradictory, if not ludicrous, yet your fellow soldiers take no issue with this proposed resolution. It is clear now that the Order of the Twin Adder will not be swayed from its course. You, however, are yet free to decide. To embrace this cause, or to renounce it─it is your choice."

I would prefer that this tale be heard by you and you alone. It concerns a sensitive subject with which you are doubtless well acquainted: the Battle of Carteneau."
51,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SCARLET_000_004","Aye, I speak of that bloodbath which marked the end of the Sixth Astral Era, when both the VIIth Legion and Allied forces were slaughtered by that winged abomination which did its utmost to destroy all we know and love."
52,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SCARLET_000_005","No part of Eorzea was untouched by the elder primal's rage, least of all the Carteneau Flats, which were ravaged─nay, <Emphasis>remade</Emphasis> in the fires of destruction. The Flats were rendered an accursed wasteland, and all decent smallfolk know to keep a wide berth."
53,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SCARLET_000_006","Consequently, many question why the Eorzean Alliance continues to maintain a military presence in the region, despite the personnel and materiel required to do so."

55,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SCARLET_000_008","This was an acceptable state of affairs for a time, but no longer. Ul'dah, Limsa Lominsa, and Gridania have all formally asserted a claim to the territory. A diplomatic resolution is no longer possible; the matter is to be decided on the field of battle."
56,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SCARLET_000_009","Lest you fear that this marks the advent of total war, worry not. We are allies as ever and shall conduct ourselves accordingly. All hostilities will be confined to the disputed territories, and engagements shall be fought to submission, not death."
57,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SCARLET_000_010","So you see, you needn't hesitate to join the fray. Should you have the misfortune of facing a friend in battle, you will only be expected to subdue him, not kill him."
58,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_SCARLET_000_011","Aye, that's right─I tell you all this because we need men and women of your caliber on the front line. These ruins are of vital importance to our nation's security, and we cannot surrender them to a foreign power."

64,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_KOUJATAIHIKUUHEI_000_024","It is for that reason we have established an airship route direct to the front line. Those who are ready and willing to fight will never want for transportation!"
65,"TEXT_COMGRD002_01527_KOUJATAIHIKUUHEI_000_025","Ah, but that look on your face bespeaks confusion. “Are we at war or not? What is this bollocks about no killing? What in the seven hells is going on!?” That's what you're thinking, yes?"
