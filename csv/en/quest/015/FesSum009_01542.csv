※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM009_01542_SEQ_01","Combining high-explosives disposal and crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics takes a merry heart and a steady hand. Follow J'nangho's instructions to chase flaming Bombard blanks towards a mortar full of fireworks. Whether to use the northern or the eastern venue is entirely up to you.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

3,"TEXT_FESSUM009_01542_SEQ_03","J'nangho has her own two bits to add to the inside tale of the Moonfire Faire. All this talk of energy is a happy reminder that, should you so choose, you can always return to the Zephyr Gate for another round of a Very Cherry Bomb."
