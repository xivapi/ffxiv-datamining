53,"TEXT_STMBDY992_01555_RIVALMOBHUNTER_100_002","Ah, but of course. Perhaps battle with a high-ranking Rathalos would have put a bit of sweat on your brow."
54,"TEXT_STMBDY992_01555_RIVALMOBHUNTER_101_002","Truly? I shudder to think what would have happened had you encountered a high-ranking Rathalos, then."

57,"TEXT_STMBDY992_01555_RIVALMOBHUNTER_000_005","Mayhap that kitten friend of yours knows something of it. He was, after all, the one who originally posted a bill for the beast."

Ahem. But that is neither here nor there. I asked <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> to bring you here that we might learn the truth of these high-ranking Rathalos I recently caught wind of."
