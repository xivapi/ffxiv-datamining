Or to be more accurate, <Emphasis>redeliver</Emphasis> it: the moogle who preceded you was ambushed by the Ixal, and barely escaped with his pom-pom still attached. The deputy postmoogle bids you make a second attempt: brave the Ixali gauntlet to Eugenia's Spire, and place the letter in the unyielding hands of Miah Molkot, ferocious leader of the White Rams."
2,"TEXT_SUBPST015_01575_SEQ_02","Miah scans the note, and licks her lips at the happy news within: her dear friend Philota and the lady's young grandson are to visit. But delight soon turns to alarm when she realizes that the day of their expected arrival has come and gone. Fearing the malign intervention of the Ixal, she bids you seek out her man in Treespeak, slaying any birdman you should encounter along the way."
3,"TEXT_SUBPST015_01575_SEQ_03","In Treespeak, you meet with Miah's man─a Gods' Quiver bowman who has fallen into an Ixali ambush. You swiftly defeat his attackers, but the man is still reeling from the birdman assault. Offer the injured bowman your aid."
4,"TEXT_SUBPST015_01575_SEQ_04","As you tend to the wounded archer, another Ixal leaps from the brush, swinging his axe. Just as he is about to strike, a familiar figure appears: Miah Molkot. Terrified at the fate that awaits him at the hands of the famous Black Cat, the Ixal proffers a deal: in exchange for his life, he and his comrades will find Philota and her grandson, and return them unharmed. He bids you speak with his leader by the river bend, to whom he will deliver Miah's friends."
5,"TEXT_SUBPST015_01575_SEQ_05","You make contact with the Ixali headwing, but he refuses to honor his subordinate's unauthorized pledge. Instead, he presents you with an ultimatum for the White Rams: the Ixal hold Philota and her grandson hostage, and demand to be given free rein in the Twelveswood until such time as they complete a secret objective. As proof of their word, Philota is to be released in advance, on the cliffs overlooking Fallgourd Float. Go to her, and ensure her safety."
6,"TEXT_SUBPST015_01575_SEQ_06","The Ixal spoke the truth: on the cliffside stands Philota, shaken yet unharmed. She confirms that the Ixal do indeed have her grandson in their clutches, and bids you return to Eugenia's Spire to enlist Miah's aid in the boy's rescue."

She tells you how Philota's son was the leader of the White Rams before his untimely passing, and the child held hostage is his son in turn. For the Ixal to have kidnapped the boy is an insult to the White Rams' honor, and Miah will stop at nothing until those responsible are brought to her own personal brand of justice.

Just as Miah is about to give the order to strike, a message comes from her scouts: true to their word, the Ixal have released Philota's grandson near Proud Creek. Fearing for his safety, Miah urges you to assist her men in finding the child before something more dastardly does."

He explains to you how the Ixal who held him hostage were not an invasion force, but a rescue team, hunting for a missing hatchling. Furthermore, the chieftain who released the boy left behind some strange words that seem to relate to some forgotten past. But Proud Creek is no place to linger in thought─you link up with another of the search team, who agrees to convey the boy back to the relative safety of Eugenia's Spire.

But just as the bowmen are about to depart, Philota arrives to relate a fateful tale from the past. Twenty years earlier, the White Rams, under the leadership of Philota's late son, released Ixali hatchlings to secure the safety of a young girl─a girl by the name of Miah Molkot. By the Ixali headwing's words, he could only be one of those hatchlings whose life was spared in exchange for hers. Unwilling to sever the ties of destiny put in place by her master so long before, Miah Molkot calls off the attack. And so, after twenty long years, a temporary truce returns to the Twelveswood."
