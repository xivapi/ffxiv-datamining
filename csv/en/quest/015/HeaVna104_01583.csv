1,"TEXT_HEAVNA104_01583_SEQ_01","Ser Artoirel de Fortemps, eldest son of Count Edmont de Fortemps, did not expect to have company on his mission to aid houses Durendaire and Dzemael─a prospect he was not particularly enthusiastic about in the first place, given the ancient rivalries between Ishgard's noble families. Worse, in electing to install you at his son's side, the count has given Artoirel cause to believe that his father does not trust him to carry out his duties alone. Regardless, the knight means to respect Edmont's wishes, and bids you join him at the chocobo stables in Foundation, where you will secure transport to Falcon's Nest."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNA104_01583_SEQ_04","After cursory small talk, Lord Artoirel strides off to look for Ser Redwald, who has command in Falcon's Nest. Follow the young lord and introduce yourself to the knight in charge."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA104_01583_SEQ_05","Ser Redwald recounts the tragic fate of Falcon's Nest, which was abandoned during the Ishgardian withdrawal shortly after the Calamity. Happily, it seems the time has come to reclaim what was lost, and through deeds great and small, the House Durendaire knight hopes you will help to facilitate the settlement's reconstruction."
