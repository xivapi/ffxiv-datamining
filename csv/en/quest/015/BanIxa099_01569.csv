The Ehcatl Nine manciple has a job fit for an adventurer (which most likely means fetching something).
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 1 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA099_01569_SEQ_01","The manciple has asked that you fetch something for the Ehcatl Nine which appears to be in dire need of several somethings. Speak with the warehouse foreman to learn which somethings are in demand and then set about meeting your quota.

※Earn quota points by delivering requested items. A delivery quest is complete once you have earned all the points necessary to meet your quota. Current quota status can be viewed in the duty list.

※The list of currently requested items can be viewed by speaking with the Ehcatl Nine foreman, or by opening the <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Timers<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> interface located under <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Duty<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> in the main menu.

And with that, it should not be long before you have earned the trust of the entire faction, for this day you have learned that the quickest way to an Ixal's heart is through his warehouse."
