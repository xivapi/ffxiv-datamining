Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks an exceptional Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of delicate components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 48 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA504_01512_SEQ_01","Duzal Meyean has asked you to synthesize high-quality disposal unit components, that crews may safely relieve themselves aboard the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA504_01512_SEQ_02","Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild has need of morbol vines, which will be used to craft stronger ropes for the miners who scale the mountains of Mor Dhona. Travel to the Tangle and slay a resident morbol for its feelers."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA504_01512_SEQ_03","You have obtained an exceptionally thick morbol vine. Return it to Fyrbryda before another miner snaps his neck. Also, do not forget to submit the disposal unit component materials to the forgewife for inspection."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA504_01512_SEQ_04","Fyrbryda has granted you access to the Diamond Forge's crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by Duzal Meyean and inspected by Fyrbryda to synthesize high-quality disposal unit components. Once completed, return to Ehcatl with the items.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Fyrbryda."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA504_01512_SEQ_05","You have delivered the disposal unit components to Duzal Meyean. The veteran is deeply grateful for your efforts, which will ensure that the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> is not plagued by unpleasant odors. When next you are willing to contribute to their cause, he looks forward to working with you again."
