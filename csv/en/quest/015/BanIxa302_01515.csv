Rozol Cattlan the Prudent requests the aid of a skilled Disciple of the Hand who is content with keeping <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> head down and most certainly not asking any questions.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 6 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA302_01515_SEQ_01","Moderately satisfied with your work on previous <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> components, Rozol Cattlan the Prudent wishes you to focus your efforts on crafting parts for the cockpit interior. Materials for these components have already been delivered part of the way to the Observatorium, and you need only collect them from the Ehcatl Nine carrier waiting at Skyfire Locks. Prove you are a friend of the Nine by entering the password “Now Fall” with the chat mode in <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Say<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> where the carrier can hear you. Also, speak with Roiteloin of the Locks and ask if he has any pine lumber scraps (with which to bribe Templeton, of course).

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

3,"TEXT_BANIXA302_01515_SEQ_03","Templeton is every bit as unprincipled as advertised, and now you have full access to the Highwind Skyways temporary crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by the Ehcatl Nine carrier and inspected by Templeton to synthesize two high-quality cockpit interior components, and deliver the finished products to the faction.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Production II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Templeton."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA302_01515_SEQ_04","You have delivered the cockpit interior components to Rozol Cattlan the Prudent and though he attempted to hide it, the knotcounter was visibly pleased. As construction on the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> continues, the Ehcatl Nine are coming to the realization that they may have never made it this far along if it were not for the industriousness of their featherless collaborators."
