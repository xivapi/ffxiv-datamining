1,"TEXT_COMLIM002_01528_SEQ_01","The member nations of the Eorzean Alliance do not see eye to eye in all matters. Nevertheless, their disagreements have not been irreconcilable─until now. Control of the Carteneau Flats is to be decided on the field of battle, and Lieutenant Trachraet would have you fight for the Maelstrom. Speak with the Foreign Levy flyer to learn more of this new conflict, and to decide if you wish to become involved."

The concept seems contradictory, if not ludicrous, yet your fellow soldiers take no issue with this proposed resolution. It is clear now that the Maelstrom will not be swayed from its course. You, however, are yet free to decide. To embrace this cause, or to renounce it─it is your choice."
