1,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_SEQ_01","At the Crystalline Mean, you come upon an Allagan-esque node behaving erratically. Upon inspection, the machine mutters some curious words before hovering off. You decide to keep an eye on it lest it cause trouble for civilians."
2,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_SEQ_02","After a brief pursuit, you find the node hassling a civilian who turns out to be its owner. With a well-placed slap, the woman fixes the node, which she affectionately calls Noddy, before introducing herself as Thiuna, a restorer of the Facet of Crafting and proprietor of Cherished Memories. Having explained that her focus is on items of sentimental value, Thiuna proposes a business arrangement. In order to hone her techniques, she asks you to supply the materials she needs, and you are happy to oblige. Thiuna then returns to her workshop at the Crystalline Mean and bids you join her when you are ready to begin."
3,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_SEQ_03","At her workshop, which is for now simply borrowed space, Thiuna assigns you your first task─preparing the canvas repair material for a damaged painting. When the material is ready, Thiuna will use it to restore the artwork, and in so doing restore a vision of the lost village it depicts."

71,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_024","(-Thiuna-)I'm Thiuna, a restorer of the Facet of Crafting and the proprietor of Cherished Memories.

75,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_028","(-Thiuna-)Adorable, isn't it? It's actually a relic from the tower, but it had broken down. I couldn't bear to see it lying there discarded, so I restored it as best I could. It's been with me ever since."

79,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_032","(-Thiuna-)But I'd like to propose a little business arrangement."
80,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_033","(-Thiuna-)You see, despite the work that I profess to do, I'm actually only any good at alchemy, my original field.

81,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_034","(-Thiuna-)I don't ask that you teach me─only that you craft the materials I need. By using these materials in my work, I can hone my techniques while getting the job done besides. Of course, I'll make sure you're suitably compensated."

88,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_052","So, this is Cherished Memories. Well, it is when I'm here, at any rate. I've neither the funds nor reputation to have my own place, so I'm making use of the Mean's facilities."
89,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_053","Without further ado, then, let's assign you your first task. Noddy, if you'd be so kind?"
90,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_RECORDSYSTEM_000_054","<blip> The item to be restored is a painting of Dampsole, a village in Lakeland destroyed by sin eaters approximately ninety years ago. The client is descended from the denizens of said village."
91,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_055","So, by restoring the painting, we aim to restore a vision of the village as it once was."
92,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_056","With my knowledge of alchemy, I've been able to remove the stains, but the canvas itself is in appalling condition. While the client didn't go into detail, if I didn't know better, I'd say it was intentionally damaged."
93,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_057","Now, like most paintings originating in Lakeland, this one uses a special canvas resistant to humidity. In order to restore it, we'll need a material to match. Can you prepare this for us?"
94,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_THIUNA_000_058","Thank you! Once the material is ready, I'll begin work on the restoration!"
95,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_RECORDSYSTEM_000_059","<blip> Your personal information has been updated. You are now officially an artisan of Cherished Memories. Please knock Thiuna into shape. Bish. Bash. <buzzzzzz>"
96,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_SYSTEM_000_070","Facet of Crafting Deliveries are now available. By delivering the requested items to Thiuna and raising yourself in her esteem, you can advance the story of her struggling workshop."
