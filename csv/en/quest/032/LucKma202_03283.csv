57,"TEXT_LUCKMA202_03283_EYBOR_000_015","Aye, I can hazard a guess as to where he is now, get a message to him. But you'll need somewhere quiet to meet, away from pryin' eyes..."

68,"TEXT_LUCKMA202_03283_THEVA_000_038","Ah, here's an idea... There's a common to the north where we grow our vegetables, but lately the pests have been eating more of them than we have. What do you say to a bit of extermination work?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKMA202_03283_THEVA_000_039","I want you to squash any vermin you find, then visit the caretaker and give him an earful from me for sleeping on the job. He'll be in the old silo next to the fence─snoring, like as not."

75,"TEXT_LUCKMA202_03283_SYSTEM_000_081","...No one is home, and judging by the lack of furniture, they haven't been for some time. The gnawed scraps of vegetables on the floor suggest rats have taken up residence in their absence."

78,"TEXT_LUCKMA202_03283_THEVA_000_092","...In Gatetown. Outside Eulmore? You don't have a clue what I'm talking about, do you. And there I was thinking you were another dreamer."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMA202_03283_THEVA_000_093","Well, never mind all that. Take a seat wherever you like, dear, you've more than earned it. I'll even throw in another drink, on the house."
