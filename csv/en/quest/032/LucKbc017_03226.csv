1,"TEXT_LUCKBC017_03226_SEQ_01","Mistress Nashmeira of Troupe Falsiam and her number two, Ranaa Mihgo, welcome your return to Limsa and rejoice at this fortunate reunion. After exchanging the usual pleasantries and inquiring as to your recent exploits, the Troupe Falsiam principal explains that there is a matter regarding which she would consult with you and Ranaa both, but that she wishes to do so out of the earshot of others. Follow the secretive-as-ever dancer to Summerford, where you might hear more about whatever it is she would ask of you."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBC017_03226_SEQ_02","Upon your arrival in Summerford, Mistress Nashmeira shares with you joyous tidings: to wit, Troupe Falsiam has received a special invitation to put on an exclusive performance at the Mujikoza in Kugane, the Far East's greatest venue for the performing arts. There is, however, a rub─she has promised to remain in Eorzea to repel the Totentanz, and train a new generation of dancers to continue her fight. And so she makes a startling request: she would cede the position of principal to her protégé Ranaa, and ask her to lead the troupe's expedition to the Far East. Ranaa is baffled and bewildered, as she feels entirely unready to assume a role of such responsibility. Nashmeira invites her to consider her answer carefully, then walks away, leaving Ranaa more confused than ever. Is there naught you might do to bring clarity and calm to the young dancer's mind and heart?"
3,"TEXT_LUCKBC017_03226_SEQ_03","You and Ranaa share a singularly exhilarating dance with each other, your steps in perfect synchrony. But has this served to cast out the shadow of doubt in the young dancer's heart? All that remains is to speak to her and see."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBC017_03226_SEQ_04","It would seem that sharing a dance with you was precisely what Ranaa needed to work through her conflicted emotions. The young woman's heart and mind now clear, she strides off with newfound confidence back to Limsa, where she means to inform Mistress Nashmeira of the choice she has made. After taking time to catch your breath, you set off to join her."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBC017_03226_SEQ_05","Back in Limsa, Ranaa shares her decision with Mistress Nashmeira, who is overjoyed to hear that her protégé has chosen to rise to the occasion, and thanks you for the role you played in helping the girl find her way. Ranaa departs to inform the rest of the troupe about the changing of the guard, and you and Nashmeira move along to join her."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBC017_03226_SEQ_06","Though the sudden announcement came as quite a surprise, Kuihlud and his fellow troupe members welcome Ranaa's promotion to principal, and vow to support her as she endeavors to lead Troupe Falsiam to still greater heights. Farewells and words of gratitude are exchanged by all, and both the troupe members and Nashmeira make preparations to continue their respective journeys. You say good-bye to your friends, looking forward to the day when you may once again take the stage with those who instilled in you a passion for the art of dance."
