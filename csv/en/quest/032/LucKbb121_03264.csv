1,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_01","Radovan is pleased to inform you that the Yellowjackets are in need of bodyguards. Considering the unforeseen difficulties with your previous client, an assignment with as few surprises as possible would be most welcome. To ascertain exactly what this job entails, you will need to speak with Futag Yafutag at Bulwark Hall."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_02","The Yellowjacket Futag Yafutag gives a brief outline of your mission, revealing that the person you will be protecting is Guldweitz, former head of the much reviled Flaming Mongrels. While Radovan and Sophie both have reservations about guarding a notorious criminal, Futag explains that the pirate has handed himself in and wishes to testify, implicating countless members of Limsa Lominsa's underworld. Naturally, there are many who would prefer that Guldweitz's silence be made a permanent arrangement, meaning that the assignment to escort him from the Moraby Drydocks is a particularly dangerous one. After Futag departs, Radovan points out the risks of relying solely on the information provided by the client, and suggests asking the Lominsan citizens about Guldweitz and the Flaming Mongrels."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_03","The information you glean from the locals correlates with that of your client. Guldweitz and his gang are believed to have had a hand in almost every case of extortion, with their moneylenders preying on businesses and individuals throughout the city. Many citizens would be glad to see Guldweitz behind bars or even executed for his crimes, and it is plain to see that the man has no shortage of enemies."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_04","It appears that Guldweitz is exactly as your client has described, if not worse. Satisfied that the assignment is above board, Radovan suggests proceeding to the agreed meeting place."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_05","Futag brings out Guldweitz, his prisoner, although it is hard to believe that this forlorn old man could be the criminal mastermind who has terrorized Limsa Lominsa. Before your arrival, the Yellowjackets have scouted the proposed route and have spotted what they believe to be an ambush. You are tasked with leading the way and drawing out the enemy, clearing a path for your comrades while they escort Guldweitz."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_06","Dispatching the assailants proves to be a remarkably simple affair. As instructed, you head towards Oschon's Embrace to await the arrival of Guldweitz and his custodians."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_07","Immediately after reaching the rendezvous point, another Yellowjacket arrives to report that the rogues you neutralized were only lookouts, with the real ambush awaiting further along your route. She also explains that Futag has been ordered to return to his post, while she is charged with moving Guldweitz to a more secure location until the enemies lying in wait can be eliminated. Though Futag is clearly displeased with the sudden turn of events, he reluctantly informs you, Radovan, and Sophie that your contract has been fulfilled and that your services are no longer required. Radovan, on the other hand, refuses to leave the job half-finished and chases after Guldweitz's newly assigned escort."
8,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_08","Radovan has followed the Yellowjacket to an isolated mining tunnel, and rushes inside to find that she is preparing to behead Guldweitz. She questions why Radovan is denying her vengeance for her friend's death, for which she holds Guldweitz responsible. Radovan states that he gave his word to protect him and that the prisoner is acting for the good of Limsa Lominsa. The Yellowjacket, swayed by this reasoning, lowers her axe and is placed under arrest by Futag, who arrives just in time to witness the aftermath of this unfortunate incident. Your mission, despite being severely waylaid, resumes as per your original instructions, but before you leave, Guldweitz expresses his gratitude to Radovan. After discovering that he is suffering from an incurable disease, Guldweitz came to the realization that people like him are reason why so many Lominsans are dragged into a life of crime. By removing himself and the ones he would implicate from circulation, he hopes to tip the scales in the favor of law and order. These words give you and your friends food for thought as you continue the journey to Limsa Lominsa."
9,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_09","Now that Guldweitz has been delivered to the Lominsan authorities, Radovan has fulfilled his promise. The time has come for you to travel to pastures new, and having visited Gridania, Ul'dah, and Limsa Lominsa, the most likely candidate would be the snow-blasted peaks of Ishgard, much to Sophie's obvious displeasure."
10,"TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_10","Sophie is clearly unused to such inclement conditions, and even a change into warmer attire does little to alleviate her discomfort. Radovan has, in the absence of an Adventurers' Guild, made inquiries with the Temple Knights in the hope of finding clients in need of bodyguards.

※The next gunbreaker quest will be available from Radovan upon reaching level 68."
