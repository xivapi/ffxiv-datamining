0,"TEXT_FESEST503_03204_SEQ_00","Jihli Aliapoh is like a coiled snake, ready to pounce on the next hidden egg.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST503_03204_SEQ_01","You and Jihli have succeeded in one egg hunt only to face another of Nonotta and Riggy's carefully constructed trials. This time, the map includes a baffling array of letters, almost entirely obscuring the diagram below, and the number of spriggan helpers has jumped from three to five. Whether the increased amount of information will aid or hinder your efforts remains to be seen as you set about quizzing Riggy's brethren.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST503_03204_SEQ_02","As in the previous puzzle, the spriggans each reveal a numerical clue, although keeping track of the locations of all five may prove difficult without some form of writing apparatus. While you traverse the various clearings and groves of Old Gridania, Jihli attempts to solve the mysteries concealed in the map, and her astute observations may yet be the deciding factor in locating the egg."
3,"TEXT_FESEST503_03204_SEQ_03","Now that the necessary information has all been gathered, only the task of uncovering the location of the hidden egg remains. Nonotta informs you that the password is once again “Egg Hunt,” which is a small mercy considering that every other aspect of the puzzle has become more complex in comparison to the last one. Jihli appears to be ruminating on the relationship between the numbered spriggans and the letters on the map, and should you feel the need to ask, she would be more than glad to share her thoughts on the matter."
4,"TEXT_FESEST503_03204_SEQ_04","You and Jihli successfully deduce that the one in possession of the gilded topaz egg is Gabineaux, a prominent figure among the woodsmen of the Central Shroud. Upon hearing the password, he gladly hands over the prize in question, as instructed by Nonotta and Riggy, who both arrive almost immediately after. Despite being overjoyed that you and Jihli were eventually able to locate the egg, Riggy expresses his sadness at his role of master of puzzles coming to an end. Sensing that a new purpose in life may be exactly what the young spriggan needs, Gabineaux offers him a position among his apprentice lumberjacks─a proposal that is gleefully accepted. However, he still has one last duty to perform: overseeing the conclusion of the egg hunt at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
5,"TEXT_FESEST503_03204_SEQ_05","Now that the gilded topaz egg has been presented to Nonotta and Riggy, the hunt has officially come to a close. You and Jihli are awarded the final pieces of this year's Hatching–tide costume, which the festival founder wastes no time in modeling, much to Nonotta's delight. She and Riggy have, through your efforts, proven that the conundrum they devised can indeed be solved by those with the necessary intellect and perseverance, with the next step being to allow the rest of the festival-goers to participate. Having partaken in this year's activities rather than organizing them herself, Jihli vows not to be outdone by her assistants when the next Hatching–tide arrives."
