50,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_000","You've done as I requested, and learned something of the world in which you find yourself. Now it's time I fulfilled my half of the bargain, and explained what has befallen your comrades."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_001","That is a conversation I would rather have in the privacy of my quarters, however. I must go on ahead to the tower and organize a few things, but I shall see that the guard knows to admit you."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_Q1_000_002","What will you say?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_A1_000_003","The tower's gate lies open, then?"

55,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_005","Well, yes, of course. It can be opened and closed just like any other. Does that seem strange to you?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_006","I know not how the tower functioned in your time, but I assure you there is no danger of us being locked inside."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_007","...I am not familiar with that name. Is there something I should know?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_008","An extraordinary tale. But I'm afraid I found no such individual residing in the tower when it passed into my care. Mayhap we can revisit that mystery another time. For now, I think it best that we focus on the present."

62,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_030","The Crystarium boasts a number of residential districts, but I have been informed that a room has just become available at the Pendants."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_031","Which, as it turns out, is perfect. Our path there will take us past the markets, and I was hoping to give you my own introduction to their wares. Come along."

67,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_051","When you are ready to retire, the manager will show you to your lodgings. Pray rest and recuperate, and we shall reconvene in the Ocular anon."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_052","I believe that covers all of the practical concerns..."
