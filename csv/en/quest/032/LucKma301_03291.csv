He hands you a letter of introduction, and sends you to the Amaro Launch to find a man named Cassard."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMA301_03291_SEQ_02","After reading the Exarch's missive, the merchant seems more than happy to act as your guide. You have only to give the signal to begin your trek into the desert."

※From this point onwards, you may secure passage to the lands of Amh Araeng with a word to the adroit amaro tamer."

6,"TEXT_LUCKMA301_03291_SEQ_06","A short while later, Cassard signals for a brief stop, apparently unwilling to cross the bridge before you've properly appreciated the majesty of the scene you're leaving behind."
7,"TEXT_LUCKMA301_03291_SEQ_07","You dutifully admire the imposing edifice of Qasr Sharl until your guide deems your eyes to have feasted enough─whereupon he prods you to press on with your journey."
8,"TEXT_LUCKMA301_03291_SEQ_08","Upon arriving in Mord Souq, Cassard welcomes you with obvious enthusiasm, declaring his love for the place in the same breath. Judging by the grin on the merchant's face, your visit here promises to be an interesting one..."
