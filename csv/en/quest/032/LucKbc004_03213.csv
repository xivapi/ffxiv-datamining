1,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_SEQ_01","You find Alberic trying to keep warm at the Observatorium, and he welcomes the chance to exchange stories with his former student. Upon mention of Orn Khai, the young dragon himself appears, joining the conversation and listening eagerly as you regale him with your adventures in the First. Your account of Andreia's demise brings to mind the tale of Nidhogg, as he too was driven only by memories of a time long since passed. Orn Khai expresses his profound sorrow that no one would mourn the passing of the mighty wyrm, and suggests consulting Faunehm to learn more of the fallen Nidhogg."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_SEQ_02","Faunehm answers Orn Khai's call and gladly shares her memories of her sire, Nidhogg. You learn that King Thordan had invited Ratatoskr to speak on behalf of all dragons. When he asked her to recount Nidhogg's views on mankind, she stated her beloved's thoughts on the matter, in particular that their mortal frailty made them unfit for the role of Hydaelyn's guardian. Upon hearing these words, Thordan was filled with rage and slaughtered Ratatoskr, which drove Nidhogg into madness and sparked the Dragonsong War. After concluding her account of these historic events, Faunehm advises that you commemorate him by offering a flower for which he had a particular affinity, the mist lily, at the site of his passing. Orn Khai believes that they can be found growing in Ohl Tahn and wastes not a moment in flying off to gather the elusive bloom."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_SEQ_03","The flowers you seek grow in the most unlikely of places, peeking out between the cracks of a stark rocky outcrop. Orn Khai will be pleased to hear that the search is over."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_SEQ_04","Orn Khai is delighted that you were able to find the mist lilies and is eager to offer them in memorial of Nidhogg. Since his eyes were used to summon Shinryu, which you defeated in Gyr Abania, this could be considered his final resting place."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_SEQ_05","You and Orn Khai arrive at the Royal Menagerie to pay your respects to Nidhogg. As you reflect on past encounters with the wyrm, your mind is cast back to the days spent as an Azure Dragoon, fighting alongside Estinien. Satisfied that the memory of the wyrm's memory has been honored, Orn Khai asks that you share Faunehm's tale with Alberic."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_SEQ_06","Back at the Observatorium, Alberic is intrigued to hear such a detailed account of King Thordan's betrayal. He plans to impart this newly revealed information to the Temple Knights, as he is a firm believer that matters of historical accuracy are of the utmost importance in building peaceful relations between man and dragon. Though the road ahead will not be an easy one, your friendship with Orn Khai will serve as a shining example that trust and cooperation are possible between your races, and that even former enemies need not be beholden to the past."

54,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_A1_000_200","I traveled to a world beyond our own."
55,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_A2_000_200","I laid to rest the dreaded Andreia in a land known as Norvrandt."
56,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_010","To think that such a place could truly exist!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ALBERIC_000_011","And that you have fought such terrifying foes. To fall so far from grace... 'Tis a tragic tale, if ever I heard one."
58,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_012","One similar to that of Nidhogg."
59,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ALBERIC_000_013","Aye, though nothing will ever compare to his malice. Even death could not quell his thirst for vengeance."
60,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ALBERIC_000_014","At least Andreia was not nearly so consumed by hate. I doubt not that Renda-Rae's soul is at peace."

62,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ALBERIC_000_016","I fear his soul yet lingers, doomed to wander endlessly."
63,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_017","That is too cruel a fate, even for him!"
64,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ALBERIC_000_018","I share your sentiments. For as the Azure Dragoon, I once gazed into his heart, as he gazed into mine. Such rage... Such sorrow..."
65,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_019","I will not accept this! That none should mark his passing is more than I can bear. What say you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"

68,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_A2_000_300","I, too, was an Azure Dragoon. Alberic speaks true."
69,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_025","Then we are in agreement!"
70,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_026","Though I must admit that as part of Hraesvelgr's brood, I have little knowledge of Nidhogg."
71,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_027","A deeper insight is needed if I am to properly pay my respects."

73,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ALBERIC_000_040","For better or worse, I am who I am because of Nidhogg. While others rejoiced at his death, I cannot deny that a part of myself died that day."

75,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_050","Welcome, noble dragoon. Orn Khai has explained all."

89,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_081","Only the seven great wyrms were worthy of his attention. And among them, none but Ratatoskr truly understood him."
90,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_082","Her song was beautiful indeed, and she graced both dragon and man with her wisdom."
91,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_083","She was invited by Thordan, king of men, to speak on our behalf. Ratatoskr expressed our desire to live in harmony. However, it was known that Nidhogg did not share these views."
92,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_084","When the king asked her how her brother saw mankind, she did not hide the truth. He believed that such frail creatures were incapable of protecting this star, that the task must be entrusted to the seven great wyrms alone."
93,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_085","And that is why Thordan slew her!?"
94,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_086","Ratatoskr had no intention of sowing discord, but the king could not countenance that his kind would be treated with such contempt, that we dragons would seek to claim this star as our own."
95,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_087","He turned on Ratatoskr, taking not only her eyes, but her life."

99,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_FAUNEHM_000_091","Yet there are those who would seek another path, as I once did. I turned my back on my father and his quest for vengeance."

109,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_121","It is of no matter. There is one thing that concerns me, however. In your funerary rites, the offering of flowers and such occurs at a grave or place of significance, I believe. But where should we choose for Nidhogg?"
110,"TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_ORNKHAI_000_122","Gyr Abania... Yes, that could be considered his final resting place, if that was where you fought the primal born of his eyes."
