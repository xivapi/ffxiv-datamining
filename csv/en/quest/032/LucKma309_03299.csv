51,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_A1_000_002","I've spoken with the carers."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_010","...Thank you. What you're doing, it...it means a lot to them. To me."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_WILLFORT_000_011","...Sorry to interrupt. We, uh... We realized we hadn't thanked you for rescuing Halric."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_WILLFORT_000_012","...You weren't hurt at all, were you?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_013","Hurt...? There wasn't even a fight. I was too late. Too <Emphasis>slow</Emphasis>.
And I thought I could protect you..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_CASSANA_000_014","You can't blame yourself for things beyond your control. You brought Halric back safe and sound─no one could have done any more."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_015","I'm sorry, but I've come to a decision: I won't be continuing in my role here."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_016","I hope you will forgive me for leaving you...and that you will delay Halric's last meal for as long as you possibly can."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_017","Not until it's too late, of course, just...give him what time you can."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_WILLFORT_000_018","We always do."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_019","Of course. She would have done the same."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_020","Farewell, Halric. Keep Tesleen's words close to your heart."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_CASSANA_000_021","Wait! You're leaving this very moment? I understand how you must feel, but surely this is a bit hasty? Do you even have anywhere to go?"
64,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_022","I have a destination in mind, yes. And a purpose."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_023","This damned Light, building without cease... It's the reason we can't save those corrupted by the eaters."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_024","But what if we corrected the balance? Even if it were only little by little─even if it took <Emphasis>years</Emphasis>─it would surely make things better."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_WILLFORT_000_025","Now, hold on there. Everyone knows there's too much Light, but how could you ever hope to get rid of it? You'd have to change the whole world!"
68,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_026","That's right..."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_027","We should return to the Crystarium. I may not be able to repel the eaters on my own...but I can still use the skills I have gained here to hurt them."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_WILLFORT_000_030","Poor Alisaie... She was so close to Tesleen... I only hope she doesn't do something foolish."

72,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_050","Forgive me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─I couldn't stay there a moment longer."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_051","But I was serious about what I said. While the men and women at the Inn battle against this blight with kindness, I must fight it in my own way. With steel."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"

79,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_054","Your swiftest amaro! I need to return to the Crystarium─immediately!"
80,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_CASSARD_000_055","A-As you wish!"
81,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_CASSARD_000_060","Ah, it's good to be back. Mord Souq has many charms, but there's nothing like a proper bed to recover from a long journey...as I'm sure you'd agree."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_070","Ugh, remind me to wear goggles if we ever fly over Amh Araeng again. I've barely gotten the sand out of my eyes."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_071","...But the wind did help to clear my head at least."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_072","I think I'm ready to meet with the Exarch. We need to talk about how we're going to wipe the sin eaters out. Shall we?"
85,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_MYSTERYVOICE_000_075","I see you were reunited with Alisaie, but I daresay you found little else to celebrate in Amh Araeng..."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_MALPHINAUD_000_080","Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You will have to share the tale of your journey once the two of you are suitably rested."
87,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_090","Thank you for seeking me out, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─it meant a lot to have you there at my side.
...I was tempted to set off again the moment we had decided upon a direction, but you have still to visit Alphinaud, haven't you?"
88,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_091","And if I know my brother, he'll be on the cusp of discovering something vital to our success─if he hasn't already. I'm content to stay here and consider our options for the time being─but don't keep me waiting too long, eh?"
89,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_092","Thank you for seeking me out, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─it meant a lot to have you there at my side. And looking at Alphinaud, I'd say he's as eager to begin this discussion as I am."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_093","I say we lay our experiences before the Exarch, and step back to see what kind of picture they make. Then we can decide where to go from here."
