1,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_SEQ_01","Mistress Nashmeira is pleased to announce that she has received good tidings from Ishgard─the Holy See has agreed to host a performance by Troupe Falsiam. While there are no indications that the dance of the damned has yet struck Coerthas, the troupe leader bids you be vigilant in light of the nation's war-torn past. With Nashmeira still nursing the injuries she suffered in Gridania, she bids you and Ranaa make the journey alone."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_SEQ_02","You arrive in Ishgard and meet up with Ranaa, who is having a difficult time adjusting to the colder climes, but nevertheless eagerly looking forward to the forthcoming performance. Together with your fellow rising star, you set off for the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly to pay your respects to your host Ser Handeloup, who has taken on the responsibility of organizing the show."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_SEQ_03","At the Congregation, Ser Handeloup cordially welcomes you and Ranaa to the Holy See. While he admits to feeling some initial surprise and skepticism regarding the so-called dance of the damned, he is more than happy to do what he can to aid in your efforts. It would appear Mistress Nashmeira left him strict instructions to assemble a group of particularly outspoken disgruntled citizens, in hopes that performing for them would afford you a chance to stave off the Totentanz before it can strike. You and Ranaa express your gratitude, then set off for the Gates of Judgement, where your audience awaits."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_SEQ_04","Despite being faced with your most intimidating crowd to date, Ranaa dances the Kriegstanz to perfection, drawing the aetheric manifestations of anger and hatred out from the hearts of the audience members. Stare down and chase away the shadows, that these unfortunate souls may feel a measure of hope and happiness once more."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_SEQ_05","You wield your techniques to perfection and dramatically dispel the shadows, bringing Troupe Falsiam's performance to a triumphant close. Take a moment to catch your breath and bask in your victory, then congratulate your dance partner Ranaa on a job well done."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_SEQ_06","As you and Ranaa celebrate the success of your performance, the townspeople surround you and shower you with praise for entertaining and inspiring them with your art. Likewise, the two of you express your appreciation for your admiring audience, and prepare to bid Ishgard farewell. Mistress Nashmeira awaits you in Gridania, where she is doubtless waiting to hear word of your triumph."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_SEQ_07","You return to Gridania only to find Mistress Nashmeira absent. As Kuihlud tells it, she has apparently moved on to Ala Mhigo to survey the current situation with the help of an old friend. You and Ranaa resolve to redouble your efforts in training until such time as Nashmeira summons you for your final performance.

※The next dancer quest will be available from Ranaa Mihgo upon reaching level 70."

50,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_KUIHLUD_000_005","They say the Shroud is home to many bards─minstrels who wield song and bow alike in battle. Though I have not seen their art in action, I cannot help but feel a common bond between them and our dancers."
51,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_NASHMEIRA_000_010","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Your timing is impeccable. I just received word from Ishgard─the powers that be have decided to welcome Troupe Falsiam with open arms."
52,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_NASHMEIRA_000_011","Fortunately, there are no rumors to suggest that the Totentanz has already struck in the city, or any of the surrounding regions in Coerthas."
53,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_NASHMEIRA_000_012","And yet, word has it that some of the less privileged residents of the city have grown increasingly vocal of late─not entirely unlike what we witnessed in Ul'dah. We must be vigilant."
54,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_NASHMEIRA_000_014","And so I would like to ask you and Ranaa to make for the Holy See as soon as you are able. I would join you, but I fear my wounds are not healing as quickly as I had hoped. I would only slow you down."
55,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_015","Leave it to us, Mistress Nashmeira. No matter what shadows plague the people's hearts, they'll be no match for your two favorite protégés!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_016","Come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Ishgard awaits us! Er, which way was it again?"

63,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_045","Hmm. I suppose adventurers like you get to experience all sorts of climes in your travels. Perhaps with time, I'll get used to it, too!"
64,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_050","Hah! I suppose I just need to grin and bear it, then. Oh well...once we start dancing, it should warm us up in no time!"
65,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_055","Anyhow, our first order of business is to pay our respects to our hosts. I've been told that one Ser Handeloup awaits us at a place they call the Congregation. I take it that you know the way?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_HANDELOUP_000_070","Well met, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! It is always a pleasure to welcome you back to Ishgard. Though I must say, I did not expect to see you return to us as a member of a traveling dance troupe."

Oh, but forgive me. My name is Ranaa Mihgo, and I thank you for opening the gates of your fair city to Troupe Falsiam."
68,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_HANDELOUP_000_072","The pleasure is ours. I must confess that I found the report from our friends at the Twin Adder regarding this “dance of the damned” somewhat difficult to believe. But if even a great hero like <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here would come all the way here for this purpose, I would be a fool to dismiss the threat."
69,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_HANDELOUP_000_073","And yet, I have questions. The instructions from your Mistress Nashmeira called for rounding up prominent members of the commoner class, and seating them front and center at your performance. I did not object, of course, but...whatever purpose is this meant to serve?"
70,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_074","The Totentanz is a plague that spreads from one man's heart to the next, and those whose hearts weigh heaviest with anger, fear, and unease are often the first to fall prey to its clutches."
71,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_075","If we can assemble influential members of the community and free their hearts from shadow before disaster strikes, these men and women could in turn raise the spirits of their peers. Mistress Nashmeira believes this is our best hope for curtailing the spread of the Totentanz."
72,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_HANDELOUP_000_076","Where the leaders go, so others will follow. I suppose it is as logical a course of action as any."
73,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_HANDELOUP_000_077","Very well. I have already identified suitable personages and extended to them an invitation to your performance. The venue will be before the Gates of Judgement. We believed this location would be most accessible to those who live outside the city walls."

75,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_HANDELOUP_000_090","Your audience awaits you before the Gates of Judgement─I will leave matters in your capable hands. That said, your friend─Ranaa, was it?─seems quite sensitive to the chill in the air. Perhaps she should consider donning a nice, warm coat when she's not performing?"

77,"TEXT_LUCKBB231_03253_RANAAMIHGO_000_101","We don't want to cause a panic, after all. If we can draw out and dispel the darkness before the Totentanz strikes, our task will be that much the easier. And besides, we want our audience to enjoy the show, don't we?"
