49,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_010","Alisaie has been desperate to see you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, so let's get you to her sooner rather than later!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_011","The Inn isn't too hard to find, really─you can actually see the top of the rock spires from here."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_012","We just need to swing around the ridge, then head south. Come on, I'll get my supplies together and meet you outside!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_020","All set? Oh, I should probably mention the wildlife..."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_021","While most of them will leave you be if you keep your distance, the local coyotes have learned to prey on folk heading home from the markets."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_022","I can usually swing a sword well enough to fend them off, but I may have loaded myself down with too many bargains today..."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_023","Do you think you can handle any beasts that try to make a meal of us?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_024","I thought you might. Alisaie was always saying how much y─ Um, I mean, let's get going, shall we?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_025","Speak of the curs...!"
58,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_030","Sorry, there wasn't much time to shout a warning. Were you bitten? Those things can be nasty."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_031","And yet hardly a match for you, it seems! I'd always thought Alisaie was strong, but in her mind, she was never...hmmm. Now it makes sense."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_032","Ahem, well we should push on! It might be best if you scout ahead and clear out any coyotes that have our scent."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_033","I'll wait here so you can fight without any distractions!"
62,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_035","It might save time if you could head down past the ridge and clear out any coyotes lurking nearby."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_040","Oh, thank goodness you're back. I could hear the howling and snarling from here... Frightful creatures."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_041","Let's hope the rest have seen your handiwork, and know to avoid us now. I need to get these supplies back to the Inn!"
65,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_050","This is it! Thanks to you, I didn't have to drop my shopping even once! Come to think of it, I'm glad I didn't make the trip alone..."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_051","It seems <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> ended up escorting <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>! I'll have to repay the favor somehow, but first, let's head inside, shall we?"
67,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_052","Welcome to the Inn at Journey's Head. You might be our first visitor from the Crystarium since Alisaie arrived."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_053","It's not much, but it's home for the afflicted and a handful of carers."

71,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_A1_000_002","This illness isn't contagious, is it?"
72,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_A1_000_003","I have some skill with healing..."

74,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_055","Contagious...? Well, no, not as far as we know."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_056","I'm not sure you can help in this case, but...that's good to know."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_057","I don't think I've met anyone besides Alisaie who was so unfamiliar with our situation here. Most folk have grown up knowing someone who knew someone..."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMA304_03294_TESLEEN_000_058","Hm. I might leave out something obvious, so it may be best to have Alisaie give you the full explanation."
