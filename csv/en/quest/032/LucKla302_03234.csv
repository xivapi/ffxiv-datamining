51,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_002","Physically, at least. The wounds of his heart yet remain. He sits about the stables brooding, avoiding contact with me, Knem, even the other amaro. "
52,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_003","Before there can be any deliberation on whether he remain here or be released back to the wild, I must ensure he is sound in both body <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> mind. "

54,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_005","I am loath to admit it, but you are the only one to whom Skip has shown any manner of affection...

56,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_007","Ahem. My point is, I believe he would be willing to emerge from his seclusion for you. Would you try talking to him, and see if he responds?"

72,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_026","Perhaps it has to do with the amaro's innate predisposition to magic. It is what allows them to sense the aether of others, though nowhere near as strongly as their ancestors. "
73,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_027","Indeed, so in tune were the amaro of eld with their riders they were often said to be of one mind. I can but wonder how such a pairing from an early age would influence cognitive development. Or if their breeder might─"
74,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_028","Ah, there I go getting carried away again. What was I saying? Right, Skip's predisposition to magic. Perhaps he can sense your aether more strongly than ours, thereby giving him a greater understanding of your concern for his well-being."

87,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_038","Of course, this means we must traverse through Il Mheg, home of the pixies... Do you suppose they would grant us passage? "
88,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_039","Somehow it doesn't surprise me that you've befriended them. Still, I think it would be best to err on the side of caution. "

97,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_052","I jest, I jest. Now, before we reach our final destination, we're to make a stop in Lydha Lran, yes?"
98,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_053","Fear not, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Skip is in fine health, and I have no doubt he would travel near anywhere with you at his side."

102,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_060","There you are. The pixies were quite pleased with our tribute. They've even promised we won't have to take part in any of their games. “Pixie's honor,” they said. "
103,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_BETHRIC_000_061","Not that I don't trust them, but I'd rather not stay around overlong in case they should change their minds."

114,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_AMARO03234_000_080","I sense great turmoil within his heart. He has ever loved the children of man, but now that love gives way to fear."
115,"TEXT_LUCKLA302_03234_AMARO03234_000_081","He had a companion once. Long, long ago. Together they left their home behind and traveled the world, and it was that shared love of adventure that led them here to Norvrandt, sparing them from the Flood."
