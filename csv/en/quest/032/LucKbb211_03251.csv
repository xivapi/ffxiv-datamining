1,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_01","Nashmeira informs you that Gegeruju has spoken with his friends on the Syndicate and has news he would relay to the troupe. You set out with your companions to pay visit to your patron, hoping the tidings are good."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_02","Gegeruju informs you that the groundwork has been laid for your performance in Ul'dah, where Troupe Falsiam will be the honored guests of the Syndicate itself. Though the renowned aesthete is reluctant to part with Ranaa, who he has taken quite a liking to, he grudgingly bids farewell to you and your companions. Make for the sultanate, where you might rendezvous with Nashmeira and discuss your forthcoming performance.

※In order to travel to Ul'dah, you must first complete the main scenario quest “<Switch(PlayerParameter(70))><Case(1)>The Lominsan Envoy</Case><Case(2)>The Gridanian Envoy</Case><Case(3)>The Ul'dahn Envoy</Case></Switch>.”"
3,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_03","You arrive in Ul'dah, where Nashmeira declares her intention to hold Troupe Falsiam's first performance in the impoverished shantytown of Stonesthrow. No sooner than you arrive are you approached by a member of the Brass Blades, who orders you to abandon the plans for your performance on account of recent rioting in the area. After some argument, the man reluctantly agrees to let you try your hand at tracking down the individuals behind the disturbance and resolving the matter yourself."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_04","Explicitly disobeying Nashmeira's advice, Ranaa insists that you and she split up to conduct your investigation. Question the townspeople and see what you might glean regarding the individual behind the recent unrest."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_05","Your questioning of the townspeople has garnered you some vague information, but little in the way of conclusive evidence. Reunite with Ranaa and see if your partner has not had better luck."

7,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_07","You come upon Ranaa being harassed by none other than the men behind the recent riots, but─thanks in no small part to your newfound dancing skills─you are able to make short work of the ruffians. Safe for now, you decide to check on your fellow dancer's well-being."
8,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_08","Ranaa, deeply disappointed in herself but physically no worse for the wear, shares with you a curious tale about her capture. Apparently, her would-be kidnappers suddenly began to perform a dance most bizarre before turning on her and attacking. She states her intention to report this disturbing incident to the Brass Blades, and asks that you return to Nashmeira and apologize on her behalf in the meantime."
9,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_SEQ_09","With all members of her troupe safely reunited, Nashmeira proceeds to sternly rebuke Ranaa for letting her overconfidence get the better of her. She expresses her curiosity about the strange dance her protégé claims to have witnessed, but trails off before pursuing the subject further. In the end, she states that Ranaa will be performing on her own for a while as a punishment, and encourages you to continue to hone your own dancing skills until it is time to take to the road once more.

※The next dancer quest will be available from Nashmeira upon reaching level 65."

123,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_249","Ranaa, you disappoint me. It is not a lack of dancing prowess that led to your failure today. No, it was the overconfidence that led you to stray from your partner's side."
124,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_250","When Troupe Falsiam dances, we dance as one. We dance to stir hearts and lift spirits, not merely to show off our skills, that our admirers might shower us with empty praise. I thought you understood this, but it is clear you still have much to learn."
125,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_RANAAMIHGO_000_251","I...I am sorry, Mistress Nashmeira. I promise I will not repeat my mistake."
126,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_252","Forgive me for making you suffer the girl's foolishness, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Though she has grown in skill, it is clear she is still a child in more ways than one. I can only hope that she will take today's lesson to heart, lest she eventually pay the price."
127,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_Q1_000_100","What will you say?"
128,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_A1_000_100","Is that not going a bit too far?"
129,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_A2_000_100","You ask much of the girl."
130,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_255","Being a true dancer is about more than knowing how to move one's feet. I must be tougher on Ranaa than anyone, lest Troupe Falsiam fail to carry out its sworn duty."
131,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_256","I can see you are confused by my words. Do not worry. All will become evident in due time. Yes, both you and Ranaa will understand all too well..."
132,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_257","And with that, I must prepare for our forthcoming performance. This time, I will be asking Ranaa to take the stage alone. She may consider it her opportunity to reflect upon her actions today, and─gods willing─learn and grow from her missteps."
133,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_258","Meanwhile, perhaps it would be best if you, too, returned to your training. If you and Ranaa truly mean to bring out the best in one another, both of you will need work harder than ever before. Farewell for now, and let us meet up again when it is time to move on."
134,"TEXT_LUCKBB211_03251_NASHMEIRA_000_260","And now...I do believe it's time I did some investigating of my own."
