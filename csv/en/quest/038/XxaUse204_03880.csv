0,"TEXT_XXAUSE204_03880_SEQ_00","Raubahn would like to discuss how to handle the Doman refugees."
1,"TEXT_XXAUSE204_03880_SEQ_01","Regardless of the Syndicate's decision, Raubahn is not content to ignore the Domans' plight. He bids you and the others accompany him to the Hall of Flames to discuss what options remain available."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE204_03880_SEQ_02","Concluding that the other city–states are unlike to accept the refugees, Alphinaud proffers an alternative solution. Rather than petitioning another nation for aid, the Domans might instead travel to the outpost of Revenant's Toll, where they could work as frontier hands in exchange for food and shelter. Though Yugiri is amenable to the idea, the matter of how the refugees would make a journey of so great a distance remains. Believing that the Ul'dahn Adventurers' Guild may be of assistance, Alphinaud departs for the Quicksand and invites you to follow."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSE204_03880_SEQ_03","Momodi has agreed to provide temporary accommodations for the Domans, so that they might regain their strength before embarking on their journey. Alphinaud bids you rest your own legs for a moment, then return to Vesper Bay to meet your guests and escort them to the place they will sojourn."
