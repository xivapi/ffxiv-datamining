50,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_UTERLMATL_000_010","Greetings, my good <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>! I take it you are here at Qhoterl Pasol's request, yes? The truth is, we have uncovered a rather bizarre artifact in the deeper levels of the cavern. An urn, but one like no other."
51,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_UTERLMATL_000_011","For inside was, for want of a more grandiose word, a whistle. Or perhaps it was a flute... Whatever it is, one brave soul took it and played a brief melody, and a moment later, something appeared within the otherwise empty vessel: the great serpent itself!"
52,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_UTERLMATL_000_012","Why, I could hardly believe my eyes, but what happened next was perhaps even more miraculous. Our divine visitor did release a heavenly light, and those who did receive of this blessing were as Qitari reborn, filled with vigor! Now, listen carefully..."

I trust you are ready to continue efforts to invigorate our workforce?"
54,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_UTERLMATL_000_014","By using the sacred whistle, you are to guide the great serpent to my fellows and grace them with its mystical light. I shall be praying for your success, my most esteemed and gracious comrade!"

57,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_VAGUEQITARI_000_021","Blessing of the great serpent itself, eh? Can't say I've done much to deserve it, but I'll take it all the same. Praise be!"

63,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_QHOTERLPASOL_000_031","As for the questions surrounding our divine benefactor and the reasons for its involvement, the great serpent moves in mysterious ways. Sometimes, it'll wiggle. Other times, it'll bob up and down and let out a mighty “scree!” Yes, we are truly blessed."
