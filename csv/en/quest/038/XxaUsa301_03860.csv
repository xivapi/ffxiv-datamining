1,"TEXT_XXAUSA301_03860_SEQ_01","A Qiqirn and former employee of Buscarron's Druthers forgot some of his personal effects upon leaving. Go speak to Baensyng on Hawkers' Alley in Limsa Lominsa to learn where you might find said Qiqirn."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSA301_03860_SEQ_02","You learn from Baensyng that a Qiqirn merchant on Hawkers' Alley named Kyokyoroon may know something of Teteroon's whereabouts. Bring the trader a fresh chicken egg to coax him into spilling the goods."
