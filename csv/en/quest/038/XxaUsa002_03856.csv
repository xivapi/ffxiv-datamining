1,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_SEQ_01","Vorsaile Heuloix would have you communicate directly with the sylphs and ascertain their true intentions regarding the primal Ramuh. To avoid any cross-cultural misunderstandings, you are to first travel to the Hawthorne Hut and receive a briefing on sylphic culture with the officer stationed there. Speak to Mitainie outside Westshore Pier in Old Gridania to see about transportation."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_SEQ_02","Mitainie has instructed you to take the ferry from Westshore Pier to reach the East Shroud. Once there, you will only need to head due east to find the Hawthorne Hut, where you will find Amelain of the Twin Adder."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_SEQ_03","Amelain has informed you that Rolfe Hawthorne is well versed in sylphic culture and should hold the answers you seek."

54,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_005","Aye, your little bird sings true. No doubt you've heard that we're investigating the sylphs─that curious beast tribe that calls the depths of the Twelveswood home."
55,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_006","The sylphs are, for the most part, a peaceable bunch─much to the delight of the Elder Seedseer, who has no desire to see her people embroiled in yet another fruitless war."
56,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_007","The Twin Adder is of the same mind, and 'tis precisely for this reason that the sylphs' relation to the primal Ramuh has raised a flag of warning amongst our ranks."

58,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_009","Should there be even a sliver of a chance that the summoning of the primal might disturb the balance between Gridania and the sylphic tribes, it is a possibility we cannot ignore."

62,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_013","I would hear from the other side─the sylphs themselves─and seek an impartial party to serve as my liaison. That is where you Scions come in."
63,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_014","The sylphs of Little Solace remain untempered, and have held many a productive dialogue with our people. I would hear their candid thoughts on their tempered brethren."
64,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_015","That said, I urge you to exercise due caution. Sylphic tradition and etiquette bear little resemblance to our own. It would not do to have any cross-cultural <Emphasis>faux pas</Emphasis> get in the way of a productive parley."
