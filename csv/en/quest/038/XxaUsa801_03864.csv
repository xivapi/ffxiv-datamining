2,"TEXT_XXAUSA801_03864_SEQ_02","You have culled three ziz as suggested, and have little to show for it besides a rich crop of bites and gashes. Return to Fallgourd Float and report to Aideen."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSA801_03864_SEQ_03","Aideen strikes ziz from her list of suspects, and turns her attention once more towards the masked man and his winged eyeball."
