1,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_SEQ_01","Evidence suggests that whoever stole the Book of Thal means to avail himself of the secrets within, leading Lalai to conclude that the thief is a black mage. She speculates that the individual may have attempted to make contact with other black mages, namely your three beastman friends. Proceed to Burgundy Falls in eastern Thanalan and ask Kazagg Chah whether he has had any unusual guests of late."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_SEQ_02","Kazagg Chah tells you that he was very recently attacked by a robed man who wielded black magic. Could this be the individual you seek? According to the Amalj'aa, the attacker will not have gotten far. Search for him in the surrounding area."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_SEQ_03","You have found a robed man, but he vehemently denies being the one who attacked Kazagg Chah. He suggests that you both pay the Amalj'aa a visit in order to clear up the matter."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_SEQ_04","A glance is enough for Kazagg Chah to confirm that the robed man is not his assailant. Introducing himself as Zhai'a Nelhah, a Hearer of Gridania, he informs you that the Seedseer Council has sent him to find a certain black mage. Upon hearing of the Book of Thal, Zhai'a Nelhah believes that he may learn something useful from Lalai, and decides to pay her a visit. Return to Milvaneth Sacrarium in Ul'dah and be present for the meeting."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_SEQ_05","In fretful tones, Zhai'a Nelhah explains that the man he is hunting, Waldeve, leads a cult of nefarious black mages. Waldeve was once a conjurer of Stillglade Fane, but he forsook the art of healing in order to sate his hunger for power. It seems clear that he is the thief who stole the Book of Thal, and with it seeks to unleash unspeakable destruction. Though their ideologies are completely at odds, in order to avert disaster, Zhai'a Nelhah and Lalai resign themselves to working with one another. After the Hearer takes his leave, Lalai teaches you a new spell─Ley Lines─which she deciphered from the Book of Nald. She bids you apply yourself to mastering the spell, and promises to let you know if there are any developments.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 54."

49,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_LALAI_000_001","In my search for the Book of Thal, I have drawn upon all my resources in the trading spheres. The tome has not appeared on the black market, nor has it found its way to a private collection."
50,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_LALAI_000_002","This tells us that the thief has made no effort to sell it. If we consider, then, the fact that he was able to open a magically sealed chest, we may safely assume that the suspect is a mage, and his interest in the tome is personal."
51,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_LALAI_000_003","However this individual came to know the existence of black magic, it seems plain he seeks to unlock the tome's secrets. To what end, it is too early to say, but at the very least we now have a lead."
52,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_LALAI_000_004","There are scarce few who share our knowledge of black magic: your three beastman friends who were present when Master Ququruka rendered up his last breath. It may be that the thief's identity is known to one of them."

57,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_KAZAGGCHAH_000_011","Not a bell ago, a robed man appeared before me. “Join me,” he said, “and together we shall master the dark arts!” A dubious offer, which I naturally declined. But no sooner had the words left my mouth than he unleashed a barrage of spells at me!"

93,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_ZHAIANELHAH_000_109","I am afraid so. It is no coincidence that the tome went missing at the same juncture the man reappeared. Even now, he continues instructing his minions in black magic, and every day that passes sees the cult grow into a bigger threat. If we are to move against them, we must do so now."
94,"TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_LALAI_000_110","I had assumed that we were dealing with a lone mage. But if it is an entire cult as you say, I will need to reconsider my plans."
