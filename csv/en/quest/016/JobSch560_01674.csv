1,"TEXT_JOBSCH560_01674_SEQ_01","Surito Carito reveals his latest theory: the voidsent bound within the amphora unleashed the sickness upon Nym, and fled from its cage after cloaking itself with dark magicks. He says you must track down this invisible voidsent, but that even a scholar of his experience needs time to discover where to start. In the meantime, he asks that you and Alka Zolka focus on training, and introduces Halga Tolga to guide you. Speak with this former officer of the vaunted Nymian Royal Marines near Bronze Lake, and start learning things the hard way."
2,"TEXT_JOBSCH560_01674_SEQ_02","After dressing you down, Halga Tolga demands you show your commitment to the Royal Marines.

4,"TEXT_JOBSCH560_01674_SEQ_04","Grudgingly, Halga Tolga admits you have the spirit of a Royal Marine. Now, he bids you prove that you have the courage of one by finding the leader of the Mamool Ja to the east of Bronze Lake. Mock him and his ways with a great big /laugh, and defend yourself if he should take exception to your actions."
5,"TEXT_JOBSCH560_01674_SEQ_05","You have outraged and defeated a band of Mamool Ja. Report back to Halga Tolga near the Wanderer's Palace for your debriefing."
6,"TEXT_JOBSCH560_01674_SEQ_06","Though not overly impressed by either Alka Zolka or you, Halga Tolga concedes that you show promise. However, he is abundantly clear that you have a long way to go. Focus on honing your own skills, he orders you, and you may be able to defeat the invisible voidsent. Someday.

※The next scholar quest will be available from Surito Carito upon reaching level 58."

52,"TEXT_JOBSCH560_01674_SURITOCARITO_000_004","That is what I have come to believe. As to why it fled, I can only suppose the long years bound within the vase robbed it of the strength to oppose you."
