With your lances joined, you succeed in vanquishing the dragon that for so long had tormented the people of Ishgard. Turn your attention now to your comrade, who continues to wage a battle within herself."
6,"TEXT_JOBDRG600_01695_SEQ_06","You bear witness to a touching reunion between Heustienne and her father, Montorgains. Bolstered by his words, she vows to conquer the lure of dragon blood, that she might one day return to Ishgard. Till that day, she will roam the land and fight dragons with their own power. And till next you meet her, continue serving the realm as the best Azure Dragoon you can be.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"
