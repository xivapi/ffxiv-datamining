1,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_01","Estinien is forced to concede that Cid's expertise may be your only hope of breaking through the Aery's tempestuous barrier. While the Azure Dragoon keeps vigil over Nidhogg's lair, you are to enlist your old friend's aid. Make your way back to Ishgard, and rendezvous with Alphinaud at Saint Reinette's Forum."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_02","You arrive back in Ishgard to find Alphinaud pondering how best to locate the Ironworks' ever-industrious master. Recalling Lord Emmanellain's fondness for gossip, he suggests paying a visit to Fortemps Manor. Make your way to the Pillars, and speak with the young lord."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_03","Lord Emmanellain is only too happy to furnish you with the latest gossip surrounding Cid and the Holy See's ill-fated airship. Make your way to Ishgard's airship landing and seek out your old friend."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_04","You locate Cid at the airship landing, and Alphinaud wastes no time describing your predicament. Wary of pitting the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> against foes as agile as the Dravanians, however, Cid suggests you take a look at his employees' latest project. Head over to the Skysteel Manufactory and speak with Biggs."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_05","Biggs and Wedge proudly display their newest invention─a diminutive airship known as a “manacutter.” As they set about explaining the craft's various advantages and disadvantages, however, the door bursts open to admit a panting Tataru. The receptionist has news of the sultana! Noting the urgency of the situation, Cid bids you concentrate on matters in Ul'dah while he and his engineers continue work on the manacutter."

51,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_ESTINIEN_000_004","And steal all the glory for myself, you mean? Nay, I am not so selfish as that. Contact me by linkpearl when your preparations are complete, and we shall set forth from Ishgard together."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_ALPHINAUD_000_005","I suggest we rendezvous back at Saint Reinette's Forum, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. From what I gleaned of the Holy See's decidedly <Emphasis>ambitious</Emphasis> airship project, Cid will still be in Ishgard."

55,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_ALPHINAUD_000_010","When last you saw Master Garlond, he was advising the Ishgardians on their ailing airship, correct? In that case, he might still be at Camp Cloudtop. Failing that, we could try the airship landing, or mayhap even the Skysteel Manufactory... But let us not waste time searching aimlessly. Someone in the city is sure to know where to find him. The question is who? Ser Aymeric would seem the obvious choice, but there is no guaranteeing he will be able to grant us an audience at short notice..."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_ALPHINAUD_000_011","Ah, I have it! Count Edmont's youngest son prides himself on knowing all of the Holy See's juiciest rumors. Let us return to the manor and see if Lord Emmanellain is about."

69,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_033","Hm. The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> could certainly take you where you need to go...but she would not fare well against dragons. She's agile for a ship her size─but not <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> agile. The Dravanians would fly rings around her."

77,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_ALPHINAUD_000_040","Ah, yes─the Skysteel Manufactory. As I recall, this workshop is primarily devoted to the construction of dragon-slaying weapons..."
78,"TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_041","The Ishgardians have granted us the use of a small corner of their workshop─all part of the agreement. I think you'll see we've made the most of the space..."
