1,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_01","After a moment's reflection, Matoya deciphers the contents of the tome, that Cid might avail himself of her research and build the aetheric ram. However, the question of an energy source remains. Even as you mull over the dilemma, Alphinaud has an epiphany: the Eye is a boundless source of aether! ...But will Estinien relinquish it? Ask Alphinaud how he means to proceed."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_02","Alphinaud intends to consult Ser Aymeric on the possibility of borrowing the Eye. Make your way back to Ishgard, and speak with the lord commander at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_03","Aymeric agrees to speak with Estinien on the matter of the Eye. While he does so, seek out Cid at the airship landing and share with him the knowledge of the aetheric converger."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_04","With the knowledge to build the aetheric ram finally at his disposal, and a suitable energy source secured, Cid sets to work with obvious relish."

51,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_YSHTOLA_000_004","'Tis well that you were able to retrieve the tome. Had you failed, Master Matoya planned to have us take dictation while she quoted its contents from memory."

55,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_YSHTOLA_000_012","My lord. Pray excuse me for forgoing due pleasantries, but we seek your counsel regarding the aetheric ram. Though we now possess the knowledge to build such a device, we yet lack an appropriate source of energy with which to power it. We believe, however, that Ishgard may possess the solution to our problem."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_AYMERIC_000_013","You need not apologize, my lady. Full eager am I to learn of your progress. Please, tell me of this energy source that you believe we possess."

67,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_YSHTOLA_000_022","This tome contains the fruits of my former master's research on a device known as an aetheric converger. Our ram should operate on the selfsame principle."

...But there will be time for tearful reunions later. I'll make a start on the tome right away. So long as I have a grasp of the fundamentals, I should be able to knock something together. Which leaves the small matter of the energy source..."
