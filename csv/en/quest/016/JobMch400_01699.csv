1,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_SEQ_01","Stephanivien is excited to share with you the completion of his latest invention, but his enthusiasm is soon dampened by the arrival of his father. It would seem that Svara, a dragon of great size and ferocity, is en route to Skyfire Locks─a collection of redoubts that House Haillenarte is honor-bound to defend. In response to Lord Baurendouin's dire need for reinforcements, Stephanivien pledges the participation of the manufactory's machinists. Speak with the chief machinist and discuss what is to be done."
2,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_SEQ_02","With the majority of his machinists untested in battle, Stephanivien decides to entrust the use of his prototype to you. He asks that you employ the autoturret in the defense of Skyfire Locks, and demonstrate to Lord Baurendouin the full extent of machinistry's effectiveness."

49,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_STEPHANIVIEN_000_001","'Tis unfortunate that many Ishgardians cannot appreciate the practicality of my work. People such as my father, for instance..."

51,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_BAURENDOUIN_000_003","Never should I have allowed you to set foot inside this workshop! Had I but known that the curiosity you displayed as a boy would develop into this all-consuming distraction..."

68,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_STEPHANIVIEN_000_020","Oh dear. I fear I have allowed my passions to impair my better judgment─of all my budding machinists, only you have seen true combat."
69,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_STEPHANIVIEN_000_021","'Tis to you, then, that I would entrust the use of my prototype device. The “rook,” as I have taken to calling it, is an autoturret─a type of machinist weapon that fights on its own!"
70,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_STEPHANIVIEN_000_022","Do you recall Rostnsthal's explanation of the aetherotransformer? That contraption at your waist will convert your body's aether into the lightning-aspected energy required to power the turret. You need simply to activate the weapon, and it will supplement your own attacks."
