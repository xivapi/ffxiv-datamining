1,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_SEQ_01","According to Y'shtola, Matoya has been living as a hermit on the fringes of Sharlayan, in the Dravanian hinterlands. The journey will take you west through the Dravanian forelands. In order to prepare, Alphinaud suggests that you first return to Ishgard. Make your way back to the Holy See, and rejoin your comrades at the aetheryte plaza."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_SEQ_02","It is decided that you and Alphinaud will accompany Y'shtola on the expedition to Sharlayan. The first leg of your journey will take you to the settlement of Tailfeather."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_YSHTOLA_000_002","When the Garlean Empire first marched upon Eorzea some fifteen years ago, the denizens of Sharlayan were summoned back to the motherland."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_YSHTOLA_000_003","However, Matoya refused to join the exodus. To this day, she lives a hermit's life on the fringes of the abandoned city."

54,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_YSHTOLA_000_006","Oh, so it's to be a homecoming, then? As fine a reason as any to go to Sharlayan, and it would afford us the opportunity to pay my master a visit."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_ALPHINAUD_000_007","Ahem. I believe you have mistaken our primary objective, Y'shtola. At any rate, the journey will take us through largely unknown territory. Let us first return to Ishgard and make our preparations."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_TATARU_000_010","Tee hee! Y'shtola looks absolutely smashing in her new outfit, don't you think?"

68,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_YSHTOLA_000_021","But rest assured my strength is returning to me. I shall be back to my former self ere long."
