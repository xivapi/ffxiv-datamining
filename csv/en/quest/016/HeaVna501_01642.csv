1,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_SEQ_01","According to Lucia, the <Emphasis>Soleil</Emphasis>, the archbishop's personal airship, was recently sighted in the Sea of Clouds. Unfortunately, the airship was bound for the northern reaches, which are not easily accessible from Camp Cloudtop. In order to pursue the Heavens' Ward, you and Alphinaud will need to enlist the aid of a bold airship captain─and Alphinaud knows the perfect candidate for the job."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_SEQ_02","Cid's cheery demeanor soon darkens when he learns of Lord Haurchefant's death and the archbishop's escape. Though he can offer no insight into the meaning of “Azys Lla,” he surmises that it is the source of some phenomenal cosmic power which Thordan VII covets. Recognizing the gravity of the threat, he agrees to help, and bids you join him at the airship landing when you are ready to depart."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_LUCIA_000_001","Sure enough, Lady Laniaitte informed me that it had been sighted by her scouts."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_ALPHINAUD_000_002","Then the archbishop is somewhere in the Sea of Clouds?"
51,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_LUCIA_000_003","Or <Emphasis>was</Emphasis>, not long ago. The airship has not been seen since it disappeared into the northern reaches near the Blue Window."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_LUCIA_000_004","Alas, because the region is firmly held by the Vanu Vanu and not easily accessible from Camp Cloudtop, House Haillenarte has yet to establish a foothold. We will need not only an airship, but a captain bold enough to risk the beastmen's wrath."
53,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_ALPHINAUD_000_005","I think we both know the perfect candidate, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Let us pay a visit to Master Garlond at the Skysteel Manufactory."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_LUCIA_000_006","I see... Then I will take my leave for now. There are other matters which require my attention."

56,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_ALPHINAUD_000_008","Who else but Master Garlond would be willing to deliver us into Vanu territory? I say we go and ask him first."

61,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_ALPHINAUD_000_013","Cid, have you ever heard of “Azys Lla”? The archbishop spoke of it before he fled."
62,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_014","No, but it's probably some source of phenomenal cosmic power that's key to his plans."
63,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_015","From what he told <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, the Ascians tried to tempt him as they tempted Gaius with the Ultima Weapon. Even if he spoke true about playing along, I can see him attempting to seize it."
64,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_ALPHINAUD_000_016","As if we needed another reason to pursue him..."
65,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_017","Well, I'm convinced. The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is at your disposal. Come to the airship landing when you're ready to depart."
66,"TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_018","Heh, it's just as well. After pulling you <Emphasis>out</Emphasis> of the fire these last few times, I reckoned I was due to deliver you into it."
