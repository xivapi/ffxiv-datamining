1,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SEQ_01","Surito Carito reveals that he and Alka Zolka have located the grand keystone, the means to again sealing away the afflicted tonberries. In fact, Alka Zolka has already ventured forth to search for it among the ruins to the east. However, ancient guardians watching over Nymian assets may pose a threat to your marauder friend. Go now, and ensure his safety."
2,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SEQ_02","Alka Zolka has eagerly awaited your coming. Take the grand keystone from where it lies, and together face whatever rises to defend it."
3,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SEQ_03","The guardian destroyed, you now have the grand keystone in hand. Present it to Surito Carito near the Wanderer's Palace."
4,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SEQ_04","Surito takes the grand keystone with thanks. Though sealing his ailing friends away will not save them, it will give the scholar enough time to devise a cure.

※The next scholar quest will be available from Surito Carito upon reaching level 54."

49,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SURITOCARITO_000_001","The credit for the find truly lies with Alka Zolka. His knowledge of Nym is impressive. It was not long into our discussion of the stone's whereabouts that we were able to piece together where it must be."
50,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SURITOCARITO_000_002","As you can imagine, he could not contain his curiosity. Even now, he is combing through the ruins. Please, see that he comes to no harm."
51,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SURITOCARITO_000_003","We often left guardians to watch our most precious assets. I told Alka Zolka this, but he firmly believes the enchantments have worn thin. I am less sure. Be careful when you take the grand keystone."
