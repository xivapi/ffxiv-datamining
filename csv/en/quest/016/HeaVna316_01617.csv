1,"TEXT_HEAVNA316_01617_SEQ_01","Alphinaud is eager to begin the ascent of Sohm Al. Return to Anyx Trine in the Dravanian forelands, and report your victory over the Gnath's god to Vidofnir."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA316_01617_SEQ_02","Vidofnir listens in disbelief as Ysayle relates the circumstances of Lord Ravana's defeat. True to her word, the dragon vows that she will open the way to Sohm Al...once you have negotiated the cavern of Mourn. Climb the central tower of Anyx Trine to the second floor, then fight your way through Mourn's denizens to join Vidofnir on the threshold of the path to the summit."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA316_01617_SEQ_03","After battling your way through the cavern of Mourn, Vidofnir opens the path forward, as promised. Before taking her leave, however, the dragon warns that you will not be welcome in the domain beyond. Prepare to face the mightiest of Nidhogg's minions, on your way to the summit of Sohm Al.

※Challenge Sohm Al with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point."

Soon after the dragon's death, however, Estinien is overwhelmed by Nidhogg's feelings of rage and anguish─an unwelcome reminder of the connection he shares with the great wyrm. Put any doubts you may feel to one side, and continue your journey into the Churning Mists."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA316_01617_SEQ_05","You have arrived at the summit of Sohm Al. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on finally having reached the mountain's lofty peak."

57,"TEXT_HEAVNA316_01617_ICEHEART_000_012","In his overconfidence, the primal swore to withdraw his followers from your lands in the event of his defeat─a promise we believe he will keep. The Gnath shall trouble you no longer."
