It would seem that the forgetful artist has likely left his masterpiece out on Sohm Al's summit, and that the stone is in danger of being claimed by an enthusiastic devotee of his work. Return to Mogwin, and share the information you have learned."

Setting you upon the second half of your trial, the forgetful artist bids you rush outside and retrieve it before some art-starved admirer pockets the pebble for his own. Head out to the Sohm Al summit, and search for Mogwin's masterpiece."

Gleeful at the thought of the kupo nuts he will receive in exchange for his work, the trial-giver promises to sing your praises to Chieftain Moglin."
