1,"TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_SEQ_01","Alphinaud has called a meeting to discuss how Azys Lla's defenses might be breached. Proceed to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, and speak with the guardsman within to be admitted to the Seat of the Lord Commander."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_SEQ_02","Cid believes that it may be possible to pierce the barrier surrounding Azys Lla by mounting a ram of condensed aether on the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. There is just one problem: he has not the faintest idea how to make one. Apparently, designing such a device would require the expertise of a true authority in the field─an authority such as an Archon. Even as Alphinaud laments their absence, Edmont recalls a discussion he had with Tataru, wherein she claimed to have acquired a clue pointing to the whereabouts of one of your missing comrades. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and trouble her for the particulars."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_SEQ_03","Tataru confirms that she has made progress in the search for the Archons. Hearing this, you cannot help but smile. With your lost friends at your side, surely nothing will prevent you from reaching Azys Lla."
