1,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_SEQ_01","Tataru reveals that shortly after General Raubahn's reinstatement, she asked Marshal Tarupin to conduct a search of the watercourse beneath Ul'dah─the place you last saw Minfilia, Thancred, and Y'shtola. Pipin now sends word of a discovery, and asks that you come to the Hall of Flames."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_SEQ_02","At the Hall of Flames, Pipin produces Y'shtola's wand, retrieved from the rubble of the collapsed watercourse. Upon close inspection, Urianger divines that Y'shtola invoked a forbidden teleportation magick and was sent to an unknown location. In order to find her, you must follow the trail of her passage through the Lifestream, starting from the spot the spell was cast. Join Urianger at the Sil'dih excavation site, that you may begin the search."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_SEQ_03","According to Urianger, Y'shtola's trail leads to the Twelveswood, where she likely remains adrift in the Lifestream. He adds that no soul can survive for long in the midst of its restless currents. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Alphinaud resolves to petition the aid of the Elder Seedseer. Make haste to Gridania, and join Alphinaud at Nophica's Altar."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_SEQ_04","According to Alphinaud, only the elementals will be able to find Y'shtola within the Lifestream. And only their chosen people, the Padjal, will be able to ask this of them."

62,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_PIPPIN_000_013","Yes, of course. As per your request, I had my men scour the waterways. Almost immediately, we encountered a difficulty: an entire section of the tunnel had collapsed."

69,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_URIANGER_000_020","'Tis as I did surmise. Judging by the aetheric imprint that lingereth yet upon this wand, it hath assuredly been employed in the casting of a most uncommon magick."
70,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_ALPHINAUD_000_021","Namely?"
71,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_URIANGER_000_022","The very first that man did conceive to traverse great distances, and the ancient precursor to all methods of travel that utilize the Lifestream: <Emphasis>Flow</Emphasis>."
72,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_URIANGER_000_023","The spell entaileth the reduction of the corporeal form into its constituent aether, that the caster might enter the Lifestream, and ride its currents thereby. Unlike the teleportation magicks of modern times, it requireth not a lengthy incantation. That Y'shtola should choose to employ such a spell bespeaketh the need for haste."
73,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_ALPHINAUD_000_024","All of which would suggest she managed to escape!"
74,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_URIANGER_000_025","Would that it were so simple. Know that the scholars of Sharlayan forbade the use of this spell─and with good reason."
75,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_URIANGER_000_026","The caster hath but limited control over his course. For every mage who came safe unto his destination, another would be set adrift in the Lifestream, never to emerge."

88,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_ALPHINAUD_000_045","And yet the Gridanians have reported no sightings. We must take this to mean she is still adrift."
89,"TEXT_HEAVNA602_01651_URIANGER_000_046","If it be so, I do fear for our friend. Contrary to its name, the Lifestream is more akin to a raging torrent. Linger overlong in the midst of this maelstrom, and the aether that formeth one's soul shall surely be scattered, ne'er to be reformed."

It is imperative therefore that we speak with Kan–E–Senna without delay."
