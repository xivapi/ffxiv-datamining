1,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_SEQ_01","Though eager to depart, Alphinaud thinks it prudent to relay the details of the impending journey to Tataru. Return to Fortemps Manor, and speak with the waiting receptionist."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_SEQ_02","Having listened to the particulars of your mission, Tataru wishes you well, and promises to continue her search for the missing Scions in your absence. By way of a parting gift, she then presents Alphinaud with clothing more suited to the harsh conditions of the Coerthan wilderness. Your farewells now said, seek out Estinien at Saint Reinette's Forum, and inform him that you are ready to leave."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_SEQ_03","Alphinaud proposes that you begin the search for Lady Iceheart in the last place you encountered her─the Coerthas western highlands. Travel to Falcon's Nest, and speak with Ser Redwald for the latest reports on heretical activity in the area."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_SEQ_04","In response to Alphinaud's request for information, Ser Redwald suggests that you consult his knights─both a group soon to return from patrol, and an expedition sent to pick over the remnants of the heretic hideaway you discovered at Gorgagne Mills. While Estinien awaits the return of the patrol, head to the Gorgagne Holding with Alphinaud and question the leader of the knights assigned to search the farmhouse."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_SEQ_05","The expedition leader claims to have discovered a promising sheaf of letters in the farmhouse. Alas, these were not the only things the heretics left behind... Apparently, their “pets” fell upon the knights unexpectedly, wounding several, and preventing further investigation. Slay the beasts so that whatever remains of the heretics' missives can be retrieved."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_SEQ_06","You have slain the tamed polar bears lurking within the farmhouse. Inform the expedition leader that it is safe for his men to continue their investigation."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_SEQ_07","The expedition leader is relieved to hear that he and his men may return to their duties without fear of further maulings. All that remains is to claim the letters left behind by the heretics..."

73,"TEXT_HEAVNA303_01604_REDWALD_000_014","I see. Then you would be best served by speaking directly to my men. A patrol is due to return from its sweep of the surrounding lands at any moment."
