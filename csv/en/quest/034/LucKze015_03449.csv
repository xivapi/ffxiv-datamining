61,"TEXT_LUCKZE015_03449_DAVITH_000_040","A merchant arrived not long ago with our delivery. As he told it, some brave traveler dove into the lake to retrieve several jewels for him, and I suspect I know who."

65,"TEXT_LUCKZE015_03449_DAVITH_000_044","Of course, heartstones are not all made of the same jewel. Parents are to choose from one of several to be presented to their children. Thanks to you, we now have an ample selection."
