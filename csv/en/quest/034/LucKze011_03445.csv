50,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_KARNES_000_002","He was on guard duty that day when the sin eaters attacked. He fought so hard to keep us safe... But I wish he would've thought to save himself."

54,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_KARNES_000_006","I should've been able to handle this on my own! There weren't even any sin eaters nearby, but still I ran away. I'm a coward, Varthon, a bloody coward!!!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_007","Keep your voice down, before something hears you."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_008","I feel horrible for asking after I dragged you out here to find him, but I'd appreciate it if you could help a while longer."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_009","I can't stand to see him like this. Knowing him, the only thing that will get him out of this sour mood is finding his father's sword."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_010","Would you come with me to look for it? It should be somewhere near where his house used to be."

61,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_100_020","His house should be somewhere toward the heart of the settlement. Stay sharp. There's no telling what's lurking about."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_SYSTEM03445_100_021","Escort Varthon through the ruins of Fort Gohn. Should you fail to defend him, or move too far away, he will return to the outskirts of Fort Gohn, where you may rendezvous with him before trying again."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_100_030","Let's try and do this quietly."

69,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_101_031","(-Varthon-)Hmmm... No, that's not right. The pattern on the hilt is all wrong."

74,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_KARNES_000_041","By the blessed Dark, you found it! Holding this sword, it feels like he's right here beside me."
75,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_042","I remember that day, when the sin eaters came. His father was one of the bravest men I've ever met."
76,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_043","I'm sure he would have wanted you to have it."
