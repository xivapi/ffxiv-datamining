48,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_001","Traveler, have you a moment? I patrol the area to the north regularly, and for a long while there was nothing of note. Of late, however, I've been seeing a mysterious figure on the other side of the cliff."
49,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_002","I can't make out who─or what─that figure is, and it troubles me. Men are said to see better than us amaro. Will you not lend me your keen eyes?"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_003","My thanks. All you need to do is stand lookout at the cliffs by Longmirror Lake and the Church at Dammroen Field."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_004","I will see to other locations in the meantime. When you have finished, please come and meet me back here."

55,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_015","There you are. So tell me, what did you see?"

60,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_031","By the way, when you looked out to the north, you may have noticed the strange cracks on the mountain face. Do you know how they came to be there?"
61,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_032","They were hewn out by the faerie king when they fought the invading sin eaters."

63,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_034","To be sure, they weren't known as the king then, but simply Titania, ruler of the pixies. And it was they who rose to restore peace to the region in the wake of Voeburt's demise."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_035","In the manner in which Titania united us against the sin eaters, the faeries saw an image of the king of fallen Voeburt."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_036","So it was that, as a show of respect, we came to likewise refer to them as king. Alas, to our great sorrow, they would be corrupted by the Light and become that which they fought."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZD203_03433_PATROLAMARO03433_000_037","Those cracks are a reminder of how our king protected us, and beholding them spurs me to remain vigilant. But forgive me, I've gone on quite a ramble. Thank you for helping me to put my worries to rest."
