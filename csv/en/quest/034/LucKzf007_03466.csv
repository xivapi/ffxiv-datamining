49,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_001","Ah...oh, no. My apologies for the outburst. I confused you for someone I once knew. Something about you...seems so familiar."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_002","Perhaps you are a traveler as well? All who embark upon that path have a singular way about them. You must know much of the world outside the wood. Please, could you humor me with a story or two?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_100_002","Haha, a wise choice. You knew I would not stop at asking for two. Well, if ever you find yourself idle and eager to entertain, I shall be here."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_110_002","You agree!? Oh, many thanks to you. I am so starved for amusement these days."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_003","I heard tell that Lakeland had been abandoned. I once heard the name of the elves' new home in passing, but for the life of me I cannot recall it."

55,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_A1_000_001","You speak of the Crystarium."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_A1_000_002","Are you thinking of Eulmore?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_004","Yes, yes, the Crystarium. They say that the Crystal Exarch conjured the spire in an instant. Oh, to wield such power..."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_005","Eulmore? Are you certain? No...the name had a different ring to it. It was almost...vibrant."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_006","What of Nabaath Areng? That city produced such lustering trinkets! Does it still stand?"

62,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_A2_000_002","It was consumed in the Flood."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_007","How dreadful! Truly, the Flood spared no land..."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_008","Of course... The Flood brought ruin to even the grandest of cities..."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_009","Tell me, have you heard of the Warriors of Light? Grand heroes, saviors of worlds, and so on."

67,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_A3_000_001","Not saviors. Destroyers."

69,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_A3_000_003","Of course. I am a Warrior of Light."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_010","Is that so? I suppose you are right, given the state of things here."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_011","Indeed they are. I am glad to know there are some in this world who still believe in heroism."
72,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_012","Hah, of course you are! I am full glad there are still those who admire their bravery. It warms my heart to see."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_013","I must thank you again for providing this old woman with company. Please, would you walk with me?"
74,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_014","Since you have been so kind, I would tell you a story of my own in return. However, it would not do if I were to be overheard. There is a place where we may speak in private, to the west. It will not take long."
75,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_019","Thank you for coming. You may wonder why I brought you here. "
76,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_020","You see, long ago in these very woods, I was wounded, and nursed back to health by travelers much like yourself. They were hunting a very specific prey, and in exchange for my help they shared stories of the outside world."
77,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_021","I remember very fondly that night, huddled by the fire, regaled by their wondrous tales. Although our time together was short, I know for certain there was naught but good in their hearts."
78,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_022","When I heard that those selfsame travelers brought about the Flood, I refused to believe it."
79,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_023","However, even if it is true, even if they caused this world's ruin... I cannot blame them. If they did somehow have a hand in it...it was not a willing one."
80,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_024","You know as well as I, but we Viis can live well over two centuries. I myself have seen my hundredth nameday come and go."
81,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_025","If the heavens deem it fit, we can live well over two centuries. I myself have seen my hundredth nameday come and go."
82,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_026","Even so, too many of us have met premature ends at the hands of the sin eaters. There are not many left who remember the time before the Flood. "
83,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_027","That is why I was compelled to tell you of those travelers, so you might leave here with full knowledge of their character. Thank you for lending an ear to my story."
