Phyna would take another step to realizing her dream."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_01","Phyna and Ciuna have been given permission to leave Fanow. Before setting their sights on the far reaches of Norvrandt, however, they decide on visiting a settlement close to home─Slitherbough. Knowing full well their presence will incite panic among the Night's Blessed, they ask you to accompany them. With a smile and a nod you agree to help, prompting them to leave for Slitherbough."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_02","As you approach the entrance to Slitherbough, two familiar faces of the Night's Blessed are there to greet you─Valan and Quinfort. The reason, it seems, is that Quinfort has had yet another vision of catastrophe, and he is all but convinced the great serpent is somewhere close by. He throws all caution to the wind and runs off into the woods in search of the supposedly mythical snake, with Ciuna hot on his trail. Phyna bids you follow them to guarantee their safety while she escorts Valan back to Fanow."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_03","Traveling south, you find Ciuna fending off a pair of wild caracals. At her side is Quinfort and the strange creature you have come to know as the great serpent."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_04","With the danger passed, the three of you return to Fanow in the hopes that Lanille can offer you counsel."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_05","Though Lanille is skeptical of the great serpent, she nevertheless takes heed of Quinfort's visions. One particular point of his prophetic ramblings─a giant snake in the lake west of Slitherbough─gives her pause. She is suddenly reminded of the ancient writings found in the Great Pyramid of Ux'ner. Unfortunately, none may enter save for the late emperor...and a certain adventurer who just so happens to possess the seal of Ronka. With the ancient artifact in hand, you depart with the others to the Morning Stars."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_06","The others cannot accompany you inside, so you are left to wander the hallowed halls of the pyramid alone. You search high and low and find three stone tablets with carvings resembling animals of the forest. Quinfort and the others are certain to be excited by your discovery."
7,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_07","At the sight of the tablets Quinfort can hardly contain his excitement. He rushes off to Fanow, eager to have Lanille decipher their writings."
8,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_SEQ_08","The writings of the tablets weave a fascinating tale of a kingdom that was once guarded by not one, but two tribes. This knowledge reaffirms Phyna's decision to reach out to their sisters beyond the Greatwood. And, thanks to the presence of Valan and Quinfort, she and her fellow Viis soon realize there are hands willing to help in Slitherbough as well."

The battle raged for many days and many nights and finally, the ancient guardian stood triumphant. The dreaded snake was sealed in an immense jewel, its true name never to be uttered again. The years spent in slumber quelled its rage, and the seething ire it once exuded became a benign aura. Man came to worship the jewel, and thus the great destroyer became the great protector of the wood."
109,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_LANILLE_000_112","“After the great sealing, the emperor commanded his fiercest sentinels to the east to keep guard of the Great Pyramid of Ux'ner. To the west, he sent his priests who would watch over the slumbering serpent from the Covered Halls of Dwatl. Together they would protect the empire, and so did it thrive."
110,"TEXT_LUCKZF201_03482_LANILLE_000_113","“Alas, in a strange twist of fate, the temple to the west would be submerged beneath the waters of Lake Tusi Mek'ta, its priests drowned.

And the guards of the pyramid would become guardians of an ever-expanding forest.”"
