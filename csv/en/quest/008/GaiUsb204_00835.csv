Unwilling to take this antagonism sitting down, Fyrilsunn has prepared makeshift bombs, which he bids you throw at the kobolds' refiners to destroy them."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB204_00835_SEQ_02","You have blown up all of the kobolds' refiners and have dispatched the angry bombs that were powering them. Report to Fyrilsunn."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB204_00835_SEQ_03","Fyrilsunn gives you a warm welcome upon your return, having witnessed the refiners' demise from his location. He expresses concern, however, at the fact that Costa del Sol is likely ill equipped to deal with future antagonistic acts from the kobolds. It would seem as though you might be needed in the area a bit longer."
