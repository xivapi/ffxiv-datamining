0,"TEXT_GAIUSB601_00883_SEQ_00","Father Iliud has some parting words for you and the others."
1,"TEXT_GAIUSB601_00883_SEQ_01","Father Iliud suggests that you begin your search for Cid's airship in Fallgourd Float, located in Gridania's North Shroud. Journey to the settlement and speak with the Twin Adder forces stationed there for more information."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB601_00883_SEQ_02","The final flight of the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> appears to be a well-known moment in Gridanian history, as Aethelmaer has no trouble recounting the event. He bids you speak with Vortefaurt at Florentel's Spire, a sentry who saw the airship with his own eyes that day five years ago."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB601_00883_SEQ_03","Vortefaurt confirms that he bore witness to the vessel's passing. Listen well as the veteran Wailer spins his yarn, for it shall doubtless provide essential information that leads you to the errant vessel's location."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSB601_00883_ILIUD_000_002","I know not how much truth there is to it, but there is a tale known as, “The Final Flight of the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>,” which grew popular in the wake of the Calamity─much like “The Great Goobbue Wall of Ul'dah.” It states that the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> flew northwest from Gridania towards Coerthas."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSB601_00883_ILIUD_000_003","If true, the airship would have passed through the North Shroud, likely over Fallgourd Float─the closest settlement to Coerthas. Mayhap the Serpents stationed there have records of the events that transpired that day."
