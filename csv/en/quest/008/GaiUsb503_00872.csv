2,"TEXT_GAIUSB503_00872_SEQ_02","You scour Ul'dah and acquire the necessary tools. Deliver the tools to Marques at the Church of Saint Adama Landama."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB503_00872_SEQ_03","Upon receiving the tools, Marques immediately sets to work and repairs the horologe, as if by instinct─an act that only serves to unnerve the troubled refugee. Apologizing for the inconvenience, he bids you take the device to Sister Eluned, who is currently tending to the body of its owner outside the church."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB503_00872_SEQ_04","Sister Eluned has never before seen an intricate device like the horologe, which is reminiscent of the technological marvels Garlemald is said to possess. The brief association causes her to suspect that the deceased owner may have been a Garlean spy, and she considers informing the Immortal Flames stationed in Camp Drybone. However, Marques's ability to repair the horologe appears to be an even more stunning revelation, one which also bears further investigation."

I would ask that you journey to Ul'dah in my stead to obtain a bull-point chisel and a pair of needle-nose pincers.
