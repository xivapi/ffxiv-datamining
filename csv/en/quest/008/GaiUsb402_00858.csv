2,"TEXT_GAIUSB402_00858_SEQ_02","You deliver the plea to Commander Bloeidin, who laments Blaugybal's callowness and disallows the reinstatement. He clearly does so out of care rather than malice, but Blaugybal's disappointment will be great."

51,"TEXT_GAIUSB402_00858_BLAUGYBAL_000_003","Between here and Camp Overlook is kobold territory, as the crow flies. I suggest you be smart about it: go to Jijiroon's Trading Post and take a boat across the lake. From there, head north to outer La Noscea."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSB402_00858_BLOEIDIN_000_023","What I'm saying is, you want to know where the worst of the fighting is? Just look for the Red Swallows. This is the front, not a moment of rest from the kobolds. Ain't no place for a pup with half-healed wounds."
