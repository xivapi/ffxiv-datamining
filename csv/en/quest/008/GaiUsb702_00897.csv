1,"TEXT_GAIUSB702_00897_SEQ_01","Lord Haurchefant explains that while the High Houses of Ishgard are unwilling or unable to offer you formal assistance in your search, there are nevertheless influential individuals in the High Houses that may be sympathetic to your cause. More specifically, he suggests that you speak with Lady Ninne of House Fortemps, Cravellin of House Haillenarte, and Chief Astrologian Forlemort of House Durendaire."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB702_00897_SEQ_02","Contrary to Lord Haurchefant's expectations, the three Ishgardians provide you with no information relevant to your search. Return to Lord Haurchefant and share with him your findings─or lack thereof, rather."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB702_00897_SEQ_03","With regret, Lord Haurchefant tells you that his inquiries have yet to yield any useful information. It seems that the only topic of discussion in recent times is that of heretics in the High Houses..."

52,"TEXT_GAIUSB702_00897_HAURCHEFANT_000_002","Lady Ninne of mine own House Fortemps, who resides here in Camp Dragonhead, rather enjoys the company of travelers. There is also Cravellin of House Haillenarte, who can be found at Skyfire Locks─though any information you pry from the scribe may prove difficult to parse."
