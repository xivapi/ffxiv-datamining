1,"TEXT_GAIUSB509_00878_SEQ_01","The Church of Saint Adama Landama can perform rites for most of the fallen Scions. However, Noraxia, a sylph from Little Solace, is an exception. Sister Eluned believes that it would be best if the sylph's body was returned to her home in the Black Shroud, and she asks that you accept this responsibility."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB509_00878_SEQ_02","The sylphs thank you for bringing Noraxia's remains back home. Though her death has been cause for great sadness in Little Solace, it has also sparked anger against the imperials. When the time comes to confront the forces responsible, it would be wise to seek the aid of the humble forest dwellers. Return to Sister Eluned at the Church of Saint Adama Landama."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB509_00878_SEQ_03","Upon your return, Sister Eluned informs you that the last of your comrades has finally been laid to rest in the lichyard. Sister Eluned further implores you to set aside your burdens and take a rest, as you have already done so much on behalf of the fallen Scions."
