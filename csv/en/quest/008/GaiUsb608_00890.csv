0,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_SEQ_00","Ser Carrilaut has something very important to tell you."
1,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_SEQ_01","Ser Carrilaut tells you in hushed whispers that Lord Francel could not possibly be a heretic, and that these accusations could prove disastrous for House Haillenarte. He bids you deliver a warning to Lord Francel at Skyfire Locks, adding further that you should speak to him of an edelweiss so that he knows you can be trusted."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_SEQ_02","Lord Francel laments that this is only the latest in a series of incessant accusations against House Haillenarte. Alas, he will likely have to answer to the inquisitors, even if the charges are without merit. Given these circumstances, he cannot assist you in your search for the airship. Instead, he furnishes you with a letter of introduction to House Fortemps, assuring you that Lord Haurchefant of Camp Dragonhead will offer you his full support."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_SEQ_03","Lord Haurchefant's face darkens as he reads the contents of the missive and learns of the charges against Lord Francel. Putting his frustrations aside, he invites you to stay in Camp Dragonhead as a guest of House Fortemps, and states that he will make inquiries on your behalf. Having found a powerful friend in Coerthas, it may be wise to repay his kindness."

59,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_FRANCEL_000_030","Then you have come to the wrong place, for we of House Haillenarte bear the rose. Mayhap you should journey to Gridania? I believe an ancient Duskwight house was said to use the white lily as its sigil."
60,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_FRANCEL_000_040","...What an odd thing to say. Did you perchance receive a blow to the head not long ago? Or is this some queer southron jest?"
61,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_FRANCEL_000_050","I see Ser Carrilaut has not forgotten my mother's favorite flower. A pity it has not been seen in Coerthas since the Calamity. You may speak freely here, friend."

Although the draconian rosary was not found in my possession, it will still be considered by many to be proof of my “heresy.” I must do my utmost to prove my innocence to the inquisitors, for if they harbor even the slightest doubt..."
64,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_FRANCEL_000_053","<sigh> This will only add weight to the incessant accusations our house has suffered of late. It's as though the gods themselves are plotting our fall..."

69,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_HAURCHEFANT_000_061","Truth be told, I would gladly welcome many and more brave souls like yourself. But enough chatter─pray tell me why you have come."

71,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_HAURCHEFANT_000_063","It is beyond inconceivable... Ah, yes. The letter made mention of a pressing matter for which you required assistance. What might that be?"
72,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_HAURCHEFANT_000_064","So this <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> you speak of was last seen above Coerthas before the Calamity five years ago. I fear it may prove difficult to find any eyewitnesses to these events, for while Ishgard did not participate in the Battle of Carteneau, we were embroiled in our own internal conflicts at the time."
73,"TEXT_GAIUSB608_00890_HAURCHEFANT_000_065","Nevertheless, I will make inquiries on your behalf and share with you my findings in the future."
