1,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_SEQ_01","According to Vortefaurt, the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> disappeared over the mountains of Coerthas to the northwest. Presuming it was not destroyed during the Calamity, he recommends that you elicit the cooperation of the astrologians at the Observatorium, who were doubtless monitoring the skies that night and possess information that may be valuable to the search. However, as Ishgardians are wont to turn away outsiders, Vortefaurt advises you to first offer your services to the soldiers who guard the Observatorium, as a gesture of goodwill."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_SEQ_02","Your offer of aid is curtly refused by the Ishgardian knight. It may require aggressive efforts on your part to convince the locals that you mean no harm."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_VORTEFAURT_000_001","Then, all of a sudden, the most fantastic airship I'd ever seen splits the sky overhead! I could only watch in shock as it disappeared over the mountains to the northwest. If the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> wasn't destroyed during the Calamity, I'd wager it's still somewhere in Coerthas."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_VORTEFAURT_000_002","The astrologians at the Observatorium may have records which could help. But to obtain them, you would need to deal with the Ishgardians who control the region. I wouldn't expect much, though─the High Houses have long been concerned with their own affairs above all else. When Dalamud descended, they took shelter behind their gates, and even now they have little regard for the plights of other nations."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_VORTEFAURT_000_003","Nevertheless, they may deign to assist you should you prove yourself useful. Consider providing your services to the soldiers who guard the Observatorium. Though they may refuse you at first, I've little doubt they would accept aid freely offered."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_LUDOVOIX_000_010","Excuse me, can you repeat that? You wish to offer your services to House Durendaire? And what, pray tell, do you wish to receive in exchange?"
53,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_LUDOVOIX_000_011","Hah, how absurd! As if we would permit an outsider to peruse the records of the Observatorium."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_LUDOVOIX_000_012","Do not mistake our courtesy for friendliness. The Holy See of Ishgard may allow foreigners to travel freely within these lands, but we do not intend to offer succor to strangers."
