1,"TEXT_GAIUSB105_00824_SEQ_01","As the time of the Choosing draws ever nearer, U'khuba Tia does not favor the notion that U'tykha Tia is seen by many as the next chief of the U tribe. He bids you speak with immigrants, and discover their hopes for Forgotten Springs."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB105_00824_SEQ_02","You have spoken with three citizens newly immigrated to Forgotten Springs, and have found they all share some amount of discontentment at the lack of change. Return to U'khuba Tia and share with him their complaints."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB105_00824_SEQ_03","U'khuba Tia responds to your words as though he has heard them before, acknowledging that the U tribe will have to break with tradition in order to evolve. Whether the incorporation of such changes will result in positive growth, however, is a question to which no one has an answer."

His strain of foolish cheer can be catching, and I've found it wise to never become <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> happy. Happiness begets complacency, and it's only through discontentment that one rises to become more."
49,"TEXT_GAIUSB105_00824_UKHUBATIA_000_001","This brings us to the issue of which one of us will next lead our tribe. Unlike U'tykha, the matter of who becomes the next nunh is one I take most seriously. Each of us represents a distinct vision for what lies ahead."
