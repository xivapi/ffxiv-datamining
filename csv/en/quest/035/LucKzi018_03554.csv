He was strapping and sweet, and so I learned his patrol route. Brought him iguana tails, talked about sediment─you know, the usual stuff."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZI018_03554_DWARF03554_000_014","Then, once we'd gotten to know each other, I confessed my feelings. But he refused me, saying he could never court a Tholl. Said it was impossible..."
