48,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_000","Greetings, finless one, and thank you! Others may be distressed by the change you have wrought, but I consider this to be the opportunity of a lifetime! An opportunity to sssavor the fruits of the land!"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_001","Quite literally, in fact, for I wish to make oranges! So deliciousss are the ones we have purchased from traders, full of surprisingly sssour sweetness!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_002","I kept the ssseeds of the one I sssupped upon, and now that the sea has been parted, I can at last try my hand at agricultural endeavors! Or I would...if I knew aught of it. What exactly is agriculture, anyway?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_003","So...you bury the seeds in the earth, and with the aid of the sssun's light, it grows into a tree? Not unlike kelp, then? Well! We certainly do not want for earth here, that much I can say."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_004","We will need a sssubstitute for the sun's light, though. Fortunately, I already have something in mind! Come with me and see for yourself. It is not far─due east of the Cups. Come, come!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_010","This is...or was...a variety of feather ssstar─a creature of the sea that shimmers with the radiance of a flower in bloom. Alas, in the absssence of water, it is rather less radiant than I remember..."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_011","No need to say it. I know this will not do. But worry not! I know of another possible sssolution! Follow me to the northwest, past Where the Dry Return."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_020","See this white anemone and the ssstarfish which resides above it? Both radiate a gentle light to lure fish that they might feast. Surely this will serve for our purposes?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_A1_000_001","Can't say it looks all that promising."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_A1_000_002","The light looks a little weak..."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_021","Oh, is it now? I rather thought it was... Hmm. Ssso be it. I do have one final idea, though it is a bit far, so let us first return to the Cups."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_025","I must apologize, finless one, for making you walk hither and thither to no end. I only hope that this third option will meet with your approval..."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_026","It is far, far below, and a fair ways to the west besides. Mind your footing and take care not to ssslip."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_030","Behold! Is it not wondrousssly bright? So many lussstrous plants filling the cavern with their light─surely there is no better place for us to plant our orange seeds!?"

65,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_A2_000_002","It's barely enough. Barely."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_031","Huzzah, I knew it! And with a little more light, the oranges will grow as plump and juicy as they would on land!"
67,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_032","I cannot thank you enough, finless one, but I aim to try! Let us return to the Cups at once!"
68,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_040","You are too kind, my friend, accompanying me all over in my quest to find a second sun for my beloved oranges. We may not know for some time if the flora and fauna of the sea can provide enough light, but I look forward to finding out!"
69,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_041","Most Ondo have never known the joy that is a juicy orange, but one day they will! I shall have an orchard, and every Ondo shall feassst on its fruits!"
