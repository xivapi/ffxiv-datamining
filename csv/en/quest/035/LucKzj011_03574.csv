48,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_000","Ho there! You are the traveler who is the talk of the village, yes? Superb! There is a small favor I was hoping to ask of you. Have you, by chance, in your journeys across the realm, encountered those curious little creatures known as the Mord?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_001","Splendid! That's just the answer I was hoping to hear. I would be most obliged if you could meet with a Mord merchant who's come to town and negotiate a simple transaction on my behalf."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_002","Under normal circumstances, I would of course go myself, but I fear there is a matter of most pressing business to which I must attend."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_003","I've asked around the village, but everyone─even some of the burliest fisherman types─seems downright frightened of the little fellow. I suppose they can't be blamed. We don't see many of their kind in these parts, after all, and the unfamiliar can be off-putting."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_004","At any rate, I would appreciate it ever so much if you could handle this task in my stead. Needless to say, I will see that you are duly compensated upon your return."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_005","I can scarcely wait to see what wondrous wares the Mord merchant has brought with him this time!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_MORD03574_000_010","Hm? You are the one from Rhon Ron's shop, yes? Yes, yes, you are! If you come for more smooth and shiny pots, I am afraid you come at the wrong time. No, no, I have none today."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_MORD03574_000_011","What is this? Chewy and salty salted fish liver? Yes, this is most tasty! Many a Mord will pay good coin to put this in his belly, oh yes!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_MORD03574_000_012","And this bottle. I have seen it before, yes, I have. You were sent by someone from Knot, no? Then I have the perfect thing for you. Take this in return, and let the villagers rejoice and resound!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_MORD03574_000_013","What is it, you ask? Why, it is full to the brim with the plumpest, juiciest, squirmiest worms you have ever seen! I know it is tempting, but try not to gobble and gorge yourself on them, yes?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_MORD03574_000_014","You will come back to Mord Souq someday, yes? Yes, you are most welcome─especially if you buy something at my shop! I will assemble the finest and shiniest pots for you, yes I will!"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_020","Ah, there you are, friend! I trust the transaction went smoothly?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_021","Would you look at these worms! So plump, so juicy! Why, I can almost see why the Mord enjoy─ Er, perhaps not. At any rate, our fishermen will be overjoyed. Bait like this is sure to bring in a healthy haul."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_022","I mean to make a point that this would not be possible without the cooperation of the Mord. Eventually, I hope to convince them that the little fellows aren't so bad after all. They're actually quite charming, wouldn't you agree? At any rate, thank you, friend. I trust this will suffice as payment for your efforts?"
