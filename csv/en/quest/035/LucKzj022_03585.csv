51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ022_03585_WORRYONDO03585_000_003","But it makes no sense to me! What would finless ones gain from this ssskullduggery? Or was there a misunderstanding─can your kind eat gravel as easily as grain?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZJ022_03585_WORRYONDO03585_000_004","No, I thought not...but then why did the finless youths give my friend gravel instead of the promisssed grain? It makes no sssense. Will you go and speak with the Mystel woman with whom he brokered the deal? "

54,"TEXT_LUCKZJ022_03585_WORRYONDO03585_000_010","I cannot fathom why we would be given gravel instead of grain. I can but hope that Mosha-Moa can shhhed some light on this matter."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZJ022_03585_WORRYONDO03585_000_011","I pray this is all the result of a simple misssunderstanding and not deliberate deception or worse. It would be a shhhame if the Ondo's relations with the people of Wright were to deteriorate because of this incident..."

58,"TEXT_LUCKZJ022_03585_MOSHAMOA_000_022","On behalf of the Ondo trader, you say? Is there anyone you don't know? Anyway, the arrangement was simple: grain for shells I could in turn resell as raw materials to jewelers."
