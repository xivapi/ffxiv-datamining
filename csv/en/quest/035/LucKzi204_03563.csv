50,"TEXT_LUCKZI204_03563_XORUTT_000_002","Now, here in Tomra, there are three keys to a successful drinking party. The first is a good drop of ale─that goes without saying. The second is a table laid with tasty treats. And the last─and possibly most important─is a raucous drinking song!"

55,"TEXT_LUCKZI204_03563_MAGUTT_000_012","Every Tomran has been hearing that ditty since they was children. You only need one dwarf to start singing and soon the whole village'll join in! Ah, there's no grander feeling than hoisting your mug and yelling your loudest “lali-ho”!"
