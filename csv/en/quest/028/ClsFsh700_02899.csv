1,"TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_SEQ_01","An ecstatic Wawalago explains that he has unearthed a wealth of wisdom on the Wadatsumi festivities, and is ready to make the journey east and lead the revival of this time-honored tradition. Ready for the most intense fishing challenge of your career, you make your way to Kugane to rendezvous with Reyna."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_SEQ_02","You arrive in Kugane to find that Reyna's fellow fishing enthusiast Ansaulme has also taken time away from his struggle for succession to join you and your companions in this grand fishing festival─one that, if all goes according to plan, will also result in the return to the seas of the harutsuge, the shooting stars treasured by the Sahagin. Join Master Wawalago in Isari, and let the festivities begin!"
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_SEQ_03","In Isari, Wawalago elaborates on the nature of the festival. At its essence a celebration of the spirit of the cooperation between man and Kojin, the ritual will unfold as follows: the Kojin, joined by Govv, will pursue the plesiosaurs from beneath the waves, chasing them to the surface, where the anglers lying in wait will lure them in. As the guildmaster's most proven protégé, you are tasked by Wawalago with hauling in the lion's share of your prized prey. Make for the waters of Onokoro, and do battle with these ferocious fiends of the deep!"
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_SEQ_04","Together with your companions, you haul in a heaping pile of plesiosaurs, pleasing the kami of the deep and restoring peace to the oceans and balance to the natural order of things. Govv grows concerned, however, when he can spy no sign of his precious shooting stars despite the removal of their most puissant predator, and dives into the depths in pursuit. At Wawalago's behest, you join him, and after a brief moment of concern, are treated to the stunning sight of a massive school of young harutsuge swimming all around you. Breathing a sigh of relief, you return to the surface with Govv, taking solace that your efforts were not for naught, and these delightful denizens of the sea will survive and prosper. Back in Isari, Wawalago begins to pontificate on the potential repercussions of your actions today, when he is interrupted by an irate Sisipu, who he neglected to inform of his intent to make the journey east. As the two run off, you turn to your companions with a smile, happy to see man and beastman alike united by a deep love of the sea."

63,"TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_WAWALAGO_000_051","Our prize and prey is the giant plesiosaur, a massive monstrosity of a fish as fierce and ferocious as any you'll find. Go after one without a precise plan of attack, and you're like as not to get swallowed and spit out a skeleton."

81,"TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_WAWALAGO_000_102","Hah hah! That's the spirit, my shelled friend. By repeating the ritual on a regular basis, we can protect the seas from the over-proliferation of predators, and see that smaller fish like the harutsuge have a halcyon habitat to call home."
82,"TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_GOVV_000_103","Pssshhh... While it pleassses me as much as any that the fessstival was a success and peace returns to the ssseas, I fear I sssee no sign of the shooting ssstars."
