1,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SEQ_01","Knowing her son is safe is simply not enough for Berehta. She asks that you continue your search, suggesting you begin in Ala Ghiri, where he likely went to rest and gather supplies."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SEQ_02","Speaking with the people of Ala Ghiri, it would seem the Allied forces may know something of Erart. Perhaps one of the Grand Company officers stationed there can offer more information as to his whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SEQ_03","You speak with a flame captain who confirms a man from Coldhearth fitting Erart's description is a part of his unit. Unfortunately, he has already been dispatched to Specula Imperatoris to dispense with the potential threat of Garlean drones. You set your sights north in hopes of meeting with him before he leaves elsewhere."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SEQ_04","You arrive to find a golden-locked lieutenant who you are confident is the man you are looking for. Before he will take time to speak with you, however, he insists on completing the task set before him. To that end, you assist him in searching for any drones that may be hiding in the abandoned Garlean base."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SEQ_05","After searching several locations as instructed by the lieutenant, you locate and destroy a number of malfunctioning drones. Perhaps now you can finally get answers."
6,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SEQ_06","The lieutenant is, in fact, from Coldhearth, but he is sadly not the man you were expecting. That said, he is certain the Resistance will know where Erart has escaped to."

54,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_JNAIROH_000_020","Come to think of it, the soldiers who stopped by my shop mentioned someone who came from Coldhearth. Could be they know the man you're looking for."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_WEIDHERI_000_030","Erart? Ah, a few bells ago a pair of customers mentioned him. Can't say what else they talked about, though. It's not my place to pry."

71,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SECONDLIEUTENANT02862_000_073","Five years ago, the Garleans came and conscripted any able-bodied men they could find. I was one of the unlucky few to be sent to Doma. Or so I thought."

73,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SECONDLIEUTENANT02862_000_075","What followed was a perilous venture with no promise of a tomorrow. Yet somehow I managed my way to Ul'dah where I enlisted in the Immortal Flames."
74,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SECONDLIEUTENANT02862_000_076","I'm honestly surprised Coldhearth is still there after all this time. With the population dwindling as it was, I was certain the Garleans had robbed the place of all its prospective soldiers and put the rest to the sword. "
75,"TEXT_STMBDZ906_02862_SECONDLIEUTENANT02862_000_077","But enough of my ramblings. Unfortunately I don't know the man you're looking for, but if he was seeking safety, he likely found it with the Resistance."
