49,"TEXT_STMBDZ803_02831_ODO_000_001","As you're well aware, the battle at Rhalgr's Reach was gruesome, with heavy losses on both sides. If what I've been told is true, our losses would have been far greater, if not for one brave soul."

56,"TEXT_STMBDZ803_02831_MAELSTROMGENERAL_000_012","With all due respect, you are mistaken. It was a unit of the Twin Adder that was charged with relaying communications to Alliance commanders. I believe a few of their officers are still stationed at Goodblade if you wish to speak with them."
