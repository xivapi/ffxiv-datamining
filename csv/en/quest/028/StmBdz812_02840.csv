49,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_001","Speaking of which, she's been looking for you. Probably to thank you again for rescuing her."

51,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_003","I'm fairly certain my sister was near the northeastern gate."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_010","Ah, I'm glad you've come."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_011","My sister was quite upset with me before, and rightfully so. I promised her I won't run off alone and put myself in danger, which is why I need your help."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_012","I mean to slay a group of kongamato nesting nearby, but not merely for training. No, this is for the good of all of Ala Ghiri."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_013","They've begun breeding, laying eggs in the watering hole north of here. If they continue, they'll ruin one of the few sources of water we have. Come, we must put an end to them."

60,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_041","A shame not all of the J tribe think so highly of her. They say she abandoned her home and the tribe, but I don't believe she would do such a thing. Not if there was another way."
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_042","I know she would have stayed if there was. She would have fought and protected us all. One day I'll be strong enough to do what she couldn't."

64,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_045","That said, I'm like to stumble a few times along the way. I hope I can look to you again for help if I need it."

66,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_051","So she's involved you in more trouble, has she? Well, I can't get mad at her for protecting the watering hole."
67,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_052","<sigh> I keep forgetting my little sister isn't quite so little anymore. And it seems a knack for fighting runs in the family."
68,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_053","Speaking of which, curiosity got the better of me, and I asked a few of the soldiers if they knew aught of my aunt."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_054","They say a woman matching her description works closely with a man named Arenvald. I plan to send her a letter, asking her to come bid her sister a final farewell."
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_055","If my sister finds out, she's like to run off in search of her. I hope she doesn't, but I can't stop her from living her own life. Should that day come, I'll just have to...to..."
