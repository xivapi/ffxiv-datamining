48,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_000","Oh, hey there. Thanks again for helping me before. Word around town is you're some sort of adventurer, is that right? I'm in a bit of a tight spot, and you're likely the only one who can help me."
49,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_001","You see, I need legs from the chapulis hopping about outside of town─three or so should do the trick. I'd go myself, but they'd stomp me in the ground faster than a sabotender in a sandstorm."
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_002","What do I need them for? You'll have to wait and see."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_003","You won't have to go far to find the chapulis hopping around out there. If you can get me three of their legs, that should be more than enough."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_010","The chapulis give you any trouble?"
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_011","These are pretty plump. Looks like you found a lively lot out there. Aye, these'll make for a good stew. It's a specialty of mine─a nice, spicy broth with chunks of meat so tender they practically melt in your mouth. I find chapuli legs work best."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_012","The Garleans thought we were savages for eating the stuff, but now that they're gone, this Ala Ghiri stew is back on the menu."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_013","I'm sure the soldiers will find it a welcome change from the rock-hard breads and salted meats they're used to."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_014","And you too. Be sure to stop by for a bowl sometime. My treat."
