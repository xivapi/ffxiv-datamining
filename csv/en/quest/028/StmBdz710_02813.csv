55,"TEXT_STMBDZ710_02813_MERCHANTA02813_000_012","Intriguing. It says here that silks of the finest quality are available at a fraction of the market price. I shall go and see these wares for myself. Thank you, stranger."

64,"TEXT_STMBDZ710_02813_MERCHANTD02813_000_021","Oh my, that is a surprise indeed. To think that such a young child was actually working. I thought him at some play or prank. Do the merchants of Kugane start their trade at such a young age? I find that both inspiring and admirable."
