1,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_SEQ_01","His voice brimming with delight, Jehantel informs you that Sanson, with whom you previously journeyed, has succeeded in gaining official approval for his bard unit. Even now, the young serpent captain rounds up members for its maiden mission, in relation to which he apparently has a favor to ask of you. Take yourself to Quiver's Hold in Gridania and see what your friend requires."
2,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_SEQ_02","Greeting you warmly, Sanson requests your participation in his unit's first outing. If you would lend him your aid, join him at the Adders' Nest, where he will receive his orders from Commander Vorsaile Heuloix."
3,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_SEQ_03","An anonymous letter has arrived at the Adders' Nest, which claims the existence of a tome bearing a damning secret pertaining to the Autumn War. In order to curb the growing anti-Ala Mhigan sentiment among Gridanians, the Order of the Twin Adder has decided to dispatch Sanson's newly formed unit to investigate. Head to Nine Ivies in the East Shroud and seek out the letter's mysterious sender."
4,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_SEQ_04","At Nine Ivies, you make contact with the letter's sender, a native of Gridania named Nourval. The young man claims to be descended from a soldier who fought in the Autumn War, and based on his parents' account, the tome in question is to be found somewhere in Gyr Abania. He offers to assist in the search on the condition that he is permitted to join it, and Sanson relents. Make your way now to Castrum Oriens, which lies on the region's fringes."
5,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_SEQ_05","At Nourval's recommendation, Sanson decides that the unit will remain in Castrum Oriens for a while to gather information. Take a rest for now, and be ready to depart when your comrades are done making their respective inquiries.

※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 63."

85,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_NOURVAL_000_084","(-Nourval-)Patience, my friends. I will explain. You see, like many Gridanians, I have an ancestor who fought in the Autumn War. 'Twas he who first learned of the tome in question, after the fighting had ended."
86,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_NOURVAL_000_085","(-Nourval-)In turn, I learned of it from my parents, and since then I've dreamed of poring over its pages. Alas, as it lies deep within Ala Mhigan territory, I was resigned never to have the chance."

88,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_NOURVAL_000_087","(-Nourval-)...Or so I told myself, before I thought better of it. I'm no soldier, you see, and the prospect of wandering a war-ravaged land in search of a tome is, frankly, unrealistic. That's why I decided to reach out to your order for cooperation."
89,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_NOURVAL_000_088","(-Nourval-)Based on my parents' account, I'm confident that I can track down the tome. And I will help you to find it. I ask only that you take me with you."
90,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_NOURVAL_000_089","(-Nourval-)...So what say you? I'm but a commoner and know little of the ways of nations, but it seems to me such secrets as the tome conceals could be harmful to diplomatic relations. Is this not so?"
91,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_SANSON_000_090","So if we wish to find the tome, we must agree to your company. Quite a demand to make of your nation."
