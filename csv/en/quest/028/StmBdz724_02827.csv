1,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_SEQ_01","Believing he has sufficiently recovered from his rigorous training session, M'zhet Tia prepares to go to the Peering Stones to confront M'rahz Nunh. He asks that you accompany him to bear witness to his victory."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_SEQ_02","M'rahz Nunh agrees to duel. However, he insists on moving the battle to a ravine southeast of the Peering Stones. M'zhet consents and takes his leave of the camp. Follow him to the ravine and wait for the fight to begin."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_SEQ_03","It seems M'rahz Nunh has come not to fight, but to talk. As he tells it, M'zhet Tia's father left the village of his own volition, staying close by to keep watch over his former tribe. When a herd of ravenous monsters came stampeding toward the Peering Stones, he sacrificed himself to stop the herd, leaving his son in the Ananta's care. The weight of this revelation has left M'zhet Tia bereft of the resolve to fight. What will he do now?"
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_SEQ_04","Knowing of his father's selfless sacrifice has inspired M'zhet Tia. He soon makes for the Peering Stones to speak with M'rahz Nunh."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_SEQ_05","M'zhet Tia wishes to rejoin the M tribe to someday carry on in his father's footsteps. Should he become nunh someday, he plans to once again challenge the friend and mentor who helped to reunite him with his people."

61,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_023","A terrible tale told to me by the Vira."
62,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_024","Twenty years ago, a Miqo'te of the M tribe traveling with child happened upon their people."
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_025","He claimed to be a nunh who relinquished his title to avoid creating discord within the tribe. Though no longer one of them, he planned to watch over them from afar."
64,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_026","One fateful day, the local wildlife were afflicted with a strange illness that drove them into a frenzy."
65,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_027","It was as if they were possessed, forming a monstrous herd storming toward the Peering Stones."
66,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_028","He could not stand idly by and watch his former home be destroyed. And so he chose to face the beasts alone, leaving his child in the Ananta's care."
67,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_029","One after another the beasts fell as he drove them into a nearby cavern. Yet he would not escape unscathed, for one of the creatures struck him with poison that would soon turn him to stone."
68,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_030","His limbs growing stiff, he used the last of his strength to collapse the cave entrance. The remaining crevice that would have allowed their escape was blocked by his cold, petrified flesh."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_031","That man was M'aht, your father."
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_032","There are those who called him a coward for leaving, but in truth he was the bravest among us."
71,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_033","Do you recall this blade? It has rested here ever since that fateful day your father gave his life to save us."
72,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_034","My father's blade! So it's true, then..."
73,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_035","I hated him for so long, I..."

76,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_040","Why are we fighting here of all places? "
77,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_038","I take it he's asked you to bear witness to our battle. Very well. Pray go to the valley southeast of here. I will be along shortly."
78,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_050","My memories of childhood are hazy, but I do recall being taken to an Ananta village shortly after leaving the M tribe."
79,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_051","Now I know why he left me all those years ago. He was a hero to the bitter end, fighting to protect our people."

84,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_061","M'rahz Nunh, I...I want to apologize for the disrespect I've shown you. You're not to blame for my father leaving. I realize that now."
85,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_062","You needn't apologize. We are men of the M tribe, it is only natural that we might quarrel in one way or another."
86,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_063","Now that you know the truth, what will you do now?"
87,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_064","If you would have me, I wish to rejoin the M tribe. As a tia."
88,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_065","I will become stronger, and one day carry on in my father's footsteps."
89,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_100_065","By his blade, I swear it."
90,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_066","Very well. I welcome you once more as M'zhet Tia of the M tribe. Train hard, young one, and become the man I know your father believed you could be."
91,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_067","I would also hold a memorial service to honor your father's sacrifice. We do not have his remains, but I pray his soul will at last be at peace."
92,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_068","Thanks for all your help."
93,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_069","I might've never learned about my father if you hadn't showed up."
94,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_070","The next time we meet, you'll be addressing me as M'zhet Nunh. At least I hope so. I also expect a rematch for that first thrashing you gave me."
95,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MZHETTIA_000_071","I should get going. I have to reintroduce myself to a lot of people. Till we meet again."
96,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_072","Words fail to express my gratitude, adventurer."
97,"TEXT_STMBDZ724_02827_MRAHZNUN_000_073","He will make a fine nunh someday. When his time comes, I hope you will offer him support again as you did this day."
