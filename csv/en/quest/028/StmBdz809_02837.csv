58,"TEXT_STMBDZ809_02837_ZUZUDESU_000_011","But it is not I who will benefit from your aid, but the good soldiers here in Ala Ghiri. I deliver all manner of supplies, from the armor on their backs to the bread in their bellies. The last thing we need is them marching into battle with empty hands or stomachs."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ809_02837_ZUZUDESU_000_012","And I would be to blame! Why, if you hadn't recovered those crates, I would have had no choice but to flee under the cover of night. Perhaps even assume a new identity. "
