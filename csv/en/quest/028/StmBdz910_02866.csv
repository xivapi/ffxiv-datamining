It's just that the fields where these flowers grow are roamed by creatures which─not to put too fine a point on it─would pull my pretty little head off."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ910_02866_FRAGILEWOMAN02866_000_022","I will take this bouquet and lay it down at the place where we often met in Specula Imperatoris. That was where I worked...and where she was stationed."
