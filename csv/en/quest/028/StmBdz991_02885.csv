1,"TEXT_STMBDZ991_02885_SEQ_01","Speaking with Wichard you learn that he is Gundobald's nephew. The passionate Ala Mhigan lad wishes to contact his uncle and ask for his help in rebuilding their once-great nation. However, as he is too busy to make the journey himself, he asks you to deliver a letter to Gundobald in his place."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ991_02885_SEQ_02","Gundobald is surprised to learn you have brought tidings from his estranged nephew. While he appreciates Wichard's invitation, he explains he has no choice but to decline it and look after those who are unable to leave Little Ala Mhigo. You are asked instead to check if Wichard would be willing to accept those from Little Ala Mhigo that wish to return to their homeland."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ991_02885_SEQ_03","Wichard is saddened to hear he has been refused by his uncle, but enthusiastically agrees to accept anyone that wishes to leave Little Ala Mhigo and join him. He sets about preparing for the group's arrival and bids you tell Gundobald the good news."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ991_02885_SEQ_04","Gundobald is glad to hear his request has been accepted. While some in Little Ala Mhigo are yet to make up their minds, there is a group that is already prepared to make the move to their homeland. Gundobald asks that you speak with him once more should you be willing to aid this group during their travels."
