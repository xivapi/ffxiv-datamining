Most recently, I've been tasked with procuring certain rare supplies, but it's quite beyond one of my humble abilities. Allow me to explain."

58,"TEXT_STMBDZ702_02805_YAGORO_000_014","Alas, the gods were furious that she would bring a lowly mortal to their abode without their permission. And so they destroyed the bridge, reducing it to a thousand thousand pieces, before the nobleman could finish crossing."
