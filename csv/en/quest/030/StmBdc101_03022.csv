1,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_SEQ_01","Lyse is busy apprising you of recent developments in Ala Mhigo when Alphinaud and Alisaie arrive bearing word from Tataru. Apparently, Hancock has acquired information of great interest and no small amount of urgency, leaving you little choice but to set out at once for the offices of the East Aldenard Trading Company in distant Kugane."
2,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_SEQ_02","At the Ruby Bazaar, Hancock shares a tantalizing rumor: that individuals resembling Gosetsu and Yotsuyu were but recently seen walking the streets of Kugane. Though you struggle to comprehend how they could possibly have escaped Doma Castle alive, the fact remains that the Garleans were sufficiently convinced to dispatch a sizable contingent of soldiers to hunt them down. Never one to leave a comrade at an enemy's mercy, you agree to join Yugiri in her quest for the truth."
3,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_SEQ_03","Ever eager to help, Hancock has taken the liberty of employing “one of the finest informants money can buy” to aid in the search. He awaits you in the back streets of Sanjo Hanamachi..."
4,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_SEQ_04","To no one's surprise, the informant turns out to be Gyodo, the Namazu who unwisely betrayed you to the Empire during your first visit to Kugane. Promising no more funny business, he shares a promising lead: an elderly Roegadyn samurai recently sold a katana of surpassing craftsmanship to a pawnbroker on Kogane Dori. While Alisaie accompanies Gyodo to a meeting with his imperial connections, you and the others will seek out the pawnbroker to ascertain whether the weapon in question did indeed belong to Gosetsu."

50,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_LYSE_000_002","Having the Bull of Ala Mhigo at the helm's done wonders for morale. People were dancing in the streets when the announcement was made.

51,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_MNAAGO_000_003","The council has also decreed that we're to maintain a presence at Rhalgr's Reach.

52,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_LYSE_000_004","That's an exaggeration─and I always get up again. Anyway, we can hardly afford to lower our guard now. Not after our latest brush with Lakshmi. Speaking of which, we've been keeping a close eye on the Qalyana, and it looks like they've chosen a new leader."
53,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_LYSE_000_005","It's, um...Shanti's daughter. You know, the half-dead one. For whatever reason, the Qalyana thought she was the best candidate. Which makes them leaderless, basically."

89,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_GYODO_000_069","Alas, see them with my own eyes, I did not. But the imperials are confident. Yes, yes, very confident indeed. Look at the size of their contingent!"
90,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_GYODO_000_070","But here is something they do not know... A rumor which you will find most interesting, I think. They say an elderly Roegadyn samurai appeared on Kogane Dori with a beauteous maiden, and sold his katana to a pawnbroker. 'Twas no common katana either, but one of surpassing craftsmanship."
91,"TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_ALISAIE_100_071","Well, that <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> interesting─assuming it's true. Did you corroborate the rumor with the pawnbroker in question?"

And so <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> will go with our friend here. Nothing improves efficiency like a little supervision."
