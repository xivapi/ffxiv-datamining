2,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_SEQ_02","After a pleasant while spent chatting with your fellow Scions, you are joined by Thancred, who proceeds to share the fruits of his investigation into Zenos's missing remains. Ascian involvement seems all but certain at this point, and Thancred offers to infiltrate the Empire's western provinces to seek out further information. With Y'shtola's time already committed to a scholarly expedition to Doma, Alisaie reluctantly agrees to hold the fort at the Rising Stones."
3,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_SEQ_03","Your companions are poised to scatter to the winds once more. Alisaie stands by the entryway to the solar, a worried frown creasing her brow..."
4,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_SEQ_04","Promising to drop in and visit from time to time, you leave Alisaie to await word from Alphinaud. You can but pray that the light of the Crystal goes with him as he enters a realm steeped in Ascian shadow."

67,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_THANCRED_000_015","After you left, I went about questioning Bloodhowe's gravekeepers. They all told much the same story: once Lyse and her officers had confirmed Zenos dead, his corpse was interred under strict supervision."
68,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_THANCRED_000_016","There seems little reason to doubt their testimony on that point, but when I mentioned the defacement of Zenos's grave, accounts grew rather more vague."

70,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_THANCRED_100_017","Assuming Zenos has not, in fact, risen from the dead, we are left with two possibilities: either the body was disposed of to lend credence to the claims of an extremely committed impostor, or an Ascian has taken up residence within it."
