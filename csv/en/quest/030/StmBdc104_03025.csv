65,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_GOSETSU_000_047","For now, we have taken Yotsuyu to a private chamber and assigned another to watch over her, my lord. But I find it passing strange that the captain should leave his post with nary a word."

72,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_GOSETSU_000_060","We must find Jifuya, and quickly. His disappearance would be cause to worry at the best of times, but that it should coincide with our arrival is more worrying still."

75,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_HANAME_000_071","I, uh... I wondered if I should tell someone, as it happens. He did not look well, you see. I asked if aught was the matter and he told me the past had caught up with him. But I doubt it was that. There are older men in our ranks."
76,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_KAIDATE_000_075","Captain Jifuya? He was headed for the northern entrance when I saw him last. I was going to invite him to train with us, but he did not hear me call out to him."
77,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_KAIDATE_000_076","If you need him, I daresay the sentry on duty will be able to tell you more. Indeed, I suggested as much to Mistress Alisaie when she came asking earlier. Is something amiss?"
78,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_HANAME_000_083","If Captain Jifuya is unwell, it has nothing to do with the past catching up with him, whatever he may think. I should have said as much when he passed by..."
79,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_KAIDATE_000_088","As I keep saying, Captain Jifuya was headed for the northern entrance when I last saw him. If you wish to know where he went after that, you could do worse than ask the sentry on duty."

83,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_RESISTANCE03025_000_091","Aye, the captain went outside some few bells ago─and looking quite unwell, I am sorry to say. This I mentioned to Lord Gosetsu, who straightways struck out after him. I hope they will be all right..."
84,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_ALISAIE_000_092","Gosetsu too? It seems everyone is bent on joining the search."
85,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_ALISAIE_000_093","That's all well and good, but someone has to stay behind. There's no telling what the Empire is plotting."
86,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_ALISAIE_000_094","You go on, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Alphinaud and I shall hold the fort."

88,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_ALISAIE_000_103","Yotsuyu appears to be behaving herself─for now."
89,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_HIEN_000_105","So Jifuya went for some fresh air, did he? Whatever his business may be, I hope you find him soon."
90,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_ALISAIE_000_108","The captain went outside looking quite unwell. Lord Gosetsu has since gone to find him."
91,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_GOSETSU_000_110","He does not appear to have come this way..."
92,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_YUGIRI_000_112","So Jifuya did venture outside. Wherever he is, he cannot yet have gone far."
93,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_ALPHINAUD_000_115","Have you not seen Yugiri? We need everyone present, and urgently."

100,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_GOSETSU_000_140","That her mere presence should sow such strife..."
101,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_YUGIRI_000_143","Lord Hien and Master Alphinaud look troubled... Something is afoot."
102,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_HIEN_000_150","I thank you for your help in the search. Gosetsu has told me all that transpired."
103,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_HIEN_000_152","I would not presume to defend the life Jifuya led before he joined the Front. Nor will I condemn it. Frankly, it is not my place to judge. I will only say this: the Jifuya I know has ever been a man of courage. That he should feel driven to flee bespeaks the depth of his terror. Even now, Yotsuyu casts a shadow over the realm..."
