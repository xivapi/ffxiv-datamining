※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
1,"TEXT_BANNAM000_03096_SEQ_01","You stumble across a terribly dehydrated Namazu in the middle of the desert─a most peculiar sight indeed. Upon confirming that he is likely to survive, you attempt to make an expedient exit. However, a moment's hesitation costs you all plausible deniability. Resigned to facing whatever ordeal lies in store, you stuff the Namazu in your pack at his request, and set off for Yuzuka Manor."
2,"TEXT_BANNAM000_03096_SEQ_02","You unceremoniously deposit the Namazu at the feet of his friend Gyorei. After drinking several times his weight in water, he recovers enough to explain that he is an artisan by the name of Gyoshin, and─though you give no indication of interest─continues on to tell you about his recent unusual dreams. Said dreams evidently include the Namazu's ancestor and a dire warning about the annihilation of their tribe, which can only be averted by holding a seven-year festival on the Azim Steppe. Between this pronouncement and the sudden dramatic entrance of a third Namazu, the self-proclaimed “Seigetsu the Enlightened,” you find yourself in no position to protest as they commandeer your services for this endeavor."
3,"TEXT_BANNAM000_03096_SEQ_03","Naturally, the Namazu require festival grounds before the event planning can proceed. Upon learning of your many heroic deeds in the north, Seigetsu the Enlightened suggests that you introduce the trio to the khatun of the Mol, so they may obtain permission to use unoccupied land in the Azim Steppe for their venue."
4,"TEXT_BANNAM000_03096_SEQ_04","You arrive at Mol Iloh to learn that the wise Temulun has already designated a location for the Namazu's festival. Alas, you are not off the hook yet. The Namazu clearly have a long road ahead if their ideal doom-averting, culturally relevant event is to be realized, and they look to you to provide sorely needed competent assistance─or perhaps just cheap labor. Either way, there is much to be done. Touring the grounds at the Towering Still seems like as good a first step as any."
5,"TEXT_BANNAM000_03096_SEQ_05","With its pavilions windtorn and faded, the erstwhile home of the Dhoro will require significant work if it is to play host to what will surely be a festival like no other. One can only wonder what Gyoshin thinks of this site and the tribulations which lie ahead."
6,"TEXT_BANNAM000_03096_SEQ_06","To your surprise, Gyoshin is more than satisfied with the ramshackle pavilions of Dhoro Iloh, and seems both hopeful for the festival's prospects and eager to set to work. As Gyorei says, he is almost admirable. Almost."
