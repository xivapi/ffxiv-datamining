48,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_GALIENA_000_000","I heard from Aunt Rowena that you're quite the artisan. If that's true, I've got a proposition for you."
49,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_GALIENA_000_001","As I mentioned before, we like to think that our relationship with the people of the Reach is mutually beneficial. We create jobs and opportunities for people to live better lives."
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_GALIENA_000_002","Perhaps you know M'naago, one of the leaders of the Resistance? She not only agrees with what I said, but has even taken a personal interest in the collectables trade."
51,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_GALIENA_000_003","But while I'm sure she's a brilliant soldier with a head for tactics, the collectables market is an altogether different battlefield..."
52,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_GALIENA_000_004","Still, with the help of a few good crafters and gatherers, I'm sure she'll find her footing in no time."
53,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_GALIENA_000_005","That's where you come in─if you want to, that is. Go and see her if you're interested. Or don't."
54,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_GALIENA_000_008","M'naago's just getting her feet wet, so she could use all the help she can get. I won't twist your arm, but if you're worried in the slightest, you should go and see her."
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_010","Good to see you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. If you're looking for Lyse..."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_011","Eh? Who told you I'd taken an interest in the collectables trade?"
57,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_012","...I'm surprised. I knew you were many things, but an accomplished artisan was not one of them."
58,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_013","We would've been fools to turn you away when you offered to help the Resistance, and I'd be a fool to do it now."
59,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_014","You're probably wondering why I decided to try my hand at a different trade. Truth is, it's not for me, but for the ones who couldn't be here today..."
60,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_015","The ones who aren't here to see what we've accomplished. A free Ala Mhigo. A new beginning. A new future."
61,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_016","After we defeated Zenos and the XIIth, I thought long and hard about what I ought to do next."
62,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_017","I was with the relatives of some of the dead in Recompense when I realized...I had lost comrades, but them? They'd lost husbands and wives. Mothers and fathers. Breadwinners. Every day would be harder than the last."
63,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_018","We'd won them freedom, aye. The freedom to be poor and die starving. Where's the justice in that?"
64,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_019","So I decided I'd do something about it. I'd establish a fund for the widows and the orphans─our way of giving a little back in honor of those who gave us their all."
65,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_020","There was just one problem: I don't know the first thing about making gil. Other than soldiering, my only other talent was hunting─and I'll not raise more than a fraction of what I need selling pelts."
66,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_021","But when little Galiena told me about collectables and the prices people were willing to pay, I knew I'd found the answer."
67,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_022","I'll not deny I've got a lot to learn, but I'm ready and willing to give it my all. So what say you? Up for helping me fill custom orders for a good cause?"
68,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_023","'Course, I'll not ask you to do it for free. You'll get your cut─scrips good with any of the House's people."
69,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_024","Glad to have you on board. First order of business: I'm in the market for some Gyr Abanian souvenirs."
70,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_025","Since the liberation of Ala Mhigo, trade with other regions has been steadily increasing. Commodities people had to struggle to get are easier to obtain, and people are getting a taste for more and more─Gridanians in particular."
71,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_026","Heh heh, I've got a feeling this is going to be the start of something special!"
