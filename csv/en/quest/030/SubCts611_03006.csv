81,"TEXT_SUBCTS611_03006_GREDE_000_047","You've all done so much more than you realize. You've changed people, spurred them to strive to be better. Like the young man who's been helping me. Ah, speaking of which..."

88,"TEXT_SUBCTS611_03006_HRUDOLF_000_053","Where else could I go? Apparently the imperials were willing to kill me, and the Resistance weren't like to treat me any better, I reckoned. Best chance I had was to take off my uniform and join this lot."
89,"TEXT_SUBCTS611_03006_HRUDOLF_000_054","Had no idea what had happened, to be honest. Wasn't till later that I learned Commander Kemp himself had died in the battle."
90,"TEXT_SUBCTS611_03006_HRUDOLF_000_055","Didn't know much about the man, other than that he was the leader of the Resistance. That he had a wife named Grede who'd gone into hiding. That he died because he wanted me and my comrades to live."
91,"TEXT_SUBCTS611_03006_HRUDOLF_000_056","I owed him, so I sought her out and did what I could. It'd never make up for it, I knew, but it was better than nothing. A way to pass the time until you found me..."

97,"TEXT_SUBCTS611_03006_MNAAGO_100_060","'Cause sometimes you've got to try <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> hitting the other person back. Otherwise we'll all have bruised knuckles and bloody noses."
