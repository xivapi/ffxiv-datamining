52,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ASAHI_000_002","To be frank, I still am. But I rather doubt the good people of Namai would take kindly to the sight of a man in imperial uniform with blood still dripping from his blade. Even in your company, my presence would only prove a distraction."
53,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ASAHI_000_003","Fret not, however. Thanks to the three of you, I have seen a great deal more than I otherwise would. And with any luck, Lord Hien will have finished considering my proposal by the time we return."

67,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_061","...But I gather your time was well spent. Until the ambassador affords Yugiri a chance to make a full report, however, I must rely on you to supply the details. So please─tell us how it all unfolded."
68,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ALPHINAUD_000_062","The Red Kojin? Here? Have there been any other such incidents since the liberation?"
69,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_063","Only one, that I am aware of. If they are planning some new venture here in Yanxia, we will need to increase patrols."

72,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ALISAIE_000_065","He was. I was quick to doubt him when we first met, but his desire to save them seemed quite genuine. It's possible he truly believes what he's saying."
73,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_066","In the time I've known you, you have always been an excellent judge of character. What do you make of the ambassador?"

75,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_A1_000_001","He may very well be an honorable man."

78,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_070","Oh, how I would love to believe that. An ally within the Empire could change everything. It could give us a real chance at peace."
79,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_075","Then the question of what his true intention may be remains."
80,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_080","He confounds you too, I see. And for that reason alone, we would be fools to underestimate him."
81,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_081","Regardless of his aim, I am resigned to playing his game. For now, at least."
82,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ALISAIE_000_082","Well, forswearing summoning should be simple enough, considering you never dabbled in it in the first place─which just leaves the somewhat thornier question of how to police the Red Kojin."
83,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_083","It was with that very question in mind that I sought Alphinaud's counsel. Thanks to his knowledge of the eikons and the rituals used to invoke them, I believe we've identified a workable solution."
84,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ALPHINAUD_000_084","As you will recall, Susano was summoned forth using the power of relics locked away in the Kojin's treasure vault on the Isle of Zekki. Though said relics remain there to this day, it is all but certain that the act of summoning exhausted their stores of aether making subsequent summonings impossible."
85,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ALPHINAUD_000_085","Assuming that is the case, preventing the primal's return rests on denying the Red Kojin the means to amass new stores of aether, either via the acquisition of crystals or the relics they are wont to collect."
86,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_086","For this, I plan to enlist the aid of our friends the Blue Kojin. Since Doma's liberation, we have forged closer bonds with Bunchin and his people, and with their support, I am quite confident we can keep the Red from obtaining what they require to call upon this Susano."
87,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ALISAIE_000_087","And what of the prisoners?"
88,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_088","They will be exchanged as agreed, and I will give full credit to Asahi for the success of the transaction. If there is aught we can do to help the Populares garner favor, I mean to see it done."
89,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_089","But first, I have some unfinished business to attend to. Would you all come with me?"
90,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_ALISAIE_000_090","Yes, of course, but...what manner of business?"
91,"TEXT_STMBDC107_03028_HIEN_000_091","A past mistake which I would see put right. One which has weighed heavy on my mind..."
