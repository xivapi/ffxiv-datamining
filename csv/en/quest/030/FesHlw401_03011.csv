※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_SEQ_01","It is a day like any other in Gridania, except that a wolfman from Doma has wandered into the city and expressed a desire to join the Continental Circus. Said circus is, of course, no place for any good-hearted individual─beastman or otherwise─and the investigator is desperate to save the Lupin from a life of devilry. For lack of a better plan, he begs you to join the Continental Circus along with the Doman traveler.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_SEQ_02","Soga, the Lupin come from distant Doma, is pleased to make your acquaintance and pleasantly surprised that you do not regard him with fear and uncertainty like so many others. He explains that he wishes to turn his uncommon appearance to his advantage by joining the troupe, where he believes he will be welcomed with open arms and be rich in “nakama” or some such. Yet all who wish to become a member of the Continental Circus must first receive the blessing of the Impresario..."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_SEQ_03","The Impresario is delighted to receive you and Soga, stating that he is more than willing to permit you to join. First, however, you must complete a simple task. To wit, you must frighten several Gridanians for reasons the Impresario is quick to obfuscate. While Soga may use his gods-given gifts to accomplish this, you must rely on other means provided by the Continental Circus: a guise of the werewolf, which you may use to assume a rather more beastly form!"

51,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_INVESTIGATOR03011_000_002","Now, don't get me wrong─it's a fine thing the troupe does, going around Eorzea's great cities and livening up the various All Saints' Wake festivities. But I would never encourage someone to throw their lot in with the fiends!"
52,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_INVESTIGATOR03011_000_003","And that's no exaggeration either. Mark me, friend: they're demons! Honest-to-gods monsters who delight in terrorizing decent folk like you and me!"
53,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_INVESTIGATOR03011_000_004","...Though, to be fair, that mostly amounts to the occasional prank, like stealing your socks or spilling your drink when you're not looking. Still, there's no telling when they'll get a taste for blacker deeds!"
54,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_INVESTIGATOR03011_000_005","I told all this and more to the wolfman, of course, but he just looked at me like I'd been quaffing milkroot all morning. Aye, at this rate, I fear there's nothing we can do to save him from a life of devilry..."
55,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_INVESTIGATOR03011_000_006","Wait, I've got an idea! It's a little convoluted, but...if you and our Far Eastern friend joined the Continental Circus <Emphasis>together</Emphasis>, you could keep him from committing any truly unspeakable evils!"

79,"TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_SOGA_000_045","I wanted to let that adventurer know not to worry about me, so I gave a missive to one of those little postmen earlier. It twirled and said, “Thank you, kupo!”"
