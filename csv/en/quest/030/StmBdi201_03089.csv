2,"TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_SEQ_02","It would seem that Cid has invited an Archon to join him on the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>─a Student of Baldesion by the name of Mikoto."
3,"TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_SEQ_03","Gamely endeavoring to speak in words of fewer than five syllables, the Archon shares her theories on the auracite, prompting a new debate─if the Otius is not a naturally occurring crystal, then who created it and why? Before a consensus can be reached, Ramza foments new tension with his sister by questioning her commitment to the family mission. It is during this fraternal spat that an uninvited guest enters stage right."
4,"TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_SEQ_04","Seeking admission to their theater company, Montblanc, desert moogle from Dalmasca, petitions the Majestic with all the blustery gusto of a born drama queen. Ramza is quick to dismiss him, but in doing so, inadvertently presents Montblanc with a challenge─slay a beast, and earn apprenticeship aboard the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>. Eager to prove his worth, the sorely overmatched and under-armored moogle marches out into the wilds to meet his prey...and most likely his maker."
5,"TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_SEQ_05","Hurdy and Lina have set off in pursuit of Montblanc. Their first stop? Pier #2."

10,"TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_SEQ_10","Hostage-taking apart, the Bangaa mean those of the Theater Company no harm, and merely seek aid in locating their missing captain. After hearing their tale, Mikoto believes that there is a chance Ba'Gamnan may have been manipulated by the Duma in the same manner as the late Argath Thadalfus. With no leads, however, the captain's rescue seems impossible...until Jenomis discovers a mysterious addition on the final page of his journal. Intent on discovering its significance, he returns at once to his research, promising to send for you as soon as the riddle is solved."

Thoughts, memories, feelings, one's very will are all understood to be aetherial phenomena, and can be measured as such. Unlike most crystals, which only can emit elemental energies, auracite is tuned not only to absorb aether, but aether specific to the immaterial.
