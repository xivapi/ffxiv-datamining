※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_01","A delegation led by the inoshishi bugyo has come from the Far East in the hopes of sharing their customs with the people of Eorzea during the coming Heavensturn festival. For reasons unbeknownst to him, however, the people of Limsa Lominsa have failed to show even the faintest glimmer of interest. To that end he turns to you, an adventurer native to Eorzea, in the hopes of winning the townsfolk over. Together with his faithful boar, Ibukimaru, he asks you to spread word of their plans for the festival, and the advent cakes that will be handed out to any who should come to partake in their revelry.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_02","You find Ibukimaru in the company of a potential celebrant, though it is plain he cares not for the boar's affectionate glances. His discomfort soon gives way to enthusiasm, however, when you explain the bugyo's plans for Heavensturn. Before taking his leave, he asks if you are certain about this year's totem animal. As he tells it, word has spread about town that it is the year of the cat. Hopefully this rumor has not yet spread too far."
3,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_03","Ibukimaru's attention is drawn next to a melancholy maiden, all by her lonesome. Upon hearing of the Heavensturn celebration, a glimmer of hope returns to her eyes, for she was all but certain the event had been canceled. She quickly takes her leave, thoughts likely swimming with thoughts of rice cakes, but the cause for her misunderstanding remains a mystery."
4,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_04","You catch up to Ibukimaru and discover him in the company of a rather disgruntled Roegadyn who asks for assistance in doing away with your boar companion. When you tell him Ibukimaru is part of the Heavensturn celebration, he is utterly flabbergasted. It seems someone convinced him the boar had caused a commotion so great the festival was called off. The inoshishi bugyo is sure to take comfort in knowing these untruths have been exposed."
5,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_05","While relieved by your report, the inoshishi bugyo is at a loss as to who would try to sabotage the festival. Enter the neko bugyo. He believes the cat has been denied its rightful place as a totem animal and intends to seek his revenge by ruining this year's celebration. In fact, he claims to have made powerful allies in Eorzea who will help see his plans come to fruition. No sooner does he take his leave than the mochi daikan arrives bearing terrible news. The mochi pounding sites are under siege by strange, feline creatures, and with no mochi for advent cakes, there can be no festival. And so you set out to save the mochi by participating in the FATE “A Mochi Catastrophe” in one of the following locations: southeast of the Zephyr Gate in middle La Noscea; east of the Salt Strand in lower La Noscea."
6,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_06","Amidst flying fur and perilous pounding, you somehow emerge unscathed with sufficient mochi for the bugyo's advent cakes. He is certain to be relieved to hear this."
7,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_07","Thanks to your efforts, the Heavensturn celebration is off to a rousing start, but the neko bugyo is not yet willing to admit defeat. When his gaelicat cohort fails to come to his aid, however, he collapses to the ground, lamenting the shattered dreams of cats everywhere. He begins to reminisce about a simpler time, when all he wanted was to share his love of cats with the world. Suddenly inspired by this stroll down memory lane, he proclaims he will see that dream realized, even if it requires nefarious means to do so. The neko bugyo then takes his leave, vowing revenge against the boar come next Heavensturn. A pity it will not be next year's totem animal. Nevertheless, <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> year's festival is safe, and the people of Limsa Lominsa can celebrate in peace."

50,"TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_BOARMISSIONARY_000_002","I have always found it fascinating that our celebrations of this momentous occasion are so similar, and yet so different. You see, in the Far East it is not a deity, but a totem animal which serves as herald for the coming year."
