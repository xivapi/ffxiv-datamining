1,"TEXT_BANKOB102_01326_SEQ_01","The labor–averse Bo Zu has caught word of generous meals being distributed by Zo Ga to those industrious kobolds who have earned the fugleman's favor, and has concluded that the 789th is equally deserving of gustatory gratification despite their decided lack of productivity. Head to Iron Lake and appropriate three lavish lunchpots so that Bo Zu and his friends can feast like their hard–working peers for a day."
2,"TEXT_BANKOB102_01326_SEQ_02","You have managed to secure three piping hot lunchpots. Deliver the feast to the 789th Order Dig in hopes that it will sate the stomach of the slavering Bo Zu."
3,"TEXT_BANKOB102_01326_SEQ_03","Bo Zu revels in the fruits of your success, though any hopes that the dustman has learned a lesson about the value of hard work are promptly dashed when he shamelessly expresses his eagerness to impose upon you similarly again. You can only hope that the idle–handed kobold's stomach remains sated for the foreseeable future."
