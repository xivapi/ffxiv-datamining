2,"TEXT_GAIUSE204_01348_SEQ_02","Concluding that the other city–states are unlike to accept the refugees, Alphinaud proffers an alternative solution. Rather than petitioning another nation for aid, the Domans might instead travel to the outpost of Revenant's Toll, where they could work as frontier hands in exchange for food and shelter. Though Yugiri is amenable to the idea, the matter of how the refugees would make a journey of so great a distance remains. Believing that the Ul'dahn Adventurers' Guild may be of assistance, Alphinaud departs for the Quicksand and invites you to follow."

Alas, the lack of a ready means of transportation remains an insurmountable obstacle─until Teledji Adeledji generously offers to contract the services of the Seventy-Seven Caravans at personal expense. To ensure that all goes according to plan, Alphinaud bids you meet with Gigiyon, the Seventy-Seven Caravans representative in Scorpion Crossing."
