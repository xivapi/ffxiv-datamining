1,"TEXT_BANSAH002_01375_SEQ_01","Novv is concerned that his foolish son, Pyuu, has set off to reason with the notoriously violent Coral Tridents. With his claws full minding the rest of the clutch, the clutchfather asks that you save his offspring in his stead. Speak with Seww, another of Novv's spawnlings, and learn where you must go to rescue the reckless Pyuu."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH002_01375_SEQ_02","Seww fears that his younger clutchmate, Pyuu, heads to almost certain death at the spears of the Coral Tridents. Make your way towards the Sahagin Landbase found near Halfstone in western La Noscea, and find the wayward spawnling."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH002_01375_SEQ_03","Just as his clutchmate had feared, Pyuu's clumsy attempt to parley with the Coral Tridents has erupted into violence. Defeat the Trident warriors, and extricate the young Sahagin from his unpleasant predicament."
4,"TEXT_BANSAH002_01375_SEQ_04","You have rescued Pyuu from his savage kin. According to the contrite spawnling, he merely wished to practice the teachings of his clutchfather, and did not expect such a brutally dismissive reception. Return to Novv's Nursery and report your success to Novv himself."
5,"TEXT_BANSAH002_01375_SEQ_05","After thanking you for your kindness, Novv explains the dilemma that threatens the future of his race. The clutchfather is adamant that conflict with the “shorewalkers” will only hinder his people's efforts to secure a safe spawning ground in which to raise the next generation of Sahagin. Help bring about a more peaceful future for beastmen and shorewalkers alike by aiding Novv and his clutch in their struggles to contain the Coral Trident fanatics."
