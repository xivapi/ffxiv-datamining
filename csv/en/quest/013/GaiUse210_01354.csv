2,"TEXT_GAIUSE210_01354_SEQ_02","F'lhaminn informs you that the Seventh Heaven is responsible for preparing the meals, and that all should be proceeding according to plan. However, it would seem she too is a proponent of excess caution. You are to speak with Alys to confirm the state of the meals─but not before collecting several bottles of wine which are to be delivered as well."

4,"TEXT_GAIUSE210_01354_SEQ_04","Alys willfully misinterprets your concern as an offer to deliver the meals in her stead, placing them on the counter and waiting expectantly for you to pick them up. Refusing at this point would accomplish little; collect the meals as bade."
