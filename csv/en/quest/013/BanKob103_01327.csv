Travel to Iron Lake and pluck three digits from the hands of the grenades hovering about the area, that you might make amends for the gluttonous dustman's misdeeds."
2,"TEXT_BANKOB103_01327_SEQ_02","Three grenade digits are yours. Deliver them to Ba Go at the 789th Order Dig before he visits flaming destruction upon the rueful Bo Zu."
3,"TEXT_BANKOB103_01327_SEQ_03","Ba Go was already wise to Bo Zu's misdeeds, having suffered similar antics before. He accepts the digits you have procured for him, but has little intention of forgiving his friend. Fortunately for Bo Zu, the acolyte is more concerned with mending his beauties than seeking revenge."
