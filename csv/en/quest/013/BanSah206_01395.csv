1,"TEXT_BANSAH206_01395_SEQ_01","Any egg laid at the Sapsa Spawning Grounds faces the prospect of noxious neighbors, and that is something that Houu would rather avoid. Moon jellyfish are pliant and uncomplaining, and would surely not mind being used to stuff the gas-spraying orifices of noxious barnacles. Stopper five barnacles, and should the territorial Sapsa pugil appear, stop it with something a mite harder."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH206_01395_SEQ_02","You have crammed the jellyfish into the barnacles and taken out the pugil who was ill pleased at your molestations. You have done fine work this day. Before you get too wrapped up in your own self-satisfaction, however, it might be best to head back to Novv's Nursery to tell Houu what has transpired."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH206_01395_SEQ_03","Your barnacle-stuffing having been reported, the talk turns to the future of the Sahagin. Houu has real fear that neglect of the spawning grounds due to war will spell the end of his kind. Should the Sahagin live only for the spawning, as Houu says? Should you? One thing you both can agree on is that war is not the way."
