0,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_00","Thancred wishes to discuss how to proceed with the investigation."
1,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_01","For want of a better idea, Thancred suggests consulting Fufulupa once more. Speak with the Brass Blade and find out if he has aught to offer."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_02","Upon learning that someone within the Brass Blades' ranks may be involved in the crystal thefts, Thancred and Y'shtola devise a plan to lure the thieves into the open. Posing as a courier in possession of crystals, Y'shtola will act as bait, while you and Thancred observe from a distance. Should the thieves appear, you are to subdue them by any means necessary."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_03","Y'shtola's ruse succeeds in drawing the thieves out into the open, but when the trap is sprung, it quickly becomes clear that they will not be taken alive. Left with no other choice, you fight till each lies dead. Report all that has occurred to Y'shtola."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_04","Although the thieves had naught in their possession to indicate their allegiance, Thancred notes that all were Sea Wolves, and that each of them sported distinctive blue facial tattoos. This observation appears to prompt a revelation in Y'shtola, who immediately takes her leave to make inquiries. Having been placed in charge of matters in Thanalan, Thancred invites you to return with him to Horizon and report to Fufulupa."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_05","Fufulupa informs you that the traitorous Brass Blade was identified while you were away, but that the Lominsan-born Sea Wolf subdued the unit sent to detain him and took flight. Though he assures you that his comrades will soon hunt down the fugitive, you wonder if the task might better be entrusted to one more capable. Before you can volunteer, however, Thancred is informed via linkpearl that your services are needed elsewhere."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_YSHTOLA_000_010","Calm yourself, Fufulupa. What is this disturbing possibility of which you speak?"
55,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_FUFULUPA_000_012","I was contemplating as to how the thieves' activities escaped our notice for so long, and then it came to me! What if there is someone among our own ranks conspiring with them─a traitor in our own midst!?"
56,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_THANCRED_000_013","...It would be most unfortunate if your fears proved well founded, Fufulupa."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_YSHTOLA_000_014","Indeed. If, for reasons of security, the Concern decided to transfer the remaining crystals stored in Horizon to another location, their plans would be discovered the moment the Brass Blades were informed."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_THANCRED_000_015","Ah, but such a shipment would surely be well guarded. Would thieves as wily as ours risk open confrontation?"
59,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_YSHTOLA_000_016","Mayhap not. But neither would the Concern be eager to present them with such an obvious target. Nay, they might instead elect to carry out the transfer in <Emphasis>secret</Emphasis>─to entrust the goods to, let us say, a lone Miqo'te miner, traveling without escort so as not to attract undue attention."
60,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_FUFULUPA_000_017","But who─ Ahhh, I <Emphasis>see</Emphasis>! Yes, the Concern may <Emphasis>well</Emphasis> elect to do that.

63,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_THANCRED_000_020","Call me a cynic, but I would be surprised if these thieves lay down their arms and surrender. See that you come prepared to offer them some encouragement."

81,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_FUFULUPA_000_043","Ah...no. I am afraid that will not be possible. Regrettably, he, um...managed to subdue the unit of Blades dispatched to detain him, and made good his escape."
82,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_THANCRED_000_044","Oh, for the love of─ And how did he manage that, exactly? Your men haven't been sampling that somnus we confiscated, have they? <Emphasis>Or was he a giant in disguise</Emphasis>?"
