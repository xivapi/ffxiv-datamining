1,"TEXT_BANKOB101_01325_SEQ_01","After much racking of his hunger–addled brain, Bo Zu has hit upon a plan to procure sustenance with minimal–to–no effort on his own part. To wit: you will bring ore to Camp Overlook under the pretense that you confiscated it from the kobolds' stock, requesting spare rations as reward for your efforts.

3,"TEXT_BANKOB101_01325_SEQ_03","Rightfully unimpressed with your donation, the quartermaster tosses some leftovers from last night's supper your way with a strongly worded suggestion that you bother her no further. Take your sorry haul back to Bo Zu at the 789th Order Dig."
4,"TEXT_BANKOB101_01325_SEQ_04","Bo Zu is overjoyed at your efforts─the unappetizing nature of the meal outweighed by the fact that it was acquired without him lifting so much as a single paw.
