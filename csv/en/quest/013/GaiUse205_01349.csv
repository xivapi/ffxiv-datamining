2,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_SEQ_02","After speaking with Hozan in Vesper Bay, he observes that an experienced adventurer such as you should not be burdened with the kinds of menial tasks he would assign. Nevertheless, he and his people are in need, and he asks that you retrieve a heavy crate at the docks."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_SEQ_03","The crate, while admittedly heavy, is a far cry from some of the more cumbersome objects you have carried over the course of your adventuring career. Return to Hozan and present to him the crate."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_SEQ_04","Upon inspection, Hozan is horrified to discover that the scale armor within the crate was damaged during its long storage. Fortunately, it is not beyond repair─assuming that you can locate and retrieve the four missing scales which slipped through holes in the bottom of the crate. Retrace your steps and search for the scales."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_SEQ_05","With relatively little difficulty, you recover the errant scales. Hozan will be relieved to receive them."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_SEQ_06","Although Hozan is full glad for your help, he remains somewhat withdrawn. Gazing upon his father's armor, he wonders what will become of his people, who have naught but mementos and memories of their homeland..."

53,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_010","Greetings. Alphinaud informed me that a Scion would be arriving to help with the preparations. I am honored to meet you, though shamed as well. A great warrior should not be tasked with such trivialities."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_011","Aye, I knew from a glance what manner of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> you were. I too have some skill at arms, as do many of our people."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_012","Little good it does us when our enemies are the elements and starvation. An act so simple as carrying a heavy crate is beyond the capabilities of our healthiest men, believe it or not."

60,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_022","By the gods, the armor! How could this have happened!?"
61,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_023","'Twas bestowed upon my father for feats of valor. Every scale forged by a master smith, guaranteed to withstand the test of time─or so we thought."
62,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_024","The armor must have shifted within its confines during the long sea voyage. Many scales have come loose, and there are holes in the bottom of the crate...through which the four missing scales I count must have fallen."
63,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_025","It can be repaired in time, but only if we recover those scales. Please, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>, retrace your steps and collect any scales you come across."
64,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_026","Only four scales appear to be missing. If we are fortunate, they but recently slipped through the holes in the crate and are somewhere between here and the docks."

66,"TEXT_GAIUSE205_01349_HOUZAN_000_031","Bless you, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>; I am in your debt. All that remains of Doma now are our mementos and memories."
