1,"TEXT_BANKOB202_01336_SEQ_01","There is a pickman of rare talent in the 59th Order Dig, and 789th Order Craftsman Bo Gu would like him dead for the sin of success─his own as well as that of his associate, 13th Order Fugleman Zo Ga. Oblige him by completing the FATE “The Miner in the Mirror” and presenting the resulting proof of your deed to Bo Gu."
2,"TEXT_BANKOB202_01336_SEQ_02","You deliver the Titan mythrilshield to Bo Gu, though in truth, the craftsman need not have suspected you of reticence. The now-dead pickman was hardly the maestro of the mines that Bo Gu made him out to be, and was a nasty piece of work you were happy to put six fulms under."
