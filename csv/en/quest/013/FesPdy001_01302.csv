※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY001_01302_SEQ_01","As the royal seneschal tells it, a doll contest will be the focal point of this year's Little Ladies' Day. He urges you to participate, suggesting that you speak with Serendipity, mistress of the Goldsmiths' Guild in Ul'dah, about acquiring a doll for the contest.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESPDY001_01302_SEQ_02","As might be expected given the season, the Goldsmiths' Guild already struggles to meet a deluge of doll orders, and cannot accept any further commissions. All hope is not lost, however, as Serendipity appears to have one last trick up her sleeve. Should your heart be set on proving yourself the daintiest doll-dresser in the land, speak with her once more."

49,"TEXT_FESPDY001_01302_BUTLER_000_001","What is Little Ladies' Day, you ask? Why, it is a day when the gentlemen of Eorzea assume the role of seneschals, doting upon the needs of Eorzea's fair maidens who are as princesses for the day."
50,"TEXT_FESPDY001_01302_BUTLER_000_002","The tradition began some three centuries ago with Princess Edvya Thorne of Ul'dah. Mayhap you have heard the tale?"

57,"TEXT_FESPDY001_01302_BUTLER_000_009","The key to this contest is the doll's dressing, so at the very least, you will have a proper foundation for your entry. With a little effort, your own little princess might be judged the most charming in the realm!"
