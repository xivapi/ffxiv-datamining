1,"TEXT_GAIUSE215_01359_SEQ_01","Having made her final assessment of the situation, Merlwyb gives the order for the operation to commence. According to the scout you rescued, the summoning ritual is being held at the beastman aetheryte situated deep within the Sapsa Spawning Grounds. Accompany Y'shtola into the Sahagin lair, and fight your way to the aetheryte."

5,"TEXT_GAIUSE215_01359_SEQ_05","Despite your best efforts, the summoning ritual is completed and Leviathan is come once more. But no sooner did the primal manifest than he bent his course for the open sea. Her voice laden with dread, Merlwyb expresses her fear that Leviathan means to unleash a tidal wave. Speak with her again, that you might better understand the impending danger."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE215_01359_SEQ_06","According to Merlwyb, the destructive potential of Leviathan's tidal wave far surpasses anything that occurs in nature. If the primal is not stopped, whole settlements will be laid waste. But with the Lord of the Whorl already far out to sea, how can such a disaster be prevented?"

52,"TEXT_GAIUSE215_01359_FALKBRYDA_000_004","The men are ready. We but await your orders, Admiral. As predicted, the Sahagin have tightened security in and around the spawning grounds. A frontal assault is like to be met with fierce resistance."
