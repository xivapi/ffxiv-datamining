Brother E–Sumi–Yan fears for their safety, and tasks you with their protection."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_SEQ_02","Joining up with the two Seedseers, you assist them in their battle with hostile forest creatures. Raya–O–Senna bids you seek her out at Camp Tranquil, where she would speak with you further."

Hone your skills, that you might be capable of the task before long.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna upon reaching level 35."

Verily, such import that it would be no overstatement to say that the very fate of Gridania hangs in the balance."

Yet our ceaseless warring and ill treatment of the trees that shelter us have aroused the great one's ire, and it is only by the Quieting─the ritual of which I spoke─that he may be placated."
52,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_ESUMIYAN_000_004","Thus did the two Seedseers set out for Everschade, with nary a guard to accompany them. Therein lies the rub, and the nature of the favor I ask of you."
53,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_ESUMIYAN_000_005","By no means would I question the powers of the Seedseers, but with the great one's anger mounting, the Twelveswood becomes a threatening domain for even the most puissant of conjurers."

66,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_ARUHNSENNA_000_024","Y-You speak madness, Sister! Surely, you have not forgotten that Padjali tradition strictly forbids sharing the teachings with those not of our kind. The power of white magic is far too great to risk it falling into the wrong hands!"
67,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_000_025","And so you would uphold tradition merely for tradition's sake? Even at the risk of incurring the great one's wrath and bringing disaster upon our forest home?"

73,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_000_032","As you no doubt have heard, my brother, A–Ruhn, and I were en route to the Guardian Tree. There, the great one, by whose graces we dwell here, resides."

76,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_000_035","In days of old, the ritual was, without fail, performed by three white mages. With our elder sister occupied with her many duties, my brother and I thought to attempt it on our own. A–Ruhn was quite confident, but I had my doubts..."
77,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_000_036","It was then that <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> arrived, and shortly thereafter became one of the chosen few to be gifted with a white mage's soul crystal. 'Tis no small honor; that gem marks you as an inheritor of the magic of our ancestors."
78,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_000_037","My brother's pride may blind him, but the signs are clear as day to me. You are not Padjali, but A–Towa–Cant meant for you to be here today, to perform the ritual with us."
79,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_100_037","A–Towa–Cant is known to all as one of the greatest mages in our history, but even more so, he was known for being something of an eccentric. In defiance of tradition, he bid farewell to his forest home, wandering the realm and healing the wounds of the land and its people wheresoever he went."
80,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_101_037","A most admirable cause, yes? But alas, A–Towa was never to return. He perished in a far–off land, and having taken no apprentices, his legendary powers were lost to us for eternity. Or so I believed...until I met you."
81,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_000_038","And yet, for all his stubbornness, there is some truth to my brother's words. Ancient laws forbid us from sharing the teachings of white magic outside of our own kind. There are reasons for this, which I would share with you when the time is right."
