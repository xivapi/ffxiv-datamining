1,"TEXT_JOBPLD451_01059_SEQ_01","Through intermediaries, Jenlyns has arranged a parley with Solkzagyl in order to negotiate the return of Oathkeeper. However, the meeting could be a trap, and Jenlyns has asked you to accompany him. The parley will be held south of Forgotten Springs, in the Sagolii Desert."
2,"TEXT_JOBPLD451_01059_SEQ_02","When you arrive at the parley, Jenlyns suddenly turns his sword against you and accuses you of being in league with Solkzagyl and the Monetarists. You have no time to explain or persuade him otherwise, and are forced to fight Jenlyns and his soldiers. Defiant to the bitter end, Jenlyns refuses to believe your pleas of innocence, until one of his own men attempts to take his life. However, Solkzagyl suddenly appears and saves the captain's life, and the man once believed to be a traitor reveals that he has always been loyal to the crown. Although Jenlyns loses consciousness due to his injuries, Solkzagyl assures you that it is nothing serious, and he pledges to deliver him safely back to Ul'dah. Nevertheless, you should see if Jenlyns is well when next you return to the city."
3,"TEXT_JOBPLD451_01059_SEQ_03","Jenlyns has accepted that he was an unwitting dupe of the Monetarists. Now that his true enemy has been revealed to him, he will bide his time until the time is ripe to strike.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Jenlyns upon reaching level 50."

60,"TEXT_JOBPLD451_01059_JENLYNS_000_015","You were, no matter how briefly, a paladin, and as such, you are bound by a code of honor that is as unforgiving as it is noble."

76,"TEXT_JOBPLD451_01059_JENLYNS_000_041","As for me, yes, I am recovered from my wounds, at least those that will heal. But far more important than that, Solkzagyl is innocent, after all."
