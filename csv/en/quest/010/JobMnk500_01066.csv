The professor suspects he may have made for Silvertear Falls in Mor Dhona─the location he believes capable of unlocking the seventh chakra. Find Widargelt and try to speak some sense to him."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK500_01066_SEQ_02","As a result of the epic struggle to deny Widargelt his seventh chakra, it is yours that has fully opened. Speak with the defeated and devastated Widargelt, and see if the veil of vengeance which blinded him has at last been lifted."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK500_01066_SEQ_03","Widargelt gifts you the fifth and final relic, completing your monk's war garb. He has realized the error of his ways, and learned the most important lesson of all from Professor Erik: the true responsibility of the monk is to fight for life, not revenge. Take to heart Erik's words as Widargelt did, and wield your arts so that the realm might one day know peace.

※The next monk quest will be available from Erik once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"
