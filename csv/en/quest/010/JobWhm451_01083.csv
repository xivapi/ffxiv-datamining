1,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_SEQ_01","Distressed at the theft of A–Towa–Cant's ashes, Raya–O–Senna sent her best moogleservant in search of the thieves. Having now returned, speak with Kupcha Kupa and see if his search has borne fruit."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_SEQ_02","Kupcha Kupa informs you that one of his kind caught sight of an urn being carted away by a band of Redbelly Wasps. Venture to the bandits' den northwest of Quarrymill in the South Shroud, and speak with the moogle eyewitness, Pukno Poki."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_SEQ_03","Pukno Poki tells you that he saw the bandits haul the urn off toward Redbelly Hive on a wain carelessly overloaded with stolen loot. Carefully navigate your way around the skulking Redbelly Wasps and recover the stolen remains."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_SEQ_04","After tracking down the overloaded wain and dispatching a trio of Redbellies, you have successfully recovered the remains of A–Towa–Cant. Return them to Raya–O–Senna at Camp Tranquil."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_SEQ_05","Though relieved at the return of the great mage's remains, Raya–O–Senna has unfortunate news for you. Uprooted from their resting place, the ashes have been drained of their powers, rendering them unsuitable for enchanting your garb. She asks you to continue your training while she consults her brother as to the best course of action.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna upon reaching level 50."

54,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_KUPCHAKUPA_000_012","Of course, you have not come to discuss my mistress's temper, but the grave robbery. A most unforgivable act of villainy, if I do say so myself─which I believe I just did, kupo!"
55,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_KUPCHAKUPA_000_013","I am pleased to say─and you will be pleased to hear─that the culprit did not escape moogle eyes, kupo!"
