1,"TEXT_JOBDRG500_01072_SEQ_01","Ser Alberic has received a message from Estinien, who intends to strike against Nidhogg straightaway. Travel with Ser Alberic to the Steel Vigil, that you might share the truth of Ferndale with the young dragoon before the battle is joined."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG500_01072_SEQ_02","You and Ser Alberic locate Estinien, but the fugitive dragoon has already learned the truth of the past on his own. Enraged at what he perceives to be Ser Alberic's failure to defend his home, Estinien turns upon you. Your virtuous spirit and mastery of the lance, however, prove more than a match for your adversary, and the being of darkness vanishes from sight, taking the fallen dragoon with it. Return to the Observatorium to hear Ser Alberic's thoughts on the matter."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG500_01072_SEQ_03","Shaken but no worse for the wear, Ser Alberic welcomes you back. Nidhogg's aura now subsided, his scalekin will return to slumber for the time being. Though concerned for Estinien's fate, Ser Alberic is heartened by your accomplishments, which give him newfound hope for the future. Until such time as the great wyrm wakes again, go forth as the Azure Dragoon and use your newfound strength in the name of justice.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"

49,"TEXT_JOBDRG500_01072_ALBERIC_000_002","It appears you have not yet fully become master of the dragon within you, and yet we are racing against time. I fear we have no choice but to do battle to the best of your current abilities, and without the drachen mail I promised."

55,"TEXT_JOBDRG500_01072_ESTINIEN_000_014","As I understand it, you've kept even the archbishop in the dark regarding the missing Eye. Do you mean to take your shame to your grave?"
