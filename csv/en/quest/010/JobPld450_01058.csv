1,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_SEQ_01","Jenlyns has uncovered archived records that point to a link between Solkzagyl and a faction within the Syndicate known as the Monetarists. While he continues his search for the missing traitor, Jenlyns assigns to you another trial. You must seek out the four pieces of the gallant armor, which have been scattered throughout southern Thanalan. The coffers containing each piece will be guarded by the Sultansworn, whom you must first defeat if you are to claim the armor."
2,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_SEQ_02","You have crossed blades with the Sultansworn's finest and emerged triumphant. Bear word of your accomplishments back to Jenlyns at Ul'dah's Hustings Strip."
3,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_SEQ_03","Jenlyns at last declares you ready to face Solkzagyl. While you were gone, he succeeded in making contact with the traitor, and the two of them have agreed to meet. When your preparations are complete, speak with Jenlyns to proceed to the parley."

48,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_001","Well come, friend. I have important news for you. In my search for the traitor, I have been looking through old records─and discovered something chilling."
49,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_002","Around the time the traitor Solkzagyl was named captain, several famed soldiers of the Sultansworn met with untimely deaths. But strangely, our records do not say how they died."
50,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_003","Curious, I begged the favor of an old friend and received permission to inspect medical records kept by Frondale's Phrontistery. I discovered that the soldiers died in various ways─some in combat, some suddenly at night, in the barracks... But in nearly every case, there were signs that poison had played a role in their demise."
51,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_004","Yes, poison. Carefully, invisibly administered. The more I read, the more I saw the dark hand of Death's Embrace at work─assassins in the pay and service of the Monetarists. A society so secretive that few believe it truly exists."
52,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_005","But no matter how skilled and devious the assassins, they should not have been able to kill so many of the Sultansworn elite without being discovered. Not, that is, without help from within our own ranks."
53,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_006","So I asked myself: who had the most to gain from their deaths? One by one, the former captain, his trusted aides, the most capable of the Sultansworn who might become future commanders─all of them, slain by an invisible hand. And with their deaths, the way was open for Solkzagyl to become the Sultansworn's youngest captain in a century."
54,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_007","The Monetarists were plotting to kill the best and bravest of the Sultansworn, to purge its ranks of greatness, and enervate it so that it could no longer carry out its duty to serve as sword and shield of the sultanate."
55,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_008","Which begs the question: how did Solkzagyl remain captain for thirty long years? How did he avoid the poisoner's kiss, when men better than him had succumbed? There can be only one explanation─he was the Monetarists' cat's-paw, the turncloak in our midst."
56,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_009","Needless to say, I am more determined to track him down than ever before. While I continue my investigation, I have a trial for you. I want you to seek the gallant armor, the legendary raiments worn by generations of the finest soldiers of the Sultansworn."
57,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_010","In accordance with Sultansworn tradition, the set that would be yours has been scattered across southern Thanalan. Each piece has been locked within a coffer, which will be guarded by two men. You must best the Sultansworn themselves if you are to claim their armor."
58,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_020","Good, the armor is yours. You have learned your lessons well and honed your skills, and now you are ready to face Solkzagyl the traitor."
59,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_021","Yes, the time has come. I have discovered his hiding place, and made contact through emissaries. We are negotiating the return of Oathkeeper."
60,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_022","Secrecy is crucial─as is preparation. We will leave only when you are ready."
61,"TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_POP_MESSAGE","Men in shimmering white armor beckon to you..."
