1,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_01","Professor Erik has entrusted you with two tasks, the first of which is to collect the aetherometer in the possession of Widargelt. Travel to Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan and there speak with the monk."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_02","Widargelt urges you to set about your second task, assuring you that he will bring you his aetherometer when it has finished collecting data. Travel to Snakemolt in the South Shroud and make use of your aetherometer at the designated location."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_03","You have collected the data Professor Erik requested. Retrieve the aetherometer."
4,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_04","Widargelt confesses that his sole purpose is to learn the locations of ancient battlefields from Professor Erik, so that he may travel to them in order to further open his chakra. In doing so, he hopes to serve the Ala Mhigan Resistance to the utmost of his ability. Return to the Goldsmiths' Guild and deliver both your and Widargelt's aetherometers to the professor."
5,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_05","Upon a cursory examination of the aetherometers, Professor Erik is excited by the prospective results they might yield. Continue in your monk's training as he sees about analyzing the latest haul of data.

※The next monk quest will be available from Erik upon reaching level 45."

49,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_001","I speak of the data you procured! It is simply marvelous! You have a true gift for grunt work, my friend. I wish I had a hundred more assistants just like you."
50,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_002","I have been in this field for a very long time, and I have been alone. Ever since that unfortunate mulled tea fungus culture incident sparked my passion for research. I regret nothing, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."

53,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_005","I made yet another career-defining discovery while pondering which battleground to measure next. Eorzea is home to numerous locations where the aether is in an intensely chaotic state, yet which never played host to any war."
54,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_006","My hypothesis was that such flux in the aether was indicative of a past battle, and all my research was predicated upon this."

56,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_008","I have already sent the simpleton monk to take measurements at the Finesand Banks. As you are doubtless unaware, this lies on the border between Ala Mhigo and Gridania, and was the stage of the Autumn War."
57,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_009","I ask that you find our monk friend and collect his aetherometer. Manual and tedious, yes, but he has an early make of the device that is unable to transmit data. I gather the numskull is in Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan by this time."
58,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_010","You think I ask much of you? False! I ask more. Your other task is to travel to Snakemolt in the South Shroud, and there take measurements with your own aetherometer."

79,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_WIDARGELT_000_032","The Resistance here is small. They aid where they can. But it is not enough. This war demands great power. That power lies in the chakra."

88,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_041","All looks to be in order here. Hmmm... These readings from your device...they look promising. Very promising, indeed. I daresay this data may yield revolutionary results!"
89,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_042","Hm? Your chakra opened a bit more, did it? Yes, well, aether is a most mysterious and wonderful thing. I am glad this meaningful research could serve your nonsensical ends as well."
90,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_ERIK_000_043","Now, leave me to my work. Surely you can find some simple way to pass the time. Fighting, say? Or...I don't know─scratching?"
