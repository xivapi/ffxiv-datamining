56,"TEXT_JOBBRD451_01089_JEHANTEL_000_005","The attire was entrusted to me when Pukno Poki and I first met, deep within the Twelveswood. The moogle and I had traded scarce more than a handful of words when he proffered to me the attire along with the Soul of the Bard."
57,"TEXT_JOBBRD451_01089_JEHANTEL_000_006","At that time, I knew not the true power of song, and so declined the gifts...but Pukno Poki would not be denied. For all his good humor, the moogle can be as unmoving as a rock. “The attire chooses the wearer, not the other way 'round,” he insisted, and I found myself yielding to his will."

62,"TEXT_JOBBRD451_01089_JEHANTEL_000_011","Determined that I would not be proven wrong, I went to great pains to ensure that the attire would never again see the light of day, and the pieces now rest in places of peril. Being the proud fool that I was, it never crossed my mind that mayhap another was meant to don it."
63,"TEXT_JOBBRD451_01089_JEHANTEL_000_012","I would entrust the choral attire to you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.
