Travel to Costa del Sol and rendezvous with your guildmate Solkwyb."
2,"TEXT_JOBWAR300_01049_SEQ_02","Solkwyb explains that Costa del Sol has been beset by a fearsome horde of turtles, and that the creatures seem to be originating from the northern shore. Investigate any possible cause of the beasts' burgeoning numbers."

4,"TEXT_JOBWAR300_01049_SEQ_04","Solkwyb suspects that Curious Gorge's true identity is that of a gifted young marauder who disappeared when the Company of Heroes was disbanded. Should you wish to train in the lost art of the warrior, seek out Curious Gorge at Hidden Falls."
5,"TEXT_JOBWAR300_01049_SEQ_05","Duly impressed by your strength, Curious Gorge presents you with the Soul of the Warrior. When your inner beast awakens, he explains, the runes will resonate, granting you such strength as you never thought possible. Hone your skills until such time as Curious Gorge can decipher the chronicles of his ancestors that he carries with him, and thereby continue your training.

※The next warrior quest will be available from Curious Gorge upon reaching level 35."
