With the deaths of his companions weighing heavily on his soul, Jehantel could never again summon the will to bend back his bow. He also regrets exposing you to danger, but nevertheless has a further request to make of you. Speak with the bard once more when you have steeled your resolve."

49,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_001","Very well. The time is ripe that I teach you the Ballad of the Vainglorious Fool."
50,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_002","The song tells the tale of an archer of the Gods' Quiver whose peerless skill was surpassed only by his hubris."
51,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_003","Alas, that hubris led to the annihilation of his entire regiment at the battle which has come to be called the Massacre of Griffin Crossing. Ahem!"

An archer, wearying of the sight,♪"

Forsook his post to claim victory.♪"

When shrieks rang out whence his comrades slept,♪"
55,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_007","For he was not there to see the knives,♪
Nor to ring the bell and save friends' lives.♪"

58,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_010","As before, I'd sooner have you demonstrate the fruits of your learning with bow in hand. This time, however, you shall have the pleasure of my company."

69,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_034","By that most basic of criteria, I was unfit to hold a bow from the first."
70,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_035","In my pride and lust for glory, I sent countless souls to a bloody grave─good men and women all, with loved ones and bright futures awaiting them.

73,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_038","On that note, let us conclude the lesson. I daresay I have no cause to worry that you will repeat the selfsame mistake as the vainglorious fool."

76,"TEXT_JOBBRD450_01088_JEHANTEL_000_041","...And yet, there is more I would ask of you. If you would do me the kindness of lending your ear, then pray speak now."
