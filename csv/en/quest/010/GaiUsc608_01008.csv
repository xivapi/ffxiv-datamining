51,"TEXT_GAIUSC608_01008_CHANSTELOUP_000_010","The ghost knight? Aye, I saw him. Clad from head to toe in armor that seemed forged from shadow itself, galloping through the Shroud atop his hells-born steed."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSC608_01008_CHANSTELOUP_000_011","Mark my words─the trees themselves were quivering in fear that night. I've not slept a wink since I returned."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSC608_01008_TATASOSA_000_021","Forgive me─ever since espying a glimpse of that ghastly horseman, my heart won't stop racing. I knew the elementals would punish us sooner or later for daring to disobey their will. This is surely a sign of sinister happenings to come."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSC608_01008_HONORAINT_000_030","Aye, saw him clear as day─or clear as night, ye might say─with me own two eyes. More fearsome than the rider was his ghastly steed─I know not where ye've traveled, but I can assure you ye've not seen more frightenin' a beast. One thing I can tell ye, friend─that was no specter or shadow. Nay, he was as solid as you or me."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSC608_01008_AEDAN_000_040","Yes, I saw the black knight─after which I promptly fled for my dear life. Should you end up in my position, you'd be wise to do the same."

58,"TEXT_GAIUSC608_01008_LEWIN_000_050","A knight clad in shadow-forged armor. A mammoth sword and hells-born steed. It is clear now─our worst forebodings have proven most unfortunately prescient."
