1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ504_01839_SEQ_01","The meandering moogle has taken his medicine and is well on the mend, but one thing hampers his recovery─his concern for his fluffy friend, who has not yet returned from his moca-gathering expedition. He bids you return to the Monsterie and bring the mercurial moogle back to Moghome."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ504_01839_SEQ_02","You find the mercurial moogle hiding from a swarm of vicious vilekin. You do away with the insects, freeing the moogle to return to his friend's side. Follow the mercurial moogle back to Moghome to check on the patient's progress."

I bet our mercurial friend here thinks it's his return that's done the trick and not my marvelous medicine, kupo! Though I suppose we wouldn't have either if it wasn't for you..."
