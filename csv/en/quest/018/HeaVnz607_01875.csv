1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ607_01875_SEQ_01","Mogzun has given you the exciting news that a moogle named Mogoon is giving away weapons that once belonged to the landlords. Visit the area near the Mother of the Sheave statue for more information on this exciting giveaway."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ607_01875_SEQ_02","After speaking to Mogoon, you find out that his giveaway was a farce, meant only to get annoying visitors to go away so he can pay his respects in silence. However, moogles are not the only thing proving to be a nuisance. He asks you to slay three of the dragons in the area so that he might have the peace he desires."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ607_01875_SEQ_03","You have slain the dragons, and the area becomes noticeably quieter. Return to Mogoon with news of your deed."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ607_01875_SEQ_04","Mogoon is pleased that he can finally show his reverence to the Mother of the Sheave in silence. The statue is made in the image of Shiva when she fell in love with the great wyrm Hraesvelgr, so it should be treated with the utmost respect."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ607_01875_MOGZUN_000_001","...That's right, it's a weapon of the fabled landlords! Mogoon was kind enough to give it to me─for free! If you want one for yourself, go visit him near the Mother of the Sheave statue!"
