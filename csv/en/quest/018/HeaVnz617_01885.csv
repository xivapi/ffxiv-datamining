0,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_SEQ_00","Ingaret seems somewhat uneasy."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_SEQ_01","Rumor has reached Ingaret that someone has seen sorbets somewhere in the local area. Verify whether or not these rumors are true by finding the person who sighted these creatures and confirming their story."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_SEQ_02","You speak with Tourcenet and he assures you that he saw sorbets at Red Rim. They should be dealt with quickly, before they get out of hand. Travel to Red Rim and slay some of the beasts to keep their numbers in check."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_SEQ_03","You have killed four of the monsters. That should keep them under control for the time being. Return to Ingaret and let her know that the rumors were true."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_SEQ_04","Ingaret thanks you for both confirming the rumors and slaying several of the sorbets, too. Sorbets do not normally live in this area, and Ingaret is unable to offer any explanation as to why they are there. She does seem to have a hunch─one she chooses not to disclose."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_INGARET_000_002","Please look into this for me. Whoever saw the creatures must be around here somewhere. See if you can find them and confirm their story."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_INGARET_000_010","Try and find whoever it is that spotted sorbets in the area. They reproduce quickly, so if these rumors are true, we'll need to kill them off quickly."

53,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_TOURCENET_000_021","But we can't just let them be. Those things multiply so quickly, so it won't be long before the snowfields are filled with those disgusting creatures.

55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ617_01885_INGARET_000_030","So there really were sorbets nearby? Thank you for thinning their numbers. That should keep them in check long enough for us to send a squad to make sure they're fully eliminated. I shall have to notify Ser Redwald immediately."
