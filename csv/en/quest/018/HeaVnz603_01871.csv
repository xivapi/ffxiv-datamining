1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_SEQ_01","With her mission complete, Maenne makes preparations to return to Ishgard, but not before requesting one more thing of you. She asks that you deliver the sealed crate containing the aetherometers as well as the observation log from the northeast scout to Commander Handeloup at the Congregation. Your first task is simple: obtain the sealed crate not far from where Maenne is."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_SEQ_02","The sealed crate is heavier than it looks, but you manage to collect it nonetheless. Proceed with the second part of Maenne's request and obtain the observation report from the scout to the northeast."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_SEQ_03","You arrive to where the scout is posted to find out that he has already written the report of his observations. However, he will remain behind with the rest of the scouts to continue their work until Maenne calls for them. Return to the Congregation and give Commander Handeloup the items you have collected."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_SEQ_04","Handeloup is pleased that the survey was completed without any major incidents, but expresses concern that transformed heretics still exist. It seems that he wants to learn more of the history and environment of the Churning Mists, so that more light can be shed on the time when dragons and mankind purportedly lived together. He asks that you act as an intermediary and use your relationship with the moogles to convince them to hear out his request. Speak with Moglin to see if he would be inclined to help the curious Ishgardians."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_SEQ_05","Moglin seems willing to teach the knights from Ishgard of the history of his land, on one condition: the war between mankind and dragonkind must come to an end. He sends members of the Pomguard to meet Ser Handeloup, and bids you follow them as well. Speak with Mogkul of the Pomguard once you reach the party at the Rookery."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_SEQ_06","You meet Ser Handeloup, Maenne, and the moogles of the Pomguard, and after a short conversation they come to an amicable agreement. Ser Handeloup will do what he can to convince the Holy See to send carpenters and stonemasons to teach the moogles how to mend the stone structures of Zenith with their own paws. In return, the moogles will share what they know about the Churning Mists. With this, mankind and mooglekind will work together and attempt to repair the damage of the past and rebuild what has been lost."

52,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_MAENNE_000_003","I shall inform my scouts at each location that our mission is complete, then we shall return to Ishgard together. Once again, you have my thanks─we would not have been able to finish our mission without you."

55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ603_01871_REMAINSINVESTIGATOR01871_000_011","The other scouts and I will remain behind at this post and continue with our work until Maenne calls for us. Give Ser Handeloup our regards, adventurer."
