1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ315_01807_SEQ_01","Incursions by the Gnath into Vath territory continue to trouble the Vath fleetfoot. Lacking sufficient warriors to adequately guard their borders, he asks you to patrol the area near the Stained One and slay any Gnath that may be hiding there."

3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ315_01807_SEQ_03","The fleetfoot is relieved that the Vath borders are safer now. You learn that the Gnath generally consider those who lose their link to the Onemind an aberrant impurity, and attempt to eliminate them. Loth ast Vath is the only safe haven for those who no longer share a consciousness with the hive, and this is why it must be protected."
