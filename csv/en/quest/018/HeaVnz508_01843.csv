1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ508_01843_SEQ_01","Mogeuge tells you how the elder wyverns have been amassing their forces below his lookout spot in preparation for an all-out attack. His nerves frayed by the constant vigilance required of his position, he begs your assistance to delay the wyverns' plans. Drop down to the Four Arms and slay four elder wyverns, buying Mogeuge some time to rest his weary mind."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ508_01843_SEQ_02","You slay the requisite number of elder wyverns, thereby postponing their attack. Return to the top of the Asah ruins and report your success to Mogeuge."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ508_01843_SEQ_03","Mogeuge is relieved to hear that you have thinned the elder wyverns' ranks. The moogle has been in constant fear of the dragons ever since Nidhogg's roar drove them into a frenzy. However, your kind assistance has bought the fraught moogle a few hours of rest and relaxation."
