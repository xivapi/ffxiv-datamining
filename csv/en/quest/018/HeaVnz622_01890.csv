1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ622_01890_SEQ_01","Margyt has been reviewing the report of the scout who survived the recent dragon attack. Judging by the fang you recovered from its body, the dragon you slew does not match the dragon in the report. Furthermore, many of the soldiers that reportedly fell to the dragon are still unaccounted for. Their bodies have likely been eaten by the beasts that inhabit the mountains. Kill the slate yetis near the site of the attack and recover evidence of the troops' demise, such that their families may have closure."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ622_01890_SEQ_02","You recover several scraps of chainmail from the yetis at Red Rim. Judging by the state of the armor, it seems unlikely that the owners were alive when it was removed. Deliver it to Ayleth at Falcon's Nest so that it can be delivered to the Holy See."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ622_01890_SEQ_03","You find Ayleth at Falcon's Nest. She seems frustrated by being assigned so petty a mission, but she assures you that the soldiers' effects that you found will be delivered to their families. Report back to Margyt at the Convictory."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ622_01890_SEQ_04","Margyt thanks you for your work. Once Ayleth returns from Falcon's Nest, Margyt plans to review their tactics and techniques to improve their odds in future attacks on the Dravanian Horde."
