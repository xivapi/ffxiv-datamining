Although you have no food to give him, you notice he makes mention of people living in the Chocobo Forest. Search for the forest's residents, and see if you can find a meal Toh Y Thrah may enjoy."

You speak with Leonulfe, the chef of the seemingly delectable dish, and he agrees to share some with you. In return, he asks that you obtain chocobo meat that he can prepare another serving for later. Slay a wild chocobo for its meat."
