1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ322_01814_SEQ_01","Gullinkambi would task her child, Kal Myhk, with today's hunt, but he has yet to return home. She asks that you find him, and relay her words to him."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ322_01814_SEQ_02","You find Kal Myhk not far from Anyx Trine. In trying to ascertain what manner of being you are, he comes to the erroneous conclusion that you are an enemy from Ishgard, and flees in a panic. Search for Kal Myhk, and deliver his mother's message."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ322_01814_SEQ_04","You find Kal Myhk, but this time he refuses to run away. He stands his ground, prepared for the worst, but is caught by surprise to hear you bring word from his mother. Before you can relay this message, however, he insists on testing you. He asks you to catch him as he flies off to parts unknown. Track down Kal Myhk, and deliver his mother's message. "

Convinced you will not find him again, he challenges you to find him one last time. Track down Kal Myhk, and deliver his mother's message."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ322_01814_SEQ_06","You find Kal Myhk, this time out in the open near the entrance to Anyx Trine. He is impressed that you were able to keep up with him, and decides you will make a good partner. For what, exactly, only he knows. But with games of hide-and-seek finally over, you can at last tell him of his mother's request."
