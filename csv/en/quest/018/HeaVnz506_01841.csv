1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ506_01841_SEQ_01","Mogmont's sense of duty has been highly offended by a brazen dragon who has built a nest just outside Zenith. The dutiful moogle bids you steal an egg from this nest, but does not say for what purpose. Go to the plaza in front of Zenith and take the egg from under the dragon's snout."
