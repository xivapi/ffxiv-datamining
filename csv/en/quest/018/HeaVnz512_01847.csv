1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ512_01847_SEQ_01","It appears that the absent-minded Mogson has left his baskets behind again, this time in Tharl Oom Khash. Recover them for the poor moogle so he can stop fluttering about in distress."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ512_01847_SEQ_02","You find the baskets scattered around Tharl Oom Khash, and it is a mystery how the tiny moogle expected to carry them back in the first place. Return to Mogson and deliver his precious baskets back to him."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ512_01847_SEQ_03","Mogson is delighted to have the baskets returned to him, grateful that he can resume crafting with the crystals stored inside the baskets. It seems that a distant dragon's roar scared the moogle off while he was gathering the crystals. Now, thanks to you, the nervous moogle can resume crafting whatever it is he makes."
