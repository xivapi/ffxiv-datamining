1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ611_01879_SEQ_01","Maenne's scouts have reported several locations that appear to have been host to ancient battles, and have been tasked with obtaining readings of the sites' aetheric levels. However, the scouts scarce have the time to take accurate readings on account of the dragons stalking the area. Maenne asks you to help the scouts and bids you meet the scouting party near Sothton Walls. Speak with the southern scouting party dragoon to see what he requires."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ611_01879_SEQ_02","The diresaurs that hulk about the area are proving to be a nuisance, preventing the scouting party from securely setting up their aetherometers. Distract them and slay three of the beasts so the dragoons can set up the aetherometers undistracted."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ611_01879_SEQ_03","Your fight against the diresaurs provides much-needed exercise for you, and a much-needed distraction to the beleaguered dragoons. Return to the scouting party dragoon and confirm that they were able to safely set up their aetherometers."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ611_01879_SEQ_04","The dragoons were able to set up the aetherometers without incident, and express some regret that they are unable to see you fight for longer."
