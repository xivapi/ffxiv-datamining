1,"TEXT_HEAVNC105_02235_SEQ_01","Old habits are hard to break, as Emmanellain soon proves. Upon realizing that his brother asked you to look after him, the young lord proceeds to press you into duty, bidding you patrol several locations outside Falcon's Nest where wolves have been sighted. Before you can voice your opinion on the matter, Emmanellain vanishes, leaving you with little choice but to carry out the menial task."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNC105_02235_SEQ_02","As expected, there were wolves, and as expected, they were no match for you. With luck, Emmanellain will have returned to his post by now."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNC105_02235_SEQ_03","After congratulating you on a job well done, Emmanellain proudly announces that he has completed his rounds of Falcon's Nest and that yes, all is indeed well. In passing, he mentions that he spoke with Thancred─or the “grizzled fellow” who “made that arsonist confess,” as he puts it─while you were away, and that he employed the same devious techniques on him that he used to press you into wolf-slaying duty. With a sigh, you turn your attention to the wastes outside Falcon's Nest once more."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNC105_02235_SEQ_04","You find Thancred, as well as two heretics he seemingly saved from a ravenous wolf pack. Together, you return to Falcon's Nest, eager to see what other thrilling tasks Lord Emmanellain has in store."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNC105_02235_SEQ_05","Emmanellain has only praise for you and Thancred. “Gallant heroes” by whose “selfless sacrifice” the safety of the conference's guests has been guaranteed. Flattering as his words are, you cannot help but sense a mocking edge, and you suspect Thancred does as well, given the grinding of his teeth."
