1,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_SEQ_01","You happen upon Rowena just as two unexpected visitors arrive. The first is an earnest young researcher bearing an urgent request, the second, Gerolt the ale-sodden blacksmith. Wasting no time, the researcher, one Ardashir, declares that he has been conducting research into the creation of artificial life─something he refers to as “anima.” Though all of his trials have thus far ended in failure, he is convinced that the Sharlayans' work on arcane sentries holds the key to success. Before he can continue with his suit, however, Gerolt decries him for his lack of imagination, and wryly suggests fusing the anima with a weapon─a proposal which Ardashir considers a stroke of genius. Never one to miss a chance to turn a profit, Rowena sets about persuading Gerolt to take part in the venture, and before you know it, you too have been roped in to test the finished product. You are to rendezvous with Ardashir and Gerolt in Azys Lla, where the pair will apparently be working."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_SEQ_02","You find Ardashir in Azys Lla marveling at the technological wonders of the once-great Allagan Empire. Now that you have arrived, he is ready to begin work on the anima weapon."

60,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_011","Very well. If only to explain myself to Rowena."
61,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_012","Together with my master, I have been conducting research into the manipulation of spiritual and aetheric energies in what you call the Near East. Our work has shown that the soul is in fact an agglomeration of a specific type of force. This force defines the quiddity of man and makes us who we are."
62,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_013","While the soul is indeed inimitable, we believe it possible to create a quasi-soul. Thus we turned our attention to anima─the selfsame force which allows individuals to traverse the Lifestream via aetherytes. By infusing a soulstone with the requisite quantities of aether, this force may be harnessed."
63,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_014","Yet after years of research and experimentation, we have naught to show for it but inert husks of stone. We repeated the process again and again, adjusting every element, but the result was always the same. At length, my master declared the project a failure, and turned his thoughts to other matters."
64,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_015","But I could not give up! Not after witnessing the beauty of anima. Not after coming so close. And that is why I have journeyed hither to Eorzea."
65,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_016","I am certain that with the Sharlayans' knowledge of arcane sentries, I can complete my project. I am also certain that the resultant souls will be worth more to mankind than the ale-soaked dishclout that passes for yours!"
66,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_GEROLT_000_017","Finished, have ye? Well then, <Emphasis>allow me to retort</Emphasis>. Seems to me yer a cockered little brat as speaks a lot without sayin' aught. Ye talk like a man o' learnin' when 'tis plain yer just a boy what's never had a thought o' his own, and couldn't even if he tried─not that ye ever would, o' course."
67,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_GEROLT_000_018","And why? 'Cause the youth of today can't be bothered to do an onze of honest work for 'emselves. No sense o' duty. Things get rough, and ye run fer help, leavin' a trail o' piss in yer wake."
68,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_GEROLT_000_019","D'ye reckon them scholarly folks from Sharlayan asked for the answer whenever they got stuck? Not bloody likely! 'Cause they used their bloody brains!"

73,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ROWENA_000_022","Quite an interestin' proposition, Gerolt. One that could be quite lucrative. Why not help poor Ardashir here with his work an' see what you can make of it?"
74,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_GEROLT_000_023","Help that spineless streak o' piss? Yer jokin', ain't ye? Why in the seven hells would I play nursemaid to a watery-eyed brat like him? I was just spoutin' shite! I didn't really <Emphasis>mean</Emphasis> none of it!"
