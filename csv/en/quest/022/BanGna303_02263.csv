Luckily, the Vath have a potent insect repellent for just such an occasion. He asks that you make for Tailfeather with great haste to dispel these horrid pests. First, you must speak with the Vath kintamer to mount a kongamato equipped with vilekin repellent.

He thanks you all the same, and asks that you make one more stop before returning to Loth ast Vath. These insects are quite persistent in their search for gysahl greens, and have gone so far as eating them from traps in the Chocobo Forest. He asks that you fumigate those greens as well before there is nothing left of their traps."
