0,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_SEQ_00","Lucia is concerned that you seem to be looking for something to do."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_SEQ_01","Resigned to the simple truth that you will never be content to do absolutely nothing, Lucia suggests that you take a stroll about Falcon's Nest and speak with the various peoples who have come to attend the conference. She also makes mention that lords Artoirel and Emmanellain should be nearby, as both have graciously volunteered their services."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_SEQ_02","Though they come from different walks of life, the Ishgardians with whom you speak all share a similar hope for peace, however unimaginable it might feel. The two young lords of House Fortemps are not difficult to find, but Emmanellain seems disinclined to conversation. Perhaps his older brother will be more obliging."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_SEQ_03","As you converse with Lord Artoirel about recent affairs, Lucia abruptly appears and announces that a party of Convictors has refused to stand down, and have instead pledged to engage any Dravanians they spy flying towards Falcon's Nest. Needless to say, such an act could spell disaster for the peace conference, and the first commander intends to ride out to the Convictory and resolve the situation in person. Lord Artoirel, she feels, would only strengthen her claim, as he can speak with the authority of House Fortemps. The young lord agrees, and before he departs he asks that you look after his younger brother, who he fears may fail to carry out his duties in his absence."

59,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_ROTHE_000_051","Don't misunderstand─we've all got a healthy fear of being bathed in dragon fire. That being said, the heretics did far more to hinder our efforts here in the past, so hearin' that we're close to a reconciliation comes as a great relief!"

66,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_CITIZENA02233_000_091","When I heard that Ser Aymeric was planning to make a speech, I knew I couldn't miss it. I mean, the man risked his own neck to rescue those hostages! How often do we get heroes like that in this day and age?"

78,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_ARTOIREL_000_119","I understand completely. Let us depart at once."
79,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_ARTOIREL_000_120","But ere we do, I must ask: would you look after Emmanellain while I am away?"
80,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_ARTOIREL_000_121","As you know, he has ever been an impulsive, changeable child, but recently he seems to have been suffering from a bout of melancholy."
81,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_ARTOIREL_000_122","I thought to lift his spirits by having him assist with guard duty─a simple but honorable charge, unlikely to expose him to danger given the presence of so many other knights. Alas, he has taken no interest, and I fear he may abandon his post in my absence."
82,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_ARTOIREL_000_123","All I ask is that you keep an eye on him until I return...exhausting though that may be."
83,"TEXT_HEAVNC104_02234_ARTOIREL_000_124","Thank you, my friend. I promise we will not be long."
