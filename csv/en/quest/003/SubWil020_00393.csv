50,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_AETHELWINE_002","How would you like to conduct a bit of field research for me? I'm dying to know what color the ladies of Ul'dah are wearing these days─especially on the Hustings Strip."
51,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_AETHELWINE_003","And when you're finished, please call on Leucu at the Alchemists' Guild. The woman is a <Emphasis>wizard</Emphasis> with dyes. Have her cook up whatever color you find is most popular."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_DODOMUN_000","What color is in fashion? Well, I must say, I'm just back from Gridania, and I find there's a certain verve to verdant livery... <sigh> <Emphasis>Green</Emphasis>, you bloody idiot!"

55,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_TALK_SCENE00004_000","We Sultansworn have vowed to put the safety of the sultana and her house before all else! But I sure could go for a sandwich..."

64,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_AUBELET_000","The most popular color of late? Well, all colors have their merits, of course. But, if pressed, I'd have to say red."
65,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_TALK_SCENE00016_000","Beyond lies the upper tier of Ul'dah, home to nobles and aristocrats alike. Know that here the eyes of the Sultansworn are upon you at all times."
66,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_TETESHAN_000","Why, any color is perfectly fine for a dress, you silly thing. So long as it comes off easily at the end of the night!"
67,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_TALK_SCENE00012_000","The royals strut about as though the sun shone out of their arses, but I hear life in the palace isn't nearly so sweet as they'd have us believe. Word is most merchants lead far fatter lives than any of the sultansblood."
68,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_LEUCU_000","You are here on behalf of the Weavers' Guild, are you not? Yes, Aethelwine said you'd be along. Well, what color is it to be, then?"
69,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_LEUCU_001","It sounds as though you have two votes for red, one vote each for green, yellow, white, and black, one abstaining, and one vote for...a motley of red and green overlaid with stripes of purple and dark brown."
70,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_LEUCU_002","By no means a resounding victory, but I suppose red it shall be. I have some catalysts I've been saving for just such an occasion. Mark my words: I'm going to concoct the most vibrant red Ul'dah has ever seen!"
71,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_LEUCU_003","Alchemy may look arcane and esoteric to the uninitiated, but it is grounded in naught but science and experimentation. Indeed, I daresay it does more to advance culture and civilization than nigh any other discipline."
