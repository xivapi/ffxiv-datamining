1,"TEXT_SUBFST056_00377_SEQ_01","You have been tasked with removing blue trumpet mushrooms from the heavenspillar root found in the Matron's Lethe. Remove the fungal menace before it has a chance to spread and cause the wood to rot."

3,"TEXT_SUBFST056_00377_SEQ_03","Your simple act of mushroom picking has saved the root of the heavenspillar from a rotten fate. Though not an ideal walkway, Theodore insists that the root is essential for travel through the drastically altered geography of the Central Shroud."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST056_00377_OSHAJAAB_000_2","I know what you're thinking: it's naught more than a mushroom, so why the commotion? I'll tell you why. You allow that fungal menace to multiply, and within a moon they'll be covering the whole damn root and rotting the wood clear through."

54,"TEXT_SUBFST056_00377_THEODORE_000_13","It is not, perhaps, the easiest pathway to walk, but there are those who believe the will of the Matron Herself caused this tendril of a heavenspillar to remain thus suspended, that it might serve the forest's people. I'm rather fond of the notion, myself."
