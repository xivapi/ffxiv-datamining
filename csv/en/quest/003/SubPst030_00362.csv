Concerned upon hearing of the deputy postmoogle's plight, the tavern keeper promises to keep an ear out for any information that might serve to aid his recovery. In return, he entrusts you with a letter for Baderon of Limsa Lominsa's Drowning Wench, which was mistakenly delivered to the wrong establishment. Identifying the letter as having been delivered by his brash and overconfident brother, the young postmoogle asks you to watch over him as well. Make for the Gridania airship landing, from which the presumptuous postmoogle is scheduled to depart."

Though the deputy postmoogle's wounds will yet require time to heal, A–Ruhn–Senna has new ideas that may expedite the recovery process. In the meanwhile, the exploits of the two young moogles have apparently inspired countless young moogles to pursue a career in letter carrying. In recognition of your efforts, the deputy postmoogle names you a full-fledged member of his ranks. Though he has decided to prioritize the training of his new recruits for the time being, the day will surely come again that he requires your aid.
