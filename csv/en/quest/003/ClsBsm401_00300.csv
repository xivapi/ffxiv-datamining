1,"TEXT_CLSBSM401_00300_SEQ_01","As your reputation continues to grow, it seems even your guildmates have come to covet your wares. However, the forgemaster does not expect you to furnish your guildmates with the tools they seek; rather, he would have you craft a single wrapped crowsbeak hammer of impeccable quality to serve as a model for the other smiths. When it is ready, deliver it to Brithael for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM401_00300_SEQ_02","Though Brithael briefly jests that your hammer might serve to discourage your forgemates from pursuing their craft, it is clear that he hopes your work will instead inspire others to follow in your footsteps and become better blacksmiths. Only time will tell if your forgemates will rise to the challenge.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 45."
