1,"TEXT_SUBWIL074_00388_SEQ_01","Although Aethelgyth knows Osbert is injured, the stubborn sentry refuses to admit anything to her. Believing he might more readily accept aid from a stranger, she bids you offer him a hi-potion, which can be purchased from a merchant nearby."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL074_00388_SEQ_02","As Aethelgyth suspected, Osbert was more receptive to your offer of assistance, taking your hi-potion with only a slight show of defiance. Perhaps next time he will take more care when practicing his mummer's tricks."
