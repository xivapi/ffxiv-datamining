1,"TEXT_SUBSEA102_00399_SEQ_01","Each time a balloon envelope is ruined, it reduces the amount of cargo the Skylift operation can transport. Slay five megalocrabs and help keep the crates moving."
2,"TEXT_SUBSEA102_00399_SEQ_02","You have slain the megalocrabs. Return to the Skylift and report to W'dhovaka."
3,"TEXT_SUBSEA102_00399_SEQ_03","Thanks to your shell-cracking efforts, the balloon envelopes are safe from marauding megalocrabs for a time. With the demand for cargo transport ever growing, however, a more permanent solution to the problem seems in order."
