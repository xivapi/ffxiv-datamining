53,"TEXT_CLSEXC020_00311_BLAUTHOTA_000_4","Alright, then. All that needs doin' now is to speak with the axemaster himself. Sounds simple? I've seen folk slink out the door rather than put 'emselves in the path o' that unnervin' glare."
54,"TEXT_CLSEXC020_00311_BLAUTHOTA_000_5","That's the bloke right there in the middle o' the room. Wyrnzoen's his name. Put some steel in yer spine an' look him straight in the eye when ye talk to him, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Good fortune to ye."
55,"TEXT_CLSEXC020_00311_WYRNZOEN_000_10","Yes. I am Wyrnzoen. “Axemaster” they call me. Not the most imaginative of titles, I agree, but one should not underestimate the value of directness. I welcome your interest in our guild."
56,"TEXT_CLSEXC020_00311_WYRNZOEN_000_12","The art of the marauder is used to rend, to cleave, and to destroy. It is not our way to simply outfight our adversaries; we seek to <Emphasis>overwhelm</Emphasis> them."

68,"TEXT_CLSEXC020_00311_WYRNZOEN_000_42","But there is much training to be done before you will wield the axe to its fullest potential. Learn well your lessons, build your strength, and make of each swing an instinctive act."
