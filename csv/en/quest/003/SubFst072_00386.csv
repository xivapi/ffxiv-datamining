59,"TEXT_SUBFST072_00386_DARANMERT_000_32","Oof. What is─? Ah, my new plate mail. And what would a Wood Wailer want with metal armor, you ask? Let's just say that after a number of engagements with Garlean heavy infantry, my mind has been opened to the protection such steel encasements can provide."
