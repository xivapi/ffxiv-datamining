49,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_GRAHATIA_000_002","Given its ability to counteract lightning's influence on the body, that remedy could be of use to the people of Alexandria as well. I am certain Lumull would be more than happy to offer it to them..."
50,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_LUMULL_000_011","Ah yes, the repairs..."
51,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_LUMULL_000_012","Are you certain you want to be put to work? If you've come all the way out to visit us, you must have had more important things in mind. And you've already helped protect the city..."

57,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_LUMULL_000_018","...No, sorry, of course you're sure. Would be rude of me to doubt you."
58,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_LUMULL_000_019","It's just, it's not every day that we get visitors, let alone from a nation that up and vanished!"
59,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_KRILE_000_020","I know that it must come as something of a shock."
60,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_KRILE_000_021","But this is our first time in Treno, and we should like to get to know the city and its people. That is why we proposed lending a hand to those in need."

63,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_LUMULL_000_024","Ordinarily, everyone would've already come for a cup, but the fiends made quite a mess this time. Might be a while before some can step away from their work."

67,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_LUMULL_000_028","I'll deliver some to town hall, so you can attend to areas you haven't seen yet!"
68,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_GRAHATIA_000_031","Like Miayli, Lumull seemed taken aback by mention of Alexandria. Perhaps they had friends or loved ones who disappeared along with it."
69,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_KRILE_000_031","If we split up, we can spend more time speaking with the locals while ensuring everyone receives the remedy promptly. Could you each take a portion?"

77,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_KRILE_000_041","So the taste is challenging even when one is accustomed to it..."
78,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_GRAHATIA_000_042","Is that so? This city is remarkably self-sufficient."
79,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTA05429_000_051","You must be one of those visitors Lumull mentioned. Odd place to be visiting, though."
80,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTA05429_000_052","Oh, you came to deliver the remedy? Thank you kindly. I was hauling beast carcasses in for processing and copped a good dose of discharged energy for my troubles. It brought on the levin sickness something fierce..."
81,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTA05429_000_053","Still, we don't go hunting outside the barrier, so we don't want to waste any part of the creatures that find their way in."
82,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTA05429_000_054","Pelts that're highly charged with lightning aether are the most valuable, of course. Tan them with the right stuff, and you can turn them into protective clothing that keeps you from getting zapped."

85,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTB05429_000_062","<Emphasis>And</Emphasis> you've brought Sleepless Rhapsody! Bless you─I'm dead on my feet after that battle. We don't usually have that many beasts breaking through at once."
86,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTB05429_000_063","Practice keeps one's skills sharp, though, so in a way I'm glad for it. And I learned a thing or two from watching you."
87,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTB05429_000_064","Oh, I can hardly wait to get to work on my grimoire! I have a number of ideas for improved geometries..."
88,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTB05429_000_065","The thoughtful application of new learning is what keeps our ancestors' magic alive and flourishing!"
89,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTC05429_000_071","There's a fresh face if ever I saw one... And what's that in your hand?"
90,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTC05429_000_072","Oh, don't mind if I do! Safety inspections take priority, but the battle doesn't feel over until I've had a cup of Sleepless Rhapsody..."
91,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTC05429_000_073","I'm proud to say that I have some small part in preparing it, too. The herbs come from my very own growery."
92,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTC05429_000_074","One of the greatest discoveries of our time is that seeds carried in by invading creatures can be cultivated into remarkable plants. Plants with the potential to mitigate the lightning's effects!"
93,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTC05429_000_075","And with as many hides as we have this time─not to mention stomachs!─it's entirely possible we'll find new varieties of herbs among our harvest."
94,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_GRAHATIA_000_081","Finished with your supply of remedy as well, have you? I expect the scent will linger on our clothing for days..."
95,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTA05429_000_082","Our histories say that when large creatures broke through the barrier, our bravest fighters would launch themselves onto their backs with the trebuchet. We have you to thank for not needing to revive that tradition today!"
96,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTB05429_000_083","Now I must face my true nemesis: circles. They're so hard to draw without making them all wobbly!"
97,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_RESIDENTC05429_000_084","The flowers around the city also sprouted from seeds that creatures carried in. So truth be told, I find it difficult to begrudge them their trespass."
98,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_KRILE_000_091","Between the three of us, we ought to have covered every area aside from Lumull's."
99,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_KRILE_000_092","One of the people I spoke with asked me to pass something along to him, but he hasn't returned yet."
100,"TEXT_KINGMJ104_05429_KRILE_000_093","In the meantime, shall we discuss what we've learned?"
