1,"TEXT_KINGMJ101_05426_SEQ_01","With Calyx defeated and his schemes undone, it is time for you and your companions to consider the future. Though the matter of investigating the Ascians' interference in historical events of the Ninth remains, Y'shtola volunteers to continue working with Shale to lay bare any lingering secrets, leaving Alphinaud and Alisaie free to return to their efforts to aid the people of Garlemald. Via a sudden linkpearl call, you learn that Erenville, too, will soon be departing for lands afar, so you hasten to the Backroom to collect Shale, who surely wishes to say her own farewells."
2,"TEXT_KINGMJ101_05426_SEQ_02","You find Shale precisely where you expected: at her station in the Backroom. To your companions' surprise, she is tempted away from her work with little fuss. Apparently, the documents recovered from the containment complex still require time to decrypt, and so she is free to attend to personal matters─such as seeing off a taciturn Viera."
3,"TEXT_KINGMJ101_05426_SEQ_03","You arrive at High Tide Harbor to find Erenville resigned to his fate, though he nevertheless makes a token protest at being subject to fond farewells. Now, all that remains is to wait for Alphinaud and Alisaie to join you."
4,"TEXT_KINGMJ101_05426_SEQ_04","Those remaining in Tural offer heartfelt good-byes and promises of future reunions to those departing. As you see them off, the ship carrying Erenville, Alphinaud, and Alisaie gradually shrinks to a tiny dot on the horizon, before vanishing entirely."
5,"TEXT_KINGMJ101_05426_SEQ_05","What comes next, along with your role in it, remains unclear. By the sounds of it, however, Krile has an idea..."
