0,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_00","Lumull is resolved to meet the Doomtrain head-on─but would prefer to depart before he can think about it any longer."
1,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_01","Preparations made, you speak with Lumull, who encourages you to climb aboard the hover cargo. The sooner, the better, for the Doomtrain draws nearer with every passing moment..."
2,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_02","After a few words of warning, you are seated by the cargo operator and lift off, bound for Bentini.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the cargo operator in Overture Plaza."
3,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_03","You arrive at the depot, where Lumull shares the details of his plan. Whilst he drives the locomotive, you are to ride a flatcar at the rear of the train so as to remain in range of your screaming steel foe. Though you have triumphed over your fair share of formidable enemies, it remains to be seen if prior experience has sufficiently prepared you for the coming battle with doom incarnate.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the cargo operator in Overture Plaza."
4,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_04","Following a mere few brushes with death─and the sacrifice of several flatcars─you manage to put the brakes on the runaway Doomtrain once and for all. With luck, the rest of the ride back to Treno will afford some opportunity to catch your breath, for there is no telling what awaits within the city.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the cargo operator in Overture Plaza, or via the Alexandria crater below Living Memory."
5,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_05","Lumull slows your own train to a stop, and the two of you make immediately for the center of town. Per Eyaney's detector, several beasts stalk the streets, and these must be dealt with before you might consider the crisis resolved."
6,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_06","Alongside your companions, you defeat the last of the marauding creatures─including a hulking, hypercharged behemoth. Krile in particular makes a remarkable show of determination and ingenuity, driving herself to her very limits to protect the people of Treno.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return from the Alexandria crater below Living Memory."
7,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_07","With the Doomtrain's entourage destroyed, and the barrier restored, those inside the city can now rest easy. When you return to Main Street, you are received as heroes. Miayli, for her part, is delighted to see your group largely unharmed─though it is Krile who seems to draw her focus. Gently, she asks the younger Milalla whether she knows the name “Alayla,” prompting Krile to collapse to the flagstones in a combination of shock and exhaustion. Seeing this, Miayli promises to tell the tale of both Alayla and the key, though only after Treno's saviors have had sufficient rest. Fortunately, Y'shtola is quick to draw upon her healing magicks, that her friend might have her answers ere long."
8,"TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_08","You speak with Krile, who has found her feet again thanks to Y'shtola's ministrations. Betraying a touch of hesitation as to what comes next, she asks whether you might not wish to undergo similar treatment before Miayli shares her story..."
