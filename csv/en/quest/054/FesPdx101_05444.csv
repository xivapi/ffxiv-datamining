The loquacious Lalafell plans to write an article regarding the financial success of the Songbirds and the Seneschal Prince─star performers of Little Ladies' Day─and bids you accompany him as an impartial interviewer as he gathers information.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESPDX101_05444_SEQ_02","Dural Tharal reiterates that the key to his piece's success will be direct statements from fans of the Songbirds and Seneschal Prince. He suggests searching near the Gate of Nald for those clad in the singers' colors, as they will likely provide him with earnest feedback."
3,"TEXT_FESPDX101_05444_SEQ_03","You and Dural Tharal interview a pair of fans donning red and blue─the colors of Songbirds Ulala and Masha Mhakaracca.

5,"TEXT_FESPDX101_05444_SEQ_05","In a fateful twist, the young bystander Dural Tharal eyed on Ruby Road is none other than Aldiytha Thorne, heir to House Thorne of Little Ladies' Day fame. As she gazes upon the boisterous spectacle from afar, she expounds upon the value of enjoying one's favorite pastimes. Inspired by Aldiytha's observations, Dural Tharal expresses his thanks to the young Thorne for her time and looks to you for another word."
6,"TEXT_FESPDX101_05444_SEQ_06","Duly satisfied with what he learned from interviewing Aldiytha and fans of the Little Ladies' Day performers, Dural Tharal encourages you to participate in one final task: the concert itself."

Dural Tharal would prefer to take a more objective observation of the festivities, however, choosing to watch from afar while you mingle with the fans. When you are ready, the seneschal bids you speak with the royal handmaiden to acquire the garments and illuminations you will require to make the most of the entertainment to come.
