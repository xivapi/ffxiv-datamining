1,"TEXT_KINGRA304_05438_SEQ_01","With preparations for the heavyweight title match underway, Yaana proposes returning to her gym, where you can rest up before the big event. Yet no sooner do you exit the Arcadion than you are accosted by the heavyweights Vamp Fatale, Deep Blue, and Red Hot. Their ambush is cut short, however, by the sudden arrival of the Tyrant. Making short work of them, he then demands you learn of the Arcadion's history, if you are so determined to alter its future. It is clear through his explanation that he believes the usage of feral souls is crucial to the institution's identity. While there are fans who agree, there are also those who would welcome change. The Tyrant departs as suddenly as he appeared, and with your path clear at last, Yaana would hurry back to learn how the rescue mission fared."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA304_05438_SEQ_02","Entering the gym, you see that the others are yet to return, leaving Yaana visibly anxious. Just as you are trying to take her mind off of the mission, Retsarra at last appears─and behind him, a slightly disheveled, but otherwise hale Neyuni. Once all are present, she explains that the kidnappers removed Eutrope's regulator, and took her somewhere else. The very same modus operandi the president used to cover up the true fate of the immortalized. Yaana loses hope for a moment, until Dancing Green offers some much needed words of encouragement. Leaving Eutrope's rescue in Metem's hands, it is your mission to secure the cure by usurping the Tyrant's throne. With Neyuni's discovery that he intends to use the soul of a behemoth in battle, you can face him with full knowledge of what he may bring to bear. And it seems even Pomb, Hector's adorable kitten, wishes to cheer you on─how could you possibly lose?"
3,"TEXT_KINGRA304_05438_SEQ_03","Given the publicity for the title match, Yaana expects there to be fans along the way to the Arcadion, and proposes you speak with them before the grand event. Perhaps their words may even serve to buoy your spirits...

※You must be accompanied by Yaana and Pomb to complete this task. Speak with either of them again in front of Tritails Training should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA304_05438_SEQ_04","Speaking with fans along True Vue, you are reminded of how your actions can inspire others─and you in turn feel a surge of inspiration and encouragement from their words. The time of the title match draws near, and so you venture forth to the Arcadion alongside your second and the most adorable of cheerers.

※You must be accompanied by Yaana and Pomb to complete this task. Speak with either of them again in front of Tritails Training should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_KINGRA304_05438_SEQ_05","The Arcadion attendant cordially welcomes you as always, albeit sparing some slight interest regarding Pomb's presence. Yaana informs the man that Pomb is there to cheer you on, sating his curiosity and prompting him to guide you to the greenroom."
