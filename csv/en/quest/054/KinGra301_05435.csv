1,"TEXT_KINGRA301_05435_SEQ_01","As you stroll the streets of Solution Nine during your hiatus from the Arcadion, you find yourself before the familiar doors of Tritails Training. There you speak with Yaana, who informs you that heavyweight matches are soon to begin. Prior to that, however, she has a matter she wishes to discuss with you, and bids you follow her inside."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA301_05435_SEQ_02","Yaana explains that to gather information on the president, she invited fellow former fighters to convene at the gym. Unfortunately, no one is able to share new information─that is, until Dancing Green speaks. He reveals that the president originally hailed from the nation of Lindblum, where the regeneration factor stimulant was developed. With increased confidence that there is truth behind the president's promise of the cure, the group decides to enact an operation on two fronts: firstly, for you to continue your climb to become grand champion. And secondly, to rescue Neyuni and Eutrope in secret. In so doing, you will have fulfilled your bargain with the megalomaniac, and removed his leverage against you."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA301_05435_SEQ_03","With some time remaining before matches begin, Yaana suggests you watch the Arcadion Hour broadcast for any potentially useful information. To your dismay, however, the program seems specifically designed to undermine your reputation and lower your spirits─the voice spearheading this derision towards you being none other than the heavyweight fighter Vamp Fatale. Still reeling from the viewing, you are surprised when the doors of Tritails Training suddenly open to reveal a motley group of young Alexandrians. Concerned by the broadcast's disparaging footage, they eagerly offer you words of encouragement, urging you to do your best in the heavyweight division. Soon after their departure, Yaana receives a call from Metem that matches are ready to begin. Now reinvigorated by the kind words of your fans, you set off for the Arcadion's greenroom with head held high.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA301_05435_SEQ_04","Metem is understanding of Yaana's indignation, but carefully explains that all blame for the broadcast lies at the president's feet. According to him, the Arcadion's head is beginning to feel the walls close in around him, and so he is now attempting to oust you from the competition by any means necessary. With that being the case, Metem encourages you to channel any anger you may feel into the ring, and use it to overcome the challenges ahead. Judging by Yaana's fiery expression, she seems nigh ready to jump into the ring herself."
