1,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_SEQ_01","Informing you that arrangements for your second match are not yet complete, Yaana suggests that you both return to her gym for the meantime. With some luck, Retsarra may already be waiting with an update regarding the rescue mission."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_SEQ_02","Upon your arrival, you find the boy determined to join the gym from earlier, warning you tearfully that the place has been completely wrecked. Hurrying inside, you quickly find the culprits─a tag team duo known as the Xtremes. Metem soon enters with cameras, and announces that they shall be your next opponents. It is only after all parties have left that Retsarra at last appears. He informs you that he has made progress with the rescue mission, and has discovered a clue regarding Neyuni and Eutrope's whereabouts. During your next match, he and the others intend to make a rescue attempt. With a mind to put on a good show and keep the spotlight on you as your comrades work in the shadows, you make your way back to the greenroom."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_SEQ_03","Yaana introduces the Xtremes, professional athletes who ride the waves of Solution Nine's artificial wave pool. The dynamic duo utilize the souls of storm divers, granting them the ability to manipulate water and fire respectively. To claim victory, you will need to adapt to the sudden and violent change of the elements─and the devastating coordinated maneuvers of a gnarly tag team.

4,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_SEQ_04","You master the waves of flame and water both, sending the surfing duo sinking. Despite coming at you together, the Xtremes were out of their depth against you. Yaana will no doubt wish to celebrate this victory with you─and for more reasons than one.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
5,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_SEQ_05","Yaana welcomes you back with a look of smug self-satisfaction, savoring the humbling you dished out to the Xtremes. With one more victory under your belt, only the grand champion remains."

83,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_000_121","I actually arrived earlier and witnessed them in the act. I was furious and wanted to stop them, but I feared it would draw the president's attention. Forgive me..."

88,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_000_125","According to Green, it's a plushy reception hall used to entertain important guests. In all likelihood, that's where the girls are being held."
89,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_000_126","While security is tight, we have a plan to create an opening and mount a rescue. Sugar will use her magicks to cause a commotion, which I'll exploit to sneak inside."
90,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_127","That's quite a daring strategy... But I have faith that you can pull it off!"
91,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_128","We will carry out the mission during your next match. If you do what you do best and put on a good show, the attention you'd draw to the ring would only aid our cause."
92,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_000_129","So...you'll be pitted against the Xtremes next."
93,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_100_129","It reminds me of my own time fighting as a tag team with Hector, when we were still no-name newcomers."
94,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_130","What!? Why've I never heard about this?"
95,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_000_131","Our signature move was the “Ultimate Megaboom Kick.” Hector would encase me in flames and send me flying at our opponents. Not only did it look impressive, it had some kick to it as well─pardon the pun."
96,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_000_132","Alas, we hardly drew any spectators, so management disbanded our team. We were still trying to find our place back then..."
97,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_THEHOWLINGBLADE_000_133","But getting back to the present─like all tag teams, the Xtremes will unleash powerful coordinated attacks. Take care when you face them."
98,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_134","Well, I suppose we'd better head to the greenroom. The mess can wait for now..."
99,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_200","Right, let's take a closer look at your opponents."
100,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_201","Red Hot and Deep Blue, who form the popular tag team, the Xtremes."
101,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_202","They're originally professional surfers who rose to fame with their feats at Solution Nine's artificial wave pool."
102,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_203","The brothers harness the souls of storm divers─great lizards capable of manipulating the elements─to perform dangerous techniques. As you can probably guess, Deep Blue commands water, while Red Hot wields flames."
103,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_204","I say “brothers,” but they're obviously not related by blood. It's just a part of their gimmick. Having said that, they do make a fearsome team. To echo Retsarra, you'll need to be ready for their coordinated attacks."
104,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_205","Once you've dealt with them, you'll be just one bout away from becoming grand champion. So get out there, and give those gym-wreckers what for! We'll see who's the one who wipes out!"
105,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_210","The brothers love to perform outrageous stunts, and one time they used up so many souls to revive themselves, they were roundly criticized for squandering resources. Which is to reiterate the need to be careful. Their recklessness makes them all the more dangerous."
106,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_220","You did it again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Even together, the brothers were no match for you!"
107,"TEXT_KINGRA303_05437_YAANA_000_221","Hehe, seeing you humble those smug thugs really made my day. Serves them right for making a mess of my gym!"
