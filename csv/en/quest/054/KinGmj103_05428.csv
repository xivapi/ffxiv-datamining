1,"TEXT_KINGMJ103_05428_SEQ_01","A cursory look around the levin-blasted landscape confirms that if civilization has survived on the Ninth, it is not to be found near the crater that once was Alexandria. Sphene suggests nearby Treno, a port city–state and hub of trade on the continent, as a likely location of survivors. However, due to the violent lightning storm that spans as far as the eye can see, the airship cannot make the journey. Though Clerk PX-0093 remains on standby should you need to fly back to Living Memory, henceforth, you must walk.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may returnby speaking with Clerk PX-0061 at leynode mnemo."
2,"TEXT_KINGMJ103_05428_SEQ_02","Sphene leads you to a nearby cave system that should provide passage through the mountains to Treno. From what you can see from the entrance, it does not appear to have suffered structural damage in the intervening time, so you and your companions prepare to sally forth into the darkness.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
3,"TEXT_KINGMJ103_05428_SEQ_03","Though the path was winding and arduous, you have found your way through the gates of Treno, and put down many a threat to the local populace besides. The glow of the city's lamps welcomes you to what apparently remains a thriving bastion of civilization.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return from the Alexandria crater below Living Memory."
4,"TEXT_KINGMJ103_05428_SEQ_04","In the heart of Treno, you are greeted with cheerful thanks echoing through the local speaker system, followed by an equally cheerful greeting from the mayor, Miayli. The elder Milalla is concerned by the fate of Alexandria, and so Sphene and Y'shtola volunteer to tell her of all that has come to pass while the rest of your party explores the city. Miayli suggests you begin by speaking to her grandson, Lumull, who can put you to work aiding the townsfolk."
5,"TEXT_KINGMJ103_05428_SEQ_05","You find Lumull passing out some manner of herbal remedy called “Sleepless Rhapsody,” which he insists that you try. He is also strangely keen to see your face when you do..."
6,"TEXT_KINGMJ103_05428_SEQ_06","After marshaling your courage and quaffing the face-puckering drink, you share a polite version of your impressions, as Krile and G'raha recall their past experiences facing similar trials. In short order, however, you learn that the remedy's benefits are worth tolerating the taste. Not only do you feel surprisingly refreshed, but Lumull also explains that Sleepless Rhapsody mitigates the deleterious effects of exposure to lightning aether, further noting that the recipe has been passed down by the Milalla for generations."
7,"TEXT_KINGMJ103_05428_SEQ_07","Now that he has had the opportunity to enjoy your reaction to Sleepless Rhapsody, Lumull finally remembers to introduce himself. Perhaps one day he will get around to giving you your work orders..."
