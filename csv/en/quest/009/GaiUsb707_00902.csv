1,"TEXT_GAIUSB707_00902_SEQ_01","Wincing at the howl of the wind, Ser Arthurioux instructs you to ensure that none of the braziers around the camp have gone out. Use smoldering coals to light any unlit brazier."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB707_00902_SEQ_02","All the dark braziers are now aglow, and grateful men will soon warm their frozen hands and read their letters from home. Report to Ser Arthurioux."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB707_00902_SEQ_03","Ser Arthurioux is pleased to hear that, for the first windy night in some time, every brazier at Camp Dragonhead is lit. He may find his duty a dull one, but you have a sneaking suspicion that he is well content to drowse by the fire."
