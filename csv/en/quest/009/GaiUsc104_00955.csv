1,"TEXT_GAIUSC104_00955_SEQ_01","Professor Lamberteint is delighted to encounter one of the few people with an interest in corrupted crystals, although he doubts your ability to handle such dangerous materials. As luck would have it, he is in possession of a specially warded containment device for such an occasion, which he is prepared to lend to you, in spite of your apparent shortcomings. Duly armed, proceed to Highbridge and introduce yourself to Hahasako, one of Professor Lamberteint's dedicated pupils."
