1,"TEXT_GAIUSC201_00960_SEQ_01","Ceana is certain that the area surrounding Pharos Sirius on the Isles of Umbra is replete with corrupted crystals. However, she has yet to test this hypothesis, as all access to the isles is prohibited at present. As she lacks your charming wit and way with words, she bids you question the Yellowjackets of Aleport in her stead, and attempt to discover the reason behind the travel restrictions."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC201_00960_SEQ_02","The three Yellowjackets you elect to question speak of spirits and undead infesting the Isles of Umbra. Relay this disturbing news to Ceana."

It's rather puzzling, since I always take the time to explain my motivations in great detail to the subjects of my questioning."

Ever since we were forced to abandon Pharos Sirius, the isles have become naught more than a graveyard for ships unable to navigate the shores─and a purgatory for the souls dragged down to the depths with 'em."
