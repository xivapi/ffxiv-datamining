1,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_SEQ_01","While you were questioning the Yellowjackets, Ceana was enjoying a pint at the local pub, where she heard tell of a man named Skyfryn, recently returned from the Isles of Umbra, who was detained for unknown reasons. She asks that you speak with Skyfryn in an effort to learn how he obtained permission to travel to the isles."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_SEQ_02","Skyfryn does not respond to your questions and instead rambles incoherently about a woman he desires desperately to see again. In a rare moment of lucidity, he gives you a golden feather and bids you give it to a man named Mimidoa, along with his apologies. Return to Ceana and see what she makes of Skyfryn's words."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_SEQ_03","Ceana knows Mimidoa, and states that he grabbed her arse at the pub the other day. Refusing to have any further interaction with the man, it falls to you to discover his connection to Skyfryn."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_SEQ_04","Mimidoa was dispatched to Aleport so that he might oversee the work being performed at Pharos Sirius. However, the craftsmen have all abandoned their work or simply vanished, presumably due to the rumors of an undead infestation. Upon learning that you wish to visit the Isles of Umbra for your own purposes, Mimidoa offers you a writ of passage, on the condition that you look into the rumors on his behalf. Share this good news with Ceana."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_SEQ_05","Though skeptical of Mimidoa's claims at first, Ceana recognizes that the writ of passage is genuine. She wishes you well on your journey to the Isles of Umbra, as she has no intention of accompanying you herself."

As for why all travel to the Isles of Umbra is restricted, well...mayhap it's considered too dangerous, owing to the abandonment of Pharos Sirius?"
49,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_CEANA_000_001","Yes, well, anyway─while you were questioning those Yellowjackets, I paid a visit to the local pub, since even an esteemed scholar like myself enjoys dulling her wits on occasion."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_CEANA_000_002","It was there that I heard tell of a man named Skyfryn, who was recently detained after returning from─wait for it─the <Emphasis>Isles of Umbra</Emphasis>!"
51,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_CEANA_000_003","This is the first I've heard of someone actually traveling to and from there, so I'm curious as to how he obtained permission. Mind having a chat with him in my stead? He was arrested, after all, so I'm somewhat reticent to approach him myself..."

56,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_CEANA_000_017","What did Skyfryn have to say? Hm, that's not terribly helpful. I couldn't care less how much he misses his favorite bar wench. But what was that about a man named Mimidoa?"
57,"TEXT_GAIUSC202_00961_CEANA_000_018","Wait...I <Emphasis>know</Emphasis> that name! That's that bastard who grabbed my arse the other day at the pub! Well, if you want to give him that feather, be my guest─I'm not going anywhere near him and his wandering hands."
