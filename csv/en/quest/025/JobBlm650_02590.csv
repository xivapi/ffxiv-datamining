1,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SEQ_01","While she waits for Shatotto to wake from her slumber, Lalai would gather further information regarding the falling star. A missive from 269th Order Mendicant Da Za in Revenant's Toll speaks of further golem sightings. Seek out your kobold friend, that you might gain whatever knowledge necessary to stave off attacks that might endanger your beastman friends."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SEQ_02","A brief conversation with Da Za reveals that the particular golems rampaging in the area appear to be of Mhachi construction. Shatotto, who has once again assumed control of Lalai's consciousness, expresses her disbelief that constructs she herself played a part in creating could be behaving in such a manner, leading the ever-wary Zhai'a Nelhah to doubt her motivations. You set out for the Tangle, where the golems were last sighted, in hopes of finding further answers."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SEQ_03","No sooner have you arrived in the Tangle than Shatotto senses a strong aetheric presence and promptly dashes off in pursuit. Zhai'a Nelhah follows her, meaning to keep an eye on the sorceress and golems both, while bidding you to survey the far side of the bog, to ensure that no menaces of living stone lie in wait."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SEQ_04","Your foray to the southeastern reaches of the swamp proves uneventful. Return to the southwest, that you might see how your companions fared in their own scouting effort."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SEQ_05","You arrive on the scene just in time to rescue the embattled Shatotto and Zhai'a Nelhah from the mindless wrath of a golem gone berserk. Shatotto, in particular, seems uncharacteristically shaken up by the ordeal. Tend to the sorceress and see that neither she nor her host Lalai has suffered grave injury."
6,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SEQ_06","Shatotto and Zhai'a Nelhah have at long last come to something of a mutual understanding, and all it took was staring certain death in the eye together on the field of battle. The conversation turns to the subject of Lalai, and Shatotto chastises the stodgy Hearer for his pathetically hopeless understanding of the fairer sex, causing him to flee from the scene a blithering mess. Shatotto also takes her leave, sensing that she is about to fall back into slumber, and bids you return to Ul'dah to consult with Lalai when she wakes."
7,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SEQ_07","Lalai welcomes you back to Ul'dah and explains that Shatotto has once again returned to rest, though not before sharing her plans for the next stage of your mission: to wit, she would venture further afield to fend off any potential golem rampages at the pass. Lalai encourages you to continue your studies with due diligence. Though you know not when the call will come, come it will, and Shatotto will be ill pleased if you are not up to the task.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 68."

50,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_LALAI_000_002","Doubtless she will return when she sees fit, but in the meanwhile we can ill afford to bide our time. And so, I have taken Zhai'a Nelhah's advice─I can just see the smug grin on his face as I say that─and reached out to our friends."
51,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_LALAI_000_003","Not moments ago, a postmoogle came by with a missive from our friend Da Za of the 269th Order. As luck would have it, it seems he has knowledge that might serve us well─to wit, reports of recent sightings of rampaging golems."

56,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_ZHAIANELHAH_000_012","You do me discredit, Lalai.

And that is not all! It was no ordinary golem─no, no─but rather the same one I saw in a tome handed down from my forebear Da Gu! A golem of ancient Mhach!"
62,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SHATOTTO_000_018","One of my own creations? Why, that is simply inconceivable! I designed them to be utterly rampage-proof, and left copious instructions to ensure that my loyal apprentices─and <Emphasis>their</Emphasis> apprentices, and so on and so forth─would see they stay that way."
63,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_ZHAIANELHAH_000_019","Mayhap your followers were not so diligent in carrying out your orders after your passing? We all know of the chaos and destruction wreaked by Mhachi sorcerers during the War of the Magi. I suspect that poring over age-old documents on the upkeep of golems was the least of their concerns."

75,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SHATOTTO_000_040","Yes, I have observed this as well... Smaller minds are quick to burden themselves with hand-wringing concern for the well-being of others. As if it were not evident that the girl is more than capable of taking care of herself!"

77,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_SHATOTTO_000_046","Anyhow, I do believe we have some golems to smite into oblivion. The Tangle, was it? I'll see you there─and do try not to get lost on the way."
78,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_ZHAIANELHAH_000_050","This Shatotto is full of mysteries, but one baffles me the most─just what is it about Lalai's cap that she finds so disagreeable? Was there no custom of wearing headgear in her age?"

81,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_ZHAIANELHAH_000_062","I will accompany Shatotto to ensure that she remains focused on the task at hand. Might you survey the area south of here? These environs afford our foe no end of hiding spots, and I am ill inclined to walk into an ambush."
82,"TEXT_JOBBLM650_02590_ZHAIANELHAH_000_065","While I appreciate the support, friend, I assure you I am quite capable of taking care of myself. Might you investigate to the east of here, as we agreed upon?"
