67,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_048","Yes, yes. A common tale, and one believed by many tribes."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_049","But what it does not mention is this: Azim and Nhaama were lovers."
69,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_050","Oh, they fought in the beginning, as did their creations. That much is true. But when they saw how the Xaela and the Raen rose above their hatreds and joined hands in harmony, their hearts stirred, and the love their children shared became theirs as well."
70,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_051","Alas, he was of the sun and she of the moon. Apart they must remain, lest day and night cease to be, and with them all creation."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_052","With sadness in their hearts they returned to the heavens─he to the day, she to the night, destined to walk before and after, never to meet."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_053","As time passed, Azim's yearning for his beloved grew deeper still. Was there truly naught that could be done, he wondered. At last, he knew."

74,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_055","So it was that Azim took a fragment of his being and with it fashioned an avatar. Clad in scale of midnight, he descended, and sought out the Xaela."
75,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_056","Yea, he was the first Oronir. We are of his flesh and his blood. We are the children of Azim, and it is our duty to watch over and keep the Xaela safe."
76,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_HIEN_000_057","...I confess, I did not expect the tale of your people's beginnings to be quite so romantic."
77,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_HIEN_000_058","Yet I must ask: if it is your duty to defend the Xaela, how can you go to war with them in the Naadam? Is that not a contradiction?"
78,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_059","If a father disciplines his son, does that mean there is no love in his heart? Xaela are not wont to kneel. They must be made to─only then will they heed reason."

84,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_065","So you see, for every son of Azim is a daughter of Nhaama for whom he must search. Even now."
85,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_UDUTAI_000_070","Come again, traveler. There are tales to be told, songs to be sung."
86,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_HIEN_000_080","Mayhap I am being overly optimistic, but I sense that these Oronir may prove loyal allies to Doma under the right circumstances."
87,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_HIEN_000_081","Their arrogance is rooted in the belief that they must act as caretakers of all Xaela. Therefore, if we can prove to them that we come as kindred spirits, seeking to defeat a common foe..."
88,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_HIEN_000_082","But mayhap this is a discussion for <Emphasis>after</Emphasis> we win the Naadam. Come, let us return to Magnai."
89,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_LYSE_000_090","You're back. They had me milking sheep, by the way. It was, um, interesting..."
90,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_HIEN_000_095","Another “task” completed, eh? I wonder what the most radiant brother has in store for us next."
91,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_GOSETSU_000_100","At a glance, their arms and armor may seem crude compared to those of Doma, but they are well crafted, and no less effective."
92,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_MAGNAI_000_110","Hmm...you shine with the light of newfound wisdom. Could it be that you have at last accepted the supremacy of the Sun?"
93,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_MAGNAI_000_111","No matter. You have each completed your tasks, and proven yourselves deserving of mercy."
94,"TEXT_STMBDA411_02510_MAGNAI_000_112","However, if it is freedom you desire, then there is one more thing you must do..."
