50,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_CONRAD_000_010","Enjoy your time with M'naago and her kin? Aye, that's what I want to hear. Too many soldiers forget the importance of time away from all this."
51,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_SERPENTOFFICER_000_015","On behalf of the Elder Seedseer, I thank you for your swift and decisive action against the primal menace. We are not unaware of the danger it posed to our fair nation."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_STORMOFFICER_000_020","The imperials underestimated us once, and they paid dearly for it. They may not be so easily deceived next time─but if we cannot fool them, we will simply have to break them!"
53,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALISAIE_000_025","So that's why the village was unharmed..."
54,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_LYSE_000_030","I don't know why the imperials would abandon Ala Ghiri without a fight, but I'm glad they did."
55,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALPHINAUD_000_035","Rather cowardly of them. Uncharacteristically so..."
56,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_MNAAGO_000_040","Well, you heard the Flame General. Looks like we've got a meeting to attend!"
57,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_050","That everyone? Then let us begin."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_051","Ala Ghiri is ours, and for a mercy we took it without losing a single man. But we dare not grow complacent─Specula Imperatoris will not be so easily won."
59,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALPHINAUD_000_052","If I may, General─should we not pause to consider the imperials' motivations? For Zenos to surrender a fortified settlement of strategic importance without so much as firing a shot is...inexplicable."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_053","We searched the village and found no traps or other signs of sabotage. Suspicious though it may be, I will not refuse this gift from our enemy."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_054","The path to Ala Mhigo is through the east─through Specula Imperatoris, and Castrum Abania. It bears repeating, however, that the latter is home to a massive cannon with unparalleled range and destructive power."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_PIPIN_000_055","Which means that we will need to strike Specula Imperatoris quickly, both to limit their ability to locate our forces in the field, and to utilize the installation as a shield against attack, as they would doubtless not risk damaging the towers."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALPHINAUD_000_056","I see... Then we have no choice but to accept what we have been given."
64,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_CONRAD_000_057","Aye, that's the way of it. I've no doubt that Zenos has got something planned, but we'll just have to deal with it when the time comes."
65,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_058","To the assault, then. The main host will commence a direct assault on Specula Imperatoris. During this time, I would hold the Scions in reserve at Ala Ghiri to deal with any imperial forces that may be dispatched in response."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALPHINAUD_000_059","Understood."
67,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_LYSE_000_060","Wait a minute! We should be fighting with you and the Resistance!"

72,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_LYSE_000_063","Thanks. I knew you would understand."
73,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_LYSE_000_064","I won't. I promise I'll do what Conrad says."
74,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALPHINAUD_000_065","...Mayhap it would be best if I accompanied you. Alisaie can stay with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
75,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALISAIE_000_066","Oh, go if you must. The two of us can take care of ourselves."
76,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_067","You have your orders. Dismissed!"
77,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALISAIE_000_070","So full of fire and eager, weren't they? Well, I wouldn't worry too much. They're strong and they have each other."
