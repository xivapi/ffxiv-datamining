51,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_GOSETSU_000_020","Such contempt as was in their eyes I have never known... But for the soul to live on as they say is not something I can so easily accept."

56,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_KOKO_000_041","I marked you after I left the Oronir. Ones from Doma, others I could not place."

58,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_KOKO_000_043","Hm? Koko sounds to your ear the name of a woman? Well, of course. That would be because it is."
59,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_KOKO_000_044","I died a woman and was reborn a man. It is of no moment─the soul is the soul, and the flesh the flesh."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_KOKO_000_045","Perhaps you scoff? Many would. Many look only to the name and the flesh, and let these things dictate their perceptions."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_KOKO_000_046","Consider Sadu Khatun. Three times before she died a man, yet she returns as a woman the fourth. Yet she is no less fierce, and any outsider foolish enough to think so will learn the truth to their peril."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_KOKO_000_047","Is the khatun woman or man? A stupid question. She is Sadu."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_QOYAR_000_050","The cycle of death and rebirth? It is simply that. Take me─I died in battle with the Hotgo. Fiercely did I fight, and so I returned."

67,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_MERGEN_000_061","We were childhood friends, he and I, before he fell and returned. A master of the bow. It is good to see that he retains his skill."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_MERGEN_000_062","We competed against one another in the hunts. Though I knew he would return, I never expected it to be as my son!"

70,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_GOSETSU_000_071","Aye, it is as she said. They believe with every fiber of their being that their bravest warriors will be reborn."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_GOSETSU_000_072","As for me, I observed some of their warriors at practice. They are as formidable as the Oronir, perhaps more, and their weapons are their equal as well."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA413_02512_GOSETSU_000_073","Yet while they do not lack in skill and resources, 'tis plain to see that their numbers are inferior..."
