1,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SEQ_01","Lalai eagerly shares with you a new and most fascinating discovery. In poring over the reunited Books of Nald'thal, she has unearthed what appears to be a long-lost incantation. Entirely unfamiliar to her, the spell is accompanied by only a concise instruction urging the would-be caster to speak the words at Nald's Reflection. Convinced that Master Ququruka meant to bequeath some profound knowledge to his pupil, Lalai dashes off, making it all too clear that she expects you to follow close behind."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SEQ_02","At Lalai's behest, you invoke the spell according to the instructions writ in the tome. No sooner have the words left your mouth than a wisp of light emerges from the chalice of the statue of Nald. It then floats across the room, stopping before you in an ominous warning before striking the body of your companion in full force. Not moments later, Lalai is no longer herself, but speaking to you in the voice of none other than Shatotto─the storied mother of black magic herself. No sooner has the mighty sorceress introduced herself to you than she brandishes her staff in your general direction, eager to test whether you are worthy of aiding her in performing some cryptic-yet-vital task. Summoning forth all the strength you can muster, you hold the sorceress and her array of destructive incantations at bay, a development which seems to please her greatly."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SEQ_03","Relieved to see that you indeed possess the strength she seeks, Shatotto at last deigns to share with you the true reason for her return. She has scarce begun to describe the impending danger, however, when her strength begins to fade. Moments later, she is gone, and Lalai once again regains control of her own consciousness. At a loss for how to proceed, she proposes that you return to the Sacrarium to further discuss the matter at hand."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SEQ_04","Though Shatotto's sudden appearance has raised more questions than answers, one thing is clear: there are dark clouds on the horizon. As Lalai returns to the study of the tomes in hopes of gleaning further answers, you return to your study of the black arts, that you might be better equipped to face the challenges to come.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 63."

49,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_001","Thanks in no small part to your efforts, the books of Nald'thal have at long last been reunited in these halls, their long-lost secrets just waiting to be unearthed."
50,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_002","Though I have scarcely begun poring over the tomes, I have already made a most remarkable discovery. Each of the twin tomes contained a cipher of sorts, the meaning of which could only be deciphered when the two are referenced in tandem. I will spare you the details of how I unraveled the message─though it truly was among my finer moments, if I daresay so myself."
51,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_003","At any rate, the words─once decoded─are most evidently an incantation, albeit one entirely unfamiliar to me. Beneath it was writ a simple directive:
“Heir to the dark arts, speak these words unto Nald's Reflection, that memories long forgotten may stir anew.”"
52,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_004","As to what precisely these words are referencing, your guess is as good as mine. Still, Master Ququruka doubtless preserved the incantation and the accompanying message in his records for a reason. And if we are not the heirs to the art of black magic, then who is?"
53,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_050","So I trust I can expect to see you at Nald's Reflection. And do try to hurry, yes? I would prefer not to delay any potentially epoch-making discoveries any longer than necessary."
54,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_100","...And that is all you need know. When I give the sign, you are to chant the words precisely as I instructed. Understood?"
55,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_101","Now, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
56,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_102","That light...!"
57,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_103","(-???-)...You. Yes, you shall serve as the bringer of destruction. As for my vessel...ah, yes. <Emphasis>That</Emphasis> one should suffice."
58,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_104","...Hm? Whatever was that strange sensation? For a moment, it was as if a great fire burned within me, and then..."
59,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_105","Nghhh... Now, it is as if my very mind is being rent in two. And this voice...!"
60,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_106","(-Lalai?-)...Well, well. It feels good to walk the earth for the first time in two millennia. Seems that old coot proved himself useful after all. If he hadn't kicked it, I'd find him and give him a pat on the back."
61,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_107","(-Lalai?-)And what are <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> gawking at? You are a black mage, are you not? Surely you possess the common sense to recognize the woman who stands before you. Or will you be needing a hint?"
62,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_108","(-Shatotto-)Some would call me Death's Handmaiden, but I always found that particular epithet so needlessly morbid. Though technically speaking I am but manifestation of a memory, you may call me by the name I used in life─Shatotto, at your service! But I jest, of course─it's <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> who are at <Emphasis>mine</Emphasis>."
63,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_109","(-Shatotto-)I must say, what is it with black mages today and these unwieldy hats? Do they truly believe it makes them look more imposing? Or are they merely compensating for something? In either event, <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> have no need of such adornments."
64,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_110","Now that's more like it! <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, was it? Of course it was. Now that we're on a first-name basis, you'll have to tell me all about yourself. On second thought...let's skip that. Time is short, and to be quite honest, I don't particularly care."
65,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_111","At any rate, as I might have mentioned, I am not the <Emphasis>true</Emphasis> Shatotto as she once lived, but rather a manifestation of her memory—er, <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> memory. Needless to say, that still makes me the most powerful sorceress currently existing in your world. You'd do well to remember that if you ever have a mind to cross me."
66,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_112","Well, then! Now that we've gotten the pleasantries out of the way, what do you say we have a little fun? Prepare to be blasted into a kazillion itty-bitty pieces!"
67,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_113","Oh, come now, must I spell everything out for you? I must know if you are sufficiently adept at the dark arts to help me forestall impending doom, and this is by far the easiest way to do so. Not to mention the most fun─prepare for a world of pain!"
68,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_140","...Not half bad. That painfully dull expression on your face had me worried, but I suppose you'll do after all."
69,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_141","“Do” for what? Try to keep up, will you? I abhor repeating myself. Let me start at the beginning. Two thousand, three hundred years ago, the greatest mage our realm has ever known─that would be me─compiled a choice assortment of the most potent offensive incantations and evocations into the school known as black magic."
70,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_142","You still seem puzzled. I also devised a spell that would allow my memory to one day return. My reasons were twofold─for one, I simply had to see for myself how the art of destruction would be handed down eras after I had inevitably passed. For another, I knew that without my guidance, this realm would one day meet most certain─"
71,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_143","...Oh, this won't do. I had thought the girl stronger than this, but... These eyelids grow heavy, and my consciousness wanes... I suppose I'll just have to take a little nap."
72,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_144","But remember this, my puppet of destruction. You have an important role to play in the battle to come─a battle that will decide the fate of your very world. Till next I wake...shirk not...your study of the art..."
73,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_145","(-Lalai-)<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>...? Where are we? It is as if I just woke from the strangest dream..."
74,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_SHATOTTO_000_146","(-Lalai-)And yet, my every limb aches, as if my respite were more exhausting than the fiercest of battles. Did you perchance observe anything odd happen to me?"
75,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_147","Preposterous...or so most would say. But you have no reason to tell me falsehoods, and it would certainly explain the curious symptoms I find myself experiencing."
76,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_148","Shatotto, the mother of our dark art─she who pursued the power of destruction to and beyond any limits that could be conceived. Has her consciousness truly taken up residence in my own mind?"

78,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_150","...It is no use. I call out, but she does not answer. Whether she slumbers or simply deigns not to answer, I cannot say."
79,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_151","I fear I am at something of a loss. Let us return to the Sacrarium and clear our heads. Mayhap the answers we seek will yet reveal themselves to us."
80,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_160","...I'm afraid it's no use. I have called out to Shatotto within my mind time and time again, but I am met only with silence."
81,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_161","If only Master were still here, surely he could shed some light on the matter. After all, it was he that recorded for posterity the words we used to summon forth Shatotto's memory."
82,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_162","Wait...that's it. Master himself may not be here, but his writings may yet contain the answer to our queries. It was within the statue of Nald that the memory slumbered─this does not strike me as mere coincidence."
83,"TEXT_JOBBLM601_02588_LALAI_000_163","I believe that settles it. I will return to the tomes and see what knowledge can be gleaned, that we might prepare ourselves for whatever task awaits us."
