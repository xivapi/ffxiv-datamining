1,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_01","With Momozigo's connections, Musosai has identified an evil in Ul'dah that wants for excising: an unscrupulous moneylender who preys upon the poor. The crook in question has been doing his rounds at Stonesthrow, charging exorbitant rates on the meagerest sums and forcing into slavery those who are unable to repay their loans. To begin with, Musosai suggests heading to Stonesthrow and asking the denizens about the moneylender."
2,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_02","True to Momozigo's information, many residents of Stonesthrow have found themselves at the moneylender's mercy. Among them is a maiden who is about to be sold off to repay the debt she incurred to buy medicine for her sick father. You have learned all you need to know; time to rejoin Musosai."
3,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_03","Your report of the people's suffering infuriates Musosai, and he sets off to find the downtrodden daughter of which you spoke."
4,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_04","As the downtrodden daughter tells you of her plight, who should happen to arrive but the vile moneylender himself, a man named Phelyp. Though at first you move to prevent him from taking the maiden away, Musosai bids you put up your steel. There is more to this than Phelyp alone, he posits, and by giving the moneylender a line, he will lead you to his accomplices. With that, you set off in pursuit, in the direction of the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard."
5,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_05","You catch Phelyp meeting with a corrupt Brass Blades commander, whose blind eye he has been buying with bribes. Satisfied that the time to draw steel is come, Musosai bids you confront the villains."
6,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_06","You easily dispatch the Brass Blades, and their commander and Phelyp offer no resistance. With the situation under control, it would be meet to see how the downtrodden daughter fares."
7,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_07","The downtrodden daughter offers you her profuse thanks, during which time Momozigo, conspicuously absent during the confrontation, returns with Fufulupa and other upright Brass Blades to arrest the criminals. With that, an evil is excised from Ul'dah. Evil, however, knows no rest, and you set off at once for the next city–state on your journey to right wrongs: Limsa Lominsa.

※In order to travel to Limsa Lominsa, you must first complete the main scenario quest “<Switch(PlayerParameter(70))><Case(1)>The Lominsan Envoy</Case><Case(2)>The Gridanian Envoy</Case><Case(3)>The Ul'dahn Envoy</Case></Switch>.”"
8,"TEXT_JOBSAM520_02561_SEQ_08","At the Drowning Wench, you and your companions discuss the next move. While Musosai seeks out evil and injustice in the city with Momozigo's help, he bids you further hone your skills in your art in readiness to contend with whatever villainy should manifest.

※The next samurai quest will be available from Musosai upon reaching level 54."
