3,"TEXT_JOBPLD601_02571_SEQ_03","Among your would-be opponents you see faces both new and old, and the affable adventurer that you are, you take the opportunity to greet each of them. With that settled, perhaps a quick visit to the Gladiators' Guild to speak with your old guildmaster is in order."
4,"TEXT_JOBPLD601_02571_SEQ_04","Welcoming you warmly, Mylla gives you an overview of tournament rules, shortly after which the opening ceremony commences. Making a royal appearance, Nanamo declares the Ul Cup revived and gives her blessing to all combatants. May Nald'thal give strength to your sword arm.
