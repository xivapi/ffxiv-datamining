1,"TEXT_JOBSAM630_02567_SEQ_01","Momozigo hands you a letter sent to you from Makoto. In an elegant hand, she tells of the Sekiseigumi's losing battle against the insurgents led by Ugetsu, your fellow pupil, and petitions your aid in the fight. If you would answer the call, you are asked to come to the Sekiseigumi Barracks in Kugane."
2,"TEXT_JOBSAM630_02567_SEQ_02","Arriving in Kugane, you make your way to the Sekiseigumi Barracks, where you are greeted by a soft-spoken Sekiseigumi. The man informs you that Makoto is away on a reconnaissance mission to Sakazuki, but is quite late to return. Unable to leave his post, he asks that you go and find her in his stead."
3,"TEXT_JOBSAM630_02567_SEQ_03","You find Makoto surrounded by the enemy, her comrade lying still nearby. The insurgents turn their blades upon you, but you deal with them with little trouble. With the danger passed, you may look to your ailing friend."
4,"TEXT_JOBSAM630_02567_SEQ_04","Rising to her feet, Makoto thanks you profusely for rescuing her. Their coming had somehow been made known to the enemy, who received them with an ambush. Her voice laden with sorrow, Makoto tells you about her slain comrade. Hailing from a poor farming village, he joined the Sekiseigumi in hopes of bringing about change to Hingan society─a society that holds people hostage to their birth. Ugetsu and his insurgents, too, seek to bring about change, but they would do so by plunging the entire realm into chaos. Having finished holding forth on her passions, she sees to carrying her comrade back to the barracks and bids you join her there."
5,"TEXT_JOBSAM630_02567_SEQ_05","Back at the barracks, the soft-spoken Sekiseigumi introduces himself as Shiden, lieutenant of the Sekiseigumi. Aside from Makoto, he alone is privy to your identity as Musosai's pupil, a fact you are told to keep secret lest it attract undue suspicion. You are then brought before Captain Kongo, who immediately mistrusts you and makes his sentiments known by way of a drawn blade. Though he is eventually persuaded to sheathe it, he leaves you with a grave warning nonetheless. Shiden apologizes for the captain's outburst, explaining that the man has been under great pressure of late. And to add to their burdens, His Excellency the Tairo, one of the nation's most powerful men, is due to come to Kugane on an embassy visit. The task of providing security falls to the Sekiseigumi, and you are asked to assist when the time comes.

※The next samurai quest will be available from Makoto upon reaching level 65."
