1,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_01","As part of your continuing lessons, Fugetsu has decided that you will accept a commission from one of Kokajiya's clients. Head to Tenkonto and speak with the samurai Gyosei."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_02","You meet with Gyosei, and he explains that he requires a helm for participation in a tournament known as the gozen-jiai. Blanstyr proposes a friendly contest where you both craft a piece, and have the client decide which he likes best. Return to Kokajiya, and discuss the subject of supplies with Unryu."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_03","Before you begin forging, Unryu suggests that you first ask the advice of those with more intimate knowledge of the gozen-jiai. He sends you to speak with the same Sekiseigumi blade you consulted once before, as well as a stallkeeper in the Rakuza District."
4,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_04","After speaking with the blade and the stallkeeper, you learn that a simple somen─a faceplate which protects the head from brow to jaw─is considered the most appropriate headgear for the tournament. Head back to Unryu, and make a request for materials."
5,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_05","Unryu hands over the supplies you need. Deliver your finished work to Fugetsu when the somen is complete.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Unryu."
6,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_06","You deliver your work to Fugetsu, and the master puts it on display next to Blanstyr's piece. Much to Blanstyr's surprise, however, Gyosei chooses your simple somen over your fellow apprentice's elaborate kabuto. Fugetsu chides Blanstyr for prioritizing a selfish desire to express originality over meeting the client's practical requirements, and the veteran artisan admits his fault. Continue your lessons alongside the repentant Blanstyr, and work towards perfecting the arts you have learned in Kokajiya.

※The next armorer quest will be available from Blanstyr upon reaching level 70."

Come on, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Let's go an' meet with this Master Gyosei."

60,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_GYOSEI_000_013","No matter! I shall place my trust in your skill, as Master Fugetsu has clearly done. As for my request, I need you to craft for me new headgear for the gozen-jiai."

74,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_031","I wonder, however, if you are familiar with the gozen-jiai and what might be considered preferable armor. Before you begin, why not ask the advice of those with the relevant experience?"
75,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_032","One such person might be the Sekiseigumi blade who shared with you his ideas on the perfect kote. He will have participated in the tournament in question, and is thus in possession of an invaluable perspective."
76,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_033","Another fine choice would be a stallkeeper in the Rakuza District. Such a merchant will have traded in many types of armor, and could provide you with a broader range of ideas."

80,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_ZOUSENOTOKO02597_000_041","I see, and this time you are to craft headgear for a gozen-jiai participant. First and foremost, the tournament takes place before a significant gathering of the nobility. As such, it is best to avoid ostentatious designs or gaudy color combinations."
81,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_ZOUSENOTOKO02597_000_042","When I myself joined the tournament, I also found it advantageous to wear a facemask which allowed a wide field of vision. That is all I can tell you of armor─your client's success will otherwise rely upon his own skill."
82,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SHONIN02597_000_045","Closer, my friend! Come closer! See anything you like?"
83,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SHONIN02597_000_046","Eh? Headgear for the gozen-jiai? Well, each combatant has his preferences, but most will choose a facemask of some kind. There's the hatsuburi which protects the brow and cheeks, and the somen─a fuller version which stretches further down and across the jaw."
84,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SHONIN02597_000_047","I've seen warriors who bind their head with naught but a hachimaki...and I've seen the same warriors carried out with cracked skulls. A strip of cloth affords poor protection, you'll find."
85,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_ZOUSENOTOKO02597_000_048","Remember to avoid gaudy designs and colors─such choices are considered tasteless when courting noble employers. Also keep in mind that a warrior appreciates an unrestricted view of the battlefield."
86,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SHONIN02597_000_049","You cannot go wrong with a standard facemask. Even in a tournament, a blow to a naked brow can be dangerous..."

88,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_061","A somen, is it? Very well. One moment and I'll see what we have..."
89,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_062","Ah, this should do nicely. Here!"
90,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_063","As always, I will replace your materials should you happen to slip with your hammer. I am a generous quartermaster. Oh, and I believe you are to present your work to Master Fugetsu when it is ready."
91,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_064","If you find yourself in need of more materials, simply ask and I will rummage through my magical shelves. Otherwise you can present your finished work directly to Master Fugetsu."
92,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_065","That is a sturdy-looking somen. Well done. You should probably show it to Master Fugetsu instead of me though."
93,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_070","Blanstyr has explained to me that you plan to have the client choose between his and your work. Do you have your piece ready?"

96,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_073","Aye, but I'll not say who made which. Ye just pick the one what catches yer fancy, sir."

I have made my decision!"
98,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_075","Right, let's hear it, then."
99,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_GYOSEI_000_076","I shall take this somen!"
100,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_077","Now hang on a bloody moment! Yer choosin' the somen over me silver snake kabuto!?"
101,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_078","But...surely ye can't pass up the helm what protects yer whole head!"
102,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_079","An' look at that serpent head! It's a symbol o' good fortune over here, ain't it!? Not to mention how such an original design'll catch the eye of yer prospective employers!"
103,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_GYOSEI_000_080","The gozen-jiai is a tournament─not a life-or-death battle. While certain precautions must still be taken, it is not needful nor desirable to don the heaviest armors available."
104,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_GYOSEI_000_081","And when fighting before the nobility, it is considered tactless to draw attention with aught besides one's skill with the blade. A simple facemask is sufficient to put one's mind in the right frame for battle."
105,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_082","But ye didn't... Can't ye just─"
106,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_083","Enough, apprentice! The client has decided, and the matter is settled!"
107,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_084","Furthermore, it would seem you are in need of instruction regarding the “original” design of your kabuto."
108,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_085","You once confided in me that the sight of a Heavensturn helmet drove you to seek originality in your own work."
109,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_086","I fear, however, that you misunderstand the motive behind the uniqueness of those designs."
110,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_087","The Heavensturn helmets were crafted to reflect the desire of the bugyo to introduce those animals to Eorzea, and foster a fondness for our sacred symbols."
111,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_088","They were not, as you seem to believe, created to exhibit my own personal style as an armorer."
112,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_089","Your efforts to learn and incorporate our culture into your work, and the exquisite detail of the kabuto's embellishments are worthy of praise."
113,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_090","But such grand achievements are meaningless if the resulting piece fails to satisfy the needs and expectations of the client."
114,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_091","...Yer right, Master Fugetsu. Seems that ever since I saw that helm, I've been obsessed with creatin' summat with the same impact..."
