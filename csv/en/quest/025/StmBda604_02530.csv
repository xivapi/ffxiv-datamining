54,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_CONRAD_000_022","So it's finally over, eh? Pray extend to him my deepest thanks."
55,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_ALISAIE_000_023","It's official, then. Castellum Velodyna is well and truly ours. Mayhap this calls for─ Wait, where is M'naago?"
56,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_CONRAD_000_024","She took her bird and flew off towards the Peering Stones─the village of the M tribe, where she was born."
57,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_CONRAD_000_025","I doubt that the imperials who fled Velodyna had a mind to give them trouble on their way back east, but she was nevertheless worried, so I gave her leave to go and see that her people were safe."

66,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_JMOLDVA_100_055","<sniff> <sniff> On your guard, Arenvald. They're still about..."
67,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_VMAHTIA_100_060","Since when did you become a bloodhound? A Miqo'te ought to trust their ears, not their nose."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_PIPIN_000_055","We will soon start sending scouts east to survey the land in preparation for our advance. We do not anticipate much resistance at this time, but should we encounter any imperial forces, we shall deal with them quickly and severely."

70,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_ALPHINAUD_000_065","...But of course. Tiring though it may be to come and go from the clifftop, it is easily defended and affords an excellent view of the surrounding area."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_ALISAIE_000_070","This area is home to dangerous beasts. Naught that we cannot handle, mind, but do not be surprised if something ravenous and slavering comes charging at you out of nowhere."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_LYSE_000_075","Well, what do you think? Hard to tell from down below that a whole village is up here, isn't it?"
73,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_ALPHINAUD_000_080","Not just Seekers of the Sun, but Ananta? Mayhap there is a settlement nearby..."
74,"TEXT_STMBDA604_02530_ALISAIE_000_085","We may not have seen any imperial forces thus far, but we mustn't forget that this was occupied territory until very recently. They could still be nearby."
