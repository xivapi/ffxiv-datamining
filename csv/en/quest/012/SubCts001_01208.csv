Seek further information about this troubling turn of events from the foreman Mimidoa, who bides his time in Aleport."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS001_01208_SEQ_02","Master Mimidoa confirms the dire tidings and implores you to silence the siren's song, that he and his apprentice may get on with their work. Make for Pharos Sirius and speak with Davyd, a guard posted outside."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS001_01208_SEQ_03","Heartened by your arrival, Davyd advises you to enter Pharos Sirius via the flood cellar so as to catch your foe off guard. Rid the lighthouse of the siren and her thralls so that the restoration effort might commence in earnest.

51,"TEXT_SUBCTS001_01208_DIAMANDA_000_003","So I stand here with idle hands. Powerless to avenge his death, powerless to repay my debt to Master Mimidoa─once my father's mentor as he now is mine. The agony of it all! If only my brother were here, he would see to it that..."
