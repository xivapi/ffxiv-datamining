Take the sacks of ash given to you by Narujj Boh, and smother all the beacons you find within the Zanr'ak encampment. Be prepared to defend yourself against any retaliation your efforts incur."

Narujj Boh is well pleased by your deeds, but warns that the Flamefangs will respond with ever greater acts of foolish fanaticism. He vows, however, the Brotherhood of Ash will never surrender in its efforts to restore the ancient and honorable ways of the Amalj'aa."
