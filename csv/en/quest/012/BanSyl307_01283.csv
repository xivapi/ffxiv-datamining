1,"TEXT_BANSYL307_01283_SEQ_01","Moxia explains to you how newborn sylphs sprout forth from “podlings,” which are bulb-like objects that must be incubated deep in the heart of the Sylphlands. With touched sylphs ever looking to steal away podlings to add to their numbers, Moxia would ask your aid in delivering a ready-to-sprout podling back to the safety of Little Solace. Travel to the Seedbed and take the podling in hand."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL307_01283_SEQ_02","You have successfully retrieved the podling. Deliver it to the specified location, where two sylphs of Little Solace await.

※To bolster your strength while carrying the podling, interact with the patches of moongrass that you find along the way."

4,"TEXT_BANSYL307_01283_SEQ_04","Moxia joyously informs you that a healthy little one has sprouted forth from the podling you helped deliver to safety, leading to much rejoicing among the sylphs of Little Solace. She fears, however, that the touched sylphs will not cease their attempt to rob the Seedbed, and asks that you lend your aid again."
