1,"TEXT_BANSYL308_01284_SEQ_01","A great boar by the name of Kafre, once a beloved pet of the sylphs, has gone mad and now runs wild in the Sylphlands, goring all in sight with its fearsome tusks. Distraught at what has become of her erstwhile friend, Moxia makes the difficult but necessary decision of asking you to put the beast down. Participate in the FATE “What a Boar” in the western reaches of the Sylphlands and return to Moxia with proof that the deed is done."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL308_01284_SEQ_02","Moxia is greatly heartened to see the tusk and learn that Kafre was not slain, but merely driven away. Moved at your kindness and courage, she offers her profuse gratitude, while hoping against hope that the great boar might return to Little Solace one day a gentler beast."
