1,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_01","Though unconvinced that searching for the “bumbling one” is worth the trouble, Olmxio nevertheless offers you knowledge that should avail you in your effort. Travel to Larkscall, on the border with the Sylphlands, and survey the area from the specified location."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_02","Your mere presence in the area has scared the malevolent sylphs away, at least for the moment. The danger having abated, return your attention to the scholar Voyce and release him from his bonds."
3,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_03","No sooner did you rescue Voyce from the clutches of his captors than did the skittish scholar flee to the safety of Little Solace. Return and speak with the man to see what he has gleaned in his research of the sylphs."
4,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_04","The scholar Voyce─with some assistance from Elder Frixio─recounts the legend of the Chosen One, a legendary sylph who is reborn once a millennium and is said to possess the power to change the fate of her people. All present fear for what might befall the realm if the Chosen One were to fall into the hands of the malevolent touched sylphs. Speak with Olmxio and see if there is anything that can be done."
5,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_05","Olmxio, expressing grave doubts as to Voyce's abilities, would have you lead the search for the Chosen One. Remain in Little Solace and assist the sylphs as you gather what knowledge you can to prepare for the task ahead."
