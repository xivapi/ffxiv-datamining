2,"TEXT_BANAMA107_01228_SEQ_02","You have tested the sacred ash on the tempered with uncertain results. Return to the Ring of Ash and report to Fibubb Gah."
3,"TEXT_BANAMA107_01228_SEQ_03","Though disappointed at the remedy's apparent failure, Fibubb Gah vows that the Brotherhood will continue its efforts toward creating a cure for the tempered. He muses that perhaps you just might be the one who tests the first successful batch."
