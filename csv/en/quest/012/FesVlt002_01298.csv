※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT002_01298_SEQ_01","Summoning the holy powers of her ancestors, Lady Lisette has divined the identity and location of a young maiden in need of aid to convey the depths of her love. Seek out the lass─Yellow Moon of the Weavers' Guild in Ul'dah─and see what ails her.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT002_01298_SEQ_02","Yellow Moon would return the affection of her many admirers in the traditional Valentione's Day manner─with chocolate─yet her admirers are too many and her kitchen shelves too bare. Travel about town and procure the necessary ingredients from her acquaintances, taking care not to make any unnecessary promises."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT002_01298_SEQ_03","You have procured some most curious ingredients from young men eager to please. Return to the Weavers' Guild and deliver them to Yellow Moon, who is sure to be pleased."

6,"TEXT_FESVLT002_01298_SEQ_06","Yellow Moon continues to slave away at her stove and─perhaps not surprisingly─would be <Emphasis>terribly</Emphasis> appreciative if you could acquire one last set of ingredients for her. It is fortunate the young miss has so many “friends” to help her..."
7,"TEXT_FESVLT002_01298_SEQ_07","You have procured the final batch of ingredients from young men who regard the golden-tressed lass as some sort of deity. Is this stuff even edible? Return to the Weavers' Guild and deliver them to Yellow Moon before you are arrested and tossed in gaol for possession of hazardous substances."
8,"TEXT_FESVLT002_01298_SEQ_08","Yellow Moon rejoices─thanks to your selfless acts, she will be able to fashion a batch of chocolate sizable enough to feed all of her admirers, most importantly her one true love. In an entirely unrelated turn of events, numerous residents of Ul'dah─strangely, all male─have been stricken down by a vile poison. Take your reward, a present from Yellow Moon for your kindness, and make a discreet retreat before you can be implicated in the plot."
