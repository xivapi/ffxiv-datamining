49,"TEXT_BANAMA002_01218_HAMUJIGAH_000_002","For as long as our people have existed, it has been the tradition for aging warriors to make the pilgrimage to the holy land of Zanr'ak, and there confront the specter of death. It is an honor to cast one's time-tempered soul into the sacred flames, and return one's body to ash."
50,"TEXT_BANAMA002_01218_HAMUJIGAH_000_003","But these craven whelps of Zahar'ak quaver before death's inevitability─they seek not to fortify their spirits, instead groveling before a deity for the strength they do not deserve. "

71,"TEXT_BANAMA002_01218_LLOONGAH_000_044","Recall the raiders you but recently faced. They were members of the Flamefangs─a faction among the Zanr'ak Amalj'aa that, more than any other, delights in kidnappings. Naturally, they also draw the most ire of the Brotherhood."
72,"TEXT_BANAMA002_01218_LLOONGAH_000_045","It is our mission to see their ambitions ground into dust and their leaders slain! Indeed, it is the duty of all who would call themselves true Amalj'aa warriors."
