1,"TEXT_SUBCTS002_01209_SEQ_01","Diamanda is overjoyed to hear of your triumph over the siren, the brave deed having served to avenge her father and clear the way for the long-overdue restoration of Pharos Sirius. She urges you to convey the good news to Master Mimidoa in Aleport, that the two might commence their work."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS002_01209_SEQ_02","Good tidings were met with grim revelations, as Master Mimidoa revealed that the crew of undead seamen in the siren's thrall were none other than the wretched remains of Diamanda's beloved brother and his loyal mates. In hearing the painful truth from her master's mouth, the young smith is finally able to come to terms with that which she had long since suspected, and she resolves to devote herself to the restoration effort to honor the memory of her family."
