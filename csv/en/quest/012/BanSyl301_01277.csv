1,"TEXT_BANSYL301_01277_SEQ_01","Moxia fears that excessive consumption of milkroot by the sylphs of the Sylphlands is contributing to their descent into madness. Get at the root of the problem by chopping down milkroot clusters or milkroot saplings, and harvest six bundles of fresh milkroot to prevent the substance from falling into the hands of those who would misuse it."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL301_01277_SEQ_02","You have harvested six bundles of fresh milkroot, decimating the naughty ones' supply in the process. Deliver your haul to Moxia."
3,"TEXT_BANSYL301_01277_SEQ_03","Moxia thanks you profusely for the milkroot, praising its exceptional freshness while giving nary a mention of her original aim in sending you to harvest it. For all her talk of moderation, it is evident that Moxia rather enjoys the root herself. Though it may not be the adventurer's place to begrudge the beleaguered sylph the occasional moment of levity, one can only hope that she knows when to say when."
