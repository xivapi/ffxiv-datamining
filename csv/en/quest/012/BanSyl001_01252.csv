1,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_SEQ_01","Serpent Commander Heuloix is concerned about troubling movements among the sylph tribes, fearing that the typically benign beastmen are hatching a bodeful plot. With the scholar dispatched to investigate the matter having gone missing, the commander bids you go in search. Travel to Little Solace and speak to the sylph Olmxio."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_SEQ_02","Olmxio informs you that a bumbling, spineless fool of a “smart one” has been spending much time in the company of the sylph elder. This hardly matches Commander Heuloix's description of the scholar Voyce, but it should suffice as a starting point for your search. Seek out the sylph elder, Frixio, and see what light he might shed on the matter."
3,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_SEQ_03","Elder Frixio─who seemingly holds Voyce in similarly low esteem─informs you that the scholar set out a few days ago for the Sylphlands. He also expresses considerable doubt as to the likelihood of the scholar returning alive. Return to Olmxio and see if there is anything you might do to rescue the man from harm."
4,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_SEQ_04","Though failing to understand your preoccupation with Voyce's well-being, Olmxio does not dissuade you from your stated aim. He gives you fair warning that the Sylphlands are fraught with many dangers for walking ones such as yourself, and encourages you to prepare thoroughly for the journey ahead."

50,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_VORSAILE_000_003","Allow me to elaborate. In recent weeks, my eye has been drawn to unusual movements among the sylphs, those charming-yet-troublesome beastmen with whom we share our forest home."
51,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_VORSAILE_000_004","In hopes of shedding light on their intentions─be they malicious or benign─I dispatched a young researcher to Little Solace to investigate further. The fellow goes by the name of Voyce─mayhap you have heard of him? It would seem he is rather accomplished in his field."
52,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_VORSAILE_000_005","He set out a fortnight ago, and has been sending regular reports ever since─that is, until some three days past. Though he was quick to assure me that his prodigious intellect and survival skills would ensure his safety, I cannot help but fear he has come to harm."
53,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_VORSAILE_000_006","Such is my request to you: travel to Little Solace and inquire as to the well-being of our man. Seek out the sylph Olmxio, who has oft acted as an intermediary between our peoples. Now go in safety, and in haste. The forest holds many dangers─these days more than ever."
