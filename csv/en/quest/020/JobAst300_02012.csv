Elder astrologian Mace is dragged off at knifepoint by the ruffians, but not before he inconspicuously tosses his soul crystal in the loam for you to find. Mace's granddaughter claims that this turn of events was foretold in the stars, and that it is, and always has been, your fate to take up the crystal.
