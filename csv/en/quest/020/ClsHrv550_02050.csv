1,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_SEQ_01","Mujih informs you that Basyle has need of your expertise once more. Speak with the botanist at Camp Cloudtop and inquire after the particulars."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_SEQ_02","Basyle explains to you his latest dilemma: in order to maintain soil fertility, he wishes to grow crops of the bean family at regular intervals. However, such varieties of beans as are found in Coerthas refuse to grow in the Sea of Clouds. Based on your recommendation, Basyle asks you to return to Gridania to trouble Fufucha for advice."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_SEQ_03","Fufucha believes that the Shroud vetch would be best suited to Basyle's needs. Even so, she does not think it entirely ideal, and suggests that you find another strain with which to cross it and create a new variety. To this end, you must seek the counsel of a specialist─an Ishgardian native versed in local flora. During her time in Ishgard, Mujih may have come to know of such an individual; seek the reporter out at the aetheryte plaza in Foundation."
4,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_SEQ_04","Most fortuitously, Mujih knows just the person you are looking for─the foremost herbalist in Ishgard, a man named Martineau. She offers to arrange a meeting with him, and instructs you to go to Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral, where he will supposedly be."
5,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_SEQ_05","Having marveled at the fine specimens of Shroud vetch, Martineau gives you his recommendation for a crossing match: emerald beans, which can be harvested from lush vegetation in the Churning Mists. Procure ten handfuls of these beans and deliver them to Basyle."
6,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_SEQ_06","Basyle receives the Shroud vetch and emerald beans with thanks. Though it will require time and effort to cross them, he believes that it will be worthwhile in the end. In parting, he informs you that Mujih has left a message asking you to meet her at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard."
7,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_SEQ_07","With great satisfaction, Mujih informs you that the second installment in her series is on its way to <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>. She praises you for your part in Basyle's recent successes, and bids you keep up your efforts.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Mujih Mewrilah upon reaching level 58."

53,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_BASYLE_000_011","This time, I need your help to maintain soil quality. As you know, soil gradually becomes barren with continued cultivation."

55,"TEXT_CLSHRV550_02050_BASYLE_000_013","Alas, such beans as we have in Coerthas refuse to grow here. Unless we do something, I fear the soil will cease to yield crops altogether. Is there aught you can suggest?"
