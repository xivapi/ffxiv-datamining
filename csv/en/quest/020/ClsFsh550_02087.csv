1,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_01","Ansaulme has received an urgent request from your mutual friend Reyna─she has a problem that only one with superlative angling ability can solve. However, as Ansaulme's own business will keep him in Ishgard for the foreseeable future, he asks you to respond to the summons in his place. Meet with Reyna in Tailfeather, the chocobo hunters' camp in the Dravanian forelands, and see what trouble is afoot."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_02","Reyna tells you of the crisis affecting the camp: a school of carnivorous catfish has made its way into the local river system and is fast devouring the fish the colony relies on for its evening meals. Despite their best efforts to catch the invasive wavekin, the chocobo hunters are better archers than anglers, and could benefit from the tuition of a practiced fisher<If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>. Reyna bids you follow the Whilom River to the north and rendezvous with the Tailfeather hunter leading the extermination effort. He will brief you as to where the elusive shadowhiskers can be found."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_03","The Tailfeather hunter informs you that the shadowhiskers have made their lair in the basin of the Hundred Throes. He asks you to catch three specimens to show the increasingly exasperated hunters how it is done. Once you have caught the creatures, return your haul to Reyna to make proof of your success."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_04","Reyna is overjoyed to see what an excellent example you have set the chocobo hunters─now that they are armed with your advice, the shadowhiskers' days are surely numbered. She is eager to reward you in the same manner as before, but despite racking her brains for a suitably fascinating fishing story, she draws a blank. In her desperation, she turns to Sten, a chocobo hunter of notorious taciturnity. To Reyna's great surprise, he recounts a tale of Far Eastern hellfishing the likes of which she has never heard. Keen to try the sport for herself, she asks you to return to Ansaulme to see if he has any knowledge of the magma worms Sten mentioned in his story."
5,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_05","Ansaulme has not only heard of the worms in question, but he has a few of the creatures in his possession. He gives them to you as a reward for responding to Reyna's request on his behalf. Should you wish to try your hand at hellfishing, Ansaulme advises you to travel to the far reaches of the Dravanian forelands, to the fiery lands where the dragons dwell.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Ansaulme upon reaching level 58."

49,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_ANSAULME_000_001","You remember that girl, Reyna─the one who you beat in the fishing contest? Well, she's sent me a message, saying she needs an experienced angler to come and fish her out of a spot of hot water."
50,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_ANSAULME_000_002","She's been trying her hand at a little chocobo hunting over in Dravania─she didn't go into the details, but it seems some problem's cropped up that only a master fisherman can solve."

53,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_ANSAULME_000_005","If that fishing contest proved anything, it's that you know how to handle a rod just as well as I do. I'm sure you'll make a more than adequate stand-in.

56,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_010","Didn't think he was up to the challenge, eh? Well, at least he had the good sense to send along a suitable replacement. You're thrice the fisherman that great galoot is, and it's angling talents I need to get us out of this mess."
57,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_011","For the past few years, I've been coming here to Tailfeather for the start of the hunting season. It's dangerous work, but it has its rewards. Why, just a couple of weeks chocobo hunting can keep a girl in balloon bugs for the rest of the year!"
58,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_012","And after a long day's hard work, there's nothing I like better than to head to the riverbank and catch a few carp for the hunters' supper. The problem is, someone's let a school of carnivorous catfish loose in the river, and they're running riot."
59,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_013","At this rate, they'll have gobbled up every fish in the river before the season's out! I've convinced the hunters to try to catch these monsters before it's too late, but they've had no luck so far. It's no surprise, really─half of them don't even know which bit of the tackle to throw in the water."
60,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_014","That's where you come in─I need you to help me catch a few of these whiskery invaders and show those hunters how it's done. What do you say, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
61,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_015","If my master plan works, it's not only the future of our fish suppers that'll be saved for posterity, but the chocobo hunt itself! After all, you can't catch chocobos on an empty stomach! Isn't that right, Stenny boy?"
62,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_STEN_000_016","........................Hrm."
63,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_017","<sigh> Looks like Stenny's away with the faeries again... I had better stay here and keep an eye on him─we wouldn't want him doddering off into the Whilom and giving those nasty catfish something meatier to wrap their teeth around. Do you think you could put my plan into practice yourself?"
64,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_018","The hunters I sent to catch the catfish should still be upstream somewhere. Just follow the river to the north and you're sure to bump into them sooner or later. They might not have caught any of those pesky pescatarians yet, but like as not they'll know where to find them."
65,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_025","None of the chocobo hunters around here are anglers, but every one of them can track an animal, even underwater. Just follow the Whilom up north and you'll soon bump into them. They'll be able to tell you where those horrible fish are hiding."

68,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_CHOCOBOHUNTER02087_000_032","And d'you know why he did it? To make the chocobos think twice about crossing the river, so the lazy beggar didn't have to hunt so far. As if some fish is going to scare a ten-fulm racin' bird!"
69,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_CHOCOBOHUNTER02087_000_033","The shadowhiskers have put the fear of the gods into all the other river dwellers, though. The fish what've been here all along just ain't quick enough to escape them, so the monsters are having a field day─proper gorging themselves, like."

80,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_STEN_000_065","Long ago, when me grandad's grandad was but a boy, he met with this travelin' trader who'd come over from the Far East to flog his wares. Among this merchant's stock was a bucket o' wrigglin' red worms that seemed aglow with heat. Naturally, the boy asked him what they were all about."
81,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_STEN_000_066","“Them's magma worms, my son,” the merchant said, or some such Far Eastern patter as makes no difference. “Back where I come from, the fisherfolk use 'em as bait. Hook 'em to a steel line and drop 'em in a volcano, an' ye'll pull up fish the like of which ye've never seen.”"
