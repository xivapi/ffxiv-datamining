1,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_01","You learn from Professor Erik that your friend and fellow monk, Widargelt, has cast aside his all-consuming desire for vengeance, and now seeks to rebuild the Fist of Rhalgr. To that end, he has begun taking on pupils, whom he trains at Revenant's Toll. The good professor bids you pay Widargelt a visit, that you might cease worrying about your friend."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_02","Widargelt introduces you to two of his most promising pupils, D'zentsa and O'tchakha, orphans who one day appeared before him. As their senior and his foremost pupil, Widargelt now asks you to assist in their training. Join Widargelt to the southeast of Revenant's Toll."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_03","First, Widargelt asks you to demonstrate your prowess to D'zentsa. Seek her out to the northeast, and defeat any enemies that appear."
4,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_04","You fell your fearsome foe with ease. Turn your attention back to D'zentsa."
5,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_05","You have won D'zentsa's respect and admiration. O'tchakha is next in line to be treated to a display of your sublime skills. Seek her out to the south, and defeat any enemies that appear."
6,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_06","You fell more fearsome foes with ease. Turn your attention back to O'tchakha."
7,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_07","You have won O'tchakha's respect and admiration as well. But as the two friends speak excitedly of training under you, a yell rings out. It appears Widargelt is in danger. Make haste to the place you left him."
8,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_08","You arrive to find Widargelt alone and on his knees, his assailants having since fled. He explains that he was attacked by strange men who fought in the style of monks. During the encounter, a new chakra appears to have opened within Widargelt, though the sensation was unlike anything he has experienced before. For now, return to the safety of Revenant's Toll and rejoin your fellow monks."
9,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_SEQ_09","Widargelt recounts his encounter with the strange men in detail. As he defended himself, his body was racked by a sudden pain as though something had pierced it. While he is certain that a chakra has opened within him, he does not believe it to be the seventh. For lack of an explanation, he declares that he will seek Professor Erik's advice. Should this phenomenon prove to be a new source of power, Widargelt promises to share its secrets with you.

※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 52."

Ugh... This sensation..."
97,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_WIDARGELT_000_305","A new power swells within me. As though a new chakra has opened. Yet it is unlike aught I have felt before."
98,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_DZENTSA_000_306","Tchakha, this area was the site of some famous battle, wasn't it?"
99,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_OTCHAKHA_000_307","Yes, it was─the Battle of Silvertear Skies. Which means that one's chakra can be opened here. Judging by Master's condition, however, I'm inclined to think that something else was the cause."

107,"TEXT_JOBMNK501_02026_WIDARGELT_000_406","I know not. I must ask someone more learned than me. Professor Erik. He is versed in the history of our order. Perhaps he can find more information."
