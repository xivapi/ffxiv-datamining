1,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_01","On his deathbed, Sidurgu's master spoke of a “flame in the abyss,” a concept which Sidurgu and Fray did not understand. In following the creed of their predecessors, they hoped that the meaning would become clear to them in time. Alas, when they intervened to save the life of a young girl, they were marked for death by the order. Fray was captured and executed in a trial by combat, leaving Sidurgu to care for Rielle by himself. Fearing that he cannot handle the task alone, he implores you to join his cause, and you agree. Perhaps now would be a good time to get to know Rielle."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_02","Though somewhat standoffish, Rielle responds to your inquiries as best she can. Satisfied that you have established a rudimentary rapport, Sidurgu interrupts with his latest plan. Since the Temple Knights appear to be convinced that Rielle is some sort of abomination, Sidurgu would first determine if there is anything unusual about her. To that end, he proposes that you seek out a Vanu healer in the Sea of Clouds, as some are said to possess the ability to see their patients' aether. Rendezvous with him in Camp Cloudtop."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_03","For the most part, the Vanu Vanu are disinclined to parley with outsiders. However, they may be willing to grant your request in exchange for a suitable offering. Sidurgu asks that you seek out and slay gastornis for their feathers, as it is said the Vanu use them in their rituals."
4,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_04","You procure the feathers with little difficulty. Journey now into Vanu territory and pray that you can find a healer willing to hear you out."
5,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_05","Fortuitously, you encounter a Vanu healer willing to examine Rielle in exchange for your offering of feathers. Arms held high, she begins chanting, her voice rising in intensity, until she gasps in surprise. A great spirit dwells within her, the healer begins─but before she can finish, she senses others following in your wake and flees. Turning towards the road, Sidurgu readies his sword and bids you search for your pursuers while he guards Rielle."
6,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_06","You come upon Temple Knights, who mark you for a foe at once. The battle is joined and soon ended. Return to Sidurgu and let him know what you found."
7,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_07","With the Vanu healer long gone, there is no reason to remain in the Sea of Clouds. Return to the Forgotten Knight with Sidurgu and Rielle."
8,"TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_08","Cursing the Temple Knights for their savagery, Sidurgu nearly flies into a rage, until Rielle's sudden apology for being the cause of your distress saps the dark knight of his anger. Though the motives of the Temple Knights yet remain a mystery, it is clear now that there is something rather unusual about the young girl they so fervently pursue.

※The next dark knight quest will be available from Sidurgu upon reaching level 54."
