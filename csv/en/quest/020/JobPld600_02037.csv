1,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_01","Hundred Eyes, friend to both Solkzagyl and Constaint, was attacked by a pack of wolves and gravely injured. Constaint went to see him earlier, only to be sent away and told to fetch you, of all people. Attend the injured man and see what he desires."
2,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_02","Resigned to his death, Hundred Eyes asks you to dig up Solkzagyl's grave and give what you find to Constaint. As you look down on the dying man, racked with pain and guilt, you briefly consider pressing him for an explanation, but decide against it for now."
3,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_03","Deep beneath the cold, hard earth, you find not a coffin, but a small chest containing a gallant surcoat. A cry of rage causes you to whirl about, bringing you face-to-face with Constaint, who followed you at a distance. You quickly explain yourself, further confusing the boy. After a moment, he declares that he will have answers from Hundred Eyes and makes for Falcon's Nest."
4,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_04","Alas, whatever Hundred Eyes's reasons were, they will remain forever unknown. The craftsman succumbed to his injuries in your absence, leaving you and Constaint with no one else to press for answers─save for Papashan, who came to Falcon's Nest out of growing concern for your well-being. Stating simply that he must have words with Constaint, he asks that you meet with him at Lancegate, far to the north, and leaves."
5,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_05","You find yourself rather unsurprised by the revelation that Solkzagyl lives, as the former captain reveals himself to be the cloaked man who observed you from atop the cliff at Camp Riversmeet. His was a complex and impenetrable plot to push Constaint towards becoming a paladin and seeking Oathkeeper of his own volition. It is not enough to reclaim Oathkeeper, he states. The sword must be won by a worthy paladin, whose soul is so pure and powerful that all others are driven to yield. However, when two souls cannot reconcile─when one cannot establish dominance, there is but one recourse: a duel. A duel to establish who is truly worthy of Oathkeeper. Though a part of him believes it to be utter nonsense, Constaint is unwilling to renounce his oaths after having come so far─and neither are you."
6,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_06","Though he fights bravely and with conviction, Constaint is clearly no match for you. Yet the true test is yet to come. Jenlyns arrives and accuses Solkzagyl of having already recovered Oathkeeper, and the former captain at last reveals the full extent of his plans: to restore the light of the soul crystal once wielded by the first captain of the Sultansworn. In so doing, Solkzagyl hopes to infuse Oathkeeper with the resplendent light with which it once shone. Donning his armor, he demands that you face him in battle. And so you defeat him as well, establishing dominance over his and Constaint's souls.

For thirty years, as captain of the Sultansworn, Solkzagyl strove to live up to the example set by the order's founder. For thirty years, he tried to make Oathkeeper shine, as it did for the legendary captains of eld. It did, one day, but only for a fleeting moment─before it was taken from him and he forswore his oaths to reclaim it. Though you are not a true member of the order, he believes that the sword will shine for you. Gingerly taking the sword from his hands, you hold it aloft, and for a moment, the world is bathed in light. In witnessing its resplendence once more, Solkzagyl seems to find a measure of peace.

The light fades as you hand the sword to Jenlyns, but the captain does not seem to be disappointed. He invites Solkzagyl to return to Ul'dah, and the former captain agrees─though only as a friend and ally, for to leave the order is to leave it forever."
7,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_07","Constaint struggles to say good-bye to Solkzagyl, but the paladin corrects him, stating that his business in Falcon's Nest is hardly finished, and they will meet again soon. Jenlyns, Papashan, and Solkzagyl set out for Ul'dah, and you and Constaint head back towards Falcon's Nest."
8,"TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_08","Though he has yet to reconcile his feelings towards Solkzagyl, Constaint still intends to be the best free paladin he can be. He bids you farewell, but not before warning you that, should you cross blades again, he means to win.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Jenlyns once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"
