Yet here you are again, forced to risk life and limb to rescue fools who should have armed themselves. All because there is no one else. So be it. Raid the Amalj'aa encampment and rescue the prisoners."

And the beastmen were happy to keep coming, howling with rage for their fallen kin, no matter how many you slew! Fray's chuckling is infectious, and you find yourself sharing <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> grin."
7,"TEXT_JOBDRK400_02056_SEQ_07","Fray suggests you refrain from cleaning the blood from your equipment. Let Isembard see what you accomplished firsthand."
8,"TEXT_JOBDRK400_02056_SEQ_08","Isembard's eyes wander to the bloodstains, only to flee a moment later. You can hear the fear in his voice as he thanks you for saving the pilgrims. Fray ought to find that amusing."
9,"TEXT_JOBDRK400_02056_SEQ_09","Those who have never known true sacrifice quake at the sight of it. You know this because Fray knows this. Extend your hand and prepare for communion."
10,"TEXT_JOBDRK400_02056_SEQ_10","“Serve... Save... Slave... Slay...” The voice drones on, each word resounding in your heart as the tapping of hammer and chisel. “Sacrifice is to renounce that which binds you,” Fray says. “To recognize that which matters─and forsake all that does not.” Serve... Save... Slave... Slay... Fray knows you cannot continue to carry all these burdens. Heed <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> warning, before it is too late.
