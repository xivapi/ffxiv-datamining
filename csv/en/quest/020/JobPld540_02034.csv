0,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_00","Constaint has made an exciting new discovery."
1,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_01","Hidden amongst Solkzagyl's belongings was a journal, the final entry of which contains what appears to be a map of the Gorgagne Holding. Constaint declares that you should sally forth to investigate─though he acknowledges with some shame that you are far better equipped than he to do so."
2,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_02","Though he is lacking in all other equipment, Constaint has managed to resize Solkzagyl's sollerets, which he now proudly wears. Referring to the map, he directs you across the river to the west. Search the area for anything unusual."
3,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_03","In the snowy wastes you come across a gallant coronet, as well as a worrying trail of blood. Return to Constaint and see what he makes of it."
4,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_04","Constaint instantly recognizes the coronet as the one which Solkzagyl once wore. Intrigued by your mention of a blood trail, he suggests that you follow it and see where it leads."
5,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_05","You find another large patch of blood further in the direction of the Dusk Vigil. The trail continues..."
6,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_06","Yet again, you and Constaint discover a large patch of blood. Eager to carry on the search, the boy rushes off towards the west."
7,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_07","Constaint's eagerness nearly costs him his life, as you find him surrounded by assassins of Death's Embrace. After fending off your attackers, you help Constaint to his feet, who observes sudden movement to the west and, without regard for his safety, once more gives chase."
8,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_08","You and Constaint come face-to-face with more assassins of Death's Embrace, preparing to make a final stand. Though they do not seem to be carrying Oathkeeper, Constaint is nevertheless eager to bring them to justice. With sword in hand and Solkzagyl's coronet atop his brow, the boy charges, and you follow. After a pitched battle, the villains are no more."
9,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_09","Constaint is somewhat surprised by how well that went. Return to Falcon's Nest for a well-earned rest."
10,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_SEQ_10","Solkzagyl's is not the only death for which Constaint sought justice. The boy's mother was also a victim of Death's Embrace, murdered when her caravan was attacked on the road to Tailfeather. The former assassins had turned to banditry to survive, taking care to pick targets which would not provoke a response from the authorities. Yet even the least among us deserve a champion, Constaint believes. Though it may not lead him to Oathkeeper, he firmly believes that it is his duty as a paladin to stop Death's Embrace before they strike again.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Constaint upon reaching level 56."

49,"TEXT_JOBPLD540_02034_CONSTAINT_000_001","He marked a spot near the river, though he did not write why. Yet considering how devoted he was to recovering Oathkeeper, surely it has some relation?"
