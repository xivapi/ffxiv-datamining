Travel to Sharlayan's Answering Quarter in the Dravanian hinterlands and rendezvous with Jannequinard to begin your preparations for the final showdown."

4,"TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_SEQ_04","Before you can even attempt to blackmail Sevestre, he reveals that the document contained in Rufin's diary is the only one remaining. The revelation is followed by a violent exchange from which, despite Sevestre's ability to manipulate time itself, you miraculously emerge victorious and retrieve the diary. In a lapse of judgment that could only be attributed to hubris, it appears Sevestre has failed to remove the information which damns him, allowing Lady Leveva to use the diary as leverage to see her grandfather freed and have Sevestre report to the Forum that she has perished on Eorzean soil so she may continue her activities in Ishgard unimpeded by the Old World."

Jannequinard plans to finally unlock the remaining heavens, and Quimperain... He is most likely stuck doing the same thing he always has─suffer his master.
