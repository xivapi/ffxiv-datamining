However, with the aid of a few newly made friends, you succeed in driving off the pirates and are about to deliver the final blow to their captain, when Quimperain falls victim to her highly unoriginal trap. The trap, though, never is given the chance to unfold, when, like a knight in shining armor, Commodore Reyner of the Thalassocratic Navy arrives to chase off the captain and save the day. With all threats either fled or lying strewn about the city in pools of their own blood, you are finally able to attune with the fourth heaven─the Arrow. Return to Ishgard and regale Jannequinard with the grand tale of your adventures in Limsa Lominsa."
7,"TEXT_JOBAST401_02016_SEQ_07","You return to find Jannequinard has already been scolded by Leveva for his absence on your most recent trip. He does, however, claim he spent the time productively─speaking with high-ranking members of the Holy See about the possibility of holding an official audience with Leveva regarding Sharlayan astrology. His labors, unsurprisingly, bore no fruit.

※The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 45."
