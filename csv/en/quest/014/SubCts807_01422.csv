1,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_SEQ_01","Wiscard confides that there are energies at work in every action, which constrain him from seeking payment for a very valuable skill he would teach you. But of course, you are happy to perform a small errand for him in return, and deliver a letter to Rowena."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_SEQ_02","Rowena receives the message with ill grace. Her facility for curses is impressive, but you are left wondering why anyone would fall into arrears with this daughter of the Fury. Your ears still ringing with invectives, return now to Wiscard."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_SEQ_03","From Wiscard's reaction, you get an inkling of what all this talk of energy exchange might mean, and ponder over public persona and private predilections. Rather than go down this primrose path, it might be best to simply purchase whatever tomes from Tataroga you find desirable; only then can you learn the master crafting recipes held within..."

49,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_WISCARD_000_001","Now, what I'm going to do is teach you how to craft a glamour prism. And I will not accept a single gil. Do you know why? Bad energy!"
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_WISCARD_000_002","...No doubt you are ill at ease accepting such a valuable gift without lifting a finger in return. Well, if you feel you <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> do something, you can take this letter to Rowena─with my undying love!"

54,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_ROWENA_000_012","<sigh> Right delusional, that one. Plays at bein' a man, but he's no more than a worm. I'd spit in his eye and tell the world what a puddle o' piss he is, were he standin' before me!"
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_ROWENA_000_013","<Emphasis>Undyin</Emphasis>'s a good sort o' word, though. Tell him I'm doublin' his interest─his debt's goin' to live just about forever! As far as I'm concerned, he can crawl on all fours, lickin' up crumbs and scrabblin' for dropped gil."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_ROWENA_000_014","What a fool. Got plenty o' good wares, but he won't get off his arse and turn 'em into profit. He could get square with me and then some, if he wanted to."
57,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_ROWENA_000_019","Tell him to fall into his pease porridge and die, for all I care. I'll sell off his corse to the resurrection men for a few coppers."

61,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_WISCARD_000_023","...Though not from me. Alas, Mistress Rowena has yoked me to a truly backbreaking debt. She bids me get down to business, and that is what I must do."
