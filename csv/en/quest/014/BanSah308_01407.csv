1,"TEXT_BANSAH308_01407_SEQ_01","According to Seww's spawnbrothers, a pillaged merchantman under the command of the Reavers has seen battle with a Maelstrom warship. Though the Lominsan troops were forced to retreat from the deck of the trading vessel, it seems that several of their soldiers were captured by the pirates as they attempted to withdraw. Seww wishes you to board the Reavers' ship and help the captive soldiers escape before the Maelstrom decides to return with a larger force. Speak with Pahh, and borrow an elbst to carry you to the rail of the merchantman."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH308_01407_SEQ_02","You have freed the captive soldiers. Return to Novv's Nursery and report to Seww."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH308_01407_SEQ_03","Seww is greatly relieved to hear that you were able to free the Maelstrom soldiers from their Reaver captors, and thereby avert the need for further intervention by the Lominsan military. The spawnling compares the Maelstrom to his own clutch, saying that the shorewalker troops share a bond as strong as any blood-related family and will go to extraordinary lengths to save one of their own."
