1,"TEXT_BANSAH301_01400_SEQ_01","Seww has caught word of a Coral Trident strike force assembling for a concerted attack on the Maelstrom's defenses. He reasons that eliminating the leaders of the operation will steal the momentum from the assault. Defeat members of the Sapsa shelfscale, shelfclaw, and shelftooth clans, then slay the clan chiefs when they come forth to avenge their fallen kin."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH301_01400_SEQ_02","You have eliminated the clan chiefs. Return to Novv's Nursery and report to Seww."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH301_01400_SEQ_03","You report your success to Seww, and the young Sahagin is relieved to hear of his violent kin's demise. Though the Sahagin have once again narrowly avoided the threat of full-scale war, Novv's spawnling cautions that the next crop of leaders may very well take up where their shortsighted predecessors left off."
