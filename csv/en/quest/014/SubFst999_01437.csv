To that end, you must solve a riddle hidden in an encoded message, which was written by the famed explorer Winebaud. Valiant Hart also makes mention of a man named Yayaroku, who may be able to offer assistance."

4,"TEXT_SUBFST999_01437_SEQ_04","Through methods mysterious and unknown, you receive a message from the late Winebaud. He praises your efforts to seek out the truth and shares with you a verse of poetry for reasons unknown. Valiant Hart will doubtless wish to hear of these developments."
5,"TEXT_SUBFST999_01437_SEQ_05","Valiant Hart is pleased with your progress, but disappointed that Winebaud did not provide any clues as to the whereabouts of Lalafuto III's secret treasure. Having no other leads, he bids you solve the latest riddle he has deciphered."

10,"TEXT_SUBFST999_01437_SEQ_10","With the aid of your copper gorget, you lay claim to the secret treasure purported to be worth one hundred million gil. Valiant Hart snatches it from your hand, his eyes wild with greed, but his expression soon changes to one of disbelief. The “treasure” Winebaud spoke of was a collection of love poems written by Lalafuto III to his paramour, with whom the sultan wished to elope. His quest for phenomenal wealth having ended in utter failure, Valiant Hart cries out to the heavens in rage, cursing the explorer who valued true love above all else."
