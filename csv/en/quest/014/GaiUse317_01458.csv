1,"TEXT_GAIUSE317_01458_SEQ_01","Minfilia expresses concern that the bustling chaos surrounding the official commencement of Alphinaud's trial company has placed undue stress on Slafborn and his efforts to supervise the growing population of Revenant's Toll. Head outside and offer your aid to the veteran soldier."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE317_01458_SEQ_02","Seemingly unfazed by the arrival of the recruits, Slafborn claims to be more worried about your unending workload. While he is dismissing your concerns, however, your conversation is interrupted by the arrival of an injured group of adventurers. You soon learn that the adventurers─and the provisions they were charged with escorting─were set upon by a band of Coerthan heretics near the border to Mor Dhona. Slafborn asks that you travel to Coerthas and aid House Fortemps in tracking down the stolen shipment meant for the frontier hands of Revenant's Toll. Make your way to Camp Dragonhead and call upon Lord Haurchefant."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE317_01458_SEQ_03","You arrive in Camp Dragonhead to find Lord Haurchefant yet unaware of the reason for your visit. Explain the situation to the head of House Fortemps, and discuss what must be done..."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSE317_01458_MINFILIA_000_001","The inaugural ceremony is set to take place here at the Rising Stones. Tataru is cooperating with Alphinaud to see that all is in readiness, so I'm afraid the recruits themselves have been left to their own devices for the time being."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSE317_01458_MINFILIA_000_002","Quite a number of new faces have arrived in Revenant's Toll of late, and I wonder if Slafborn might not find himself overwhelmed. Would you speak with him and see if there is aught he requires?"
51,"TEXT_GAIUSE317_01458_MINFILIA_000_010","Would you speak with Slafborn and offer to ease his burdens? The town was already fit to burst with adventurers and refugees and the like, and I fear the addition of Alphinaud's recruits has only added to the chaos."
