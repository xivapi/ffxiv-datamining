2,"TEXT_GAIUSE312_01453_SEQ_02","You describe your encounter with the sylphs' guardian deity to the Elder Seedseer. The words of Ramuh appear to resonate with Kan–E–Senna, and she is unable to refute the Lord of Levin's claim that wherever man wanders, darkness follows closely behind. You exit the Lotus Stand at the conclusion to your audience, leaving Gridania's leader troubled and thoughtful despite the news of your victory. Report the details of your meeting to Papalymo who awaits you at Nophica's Altar."

Before divulging anything more, however, the Antecedent suggests you first listen to Urianger's latest discovery concerning the nature of the Ascians' immortality. Could it be that the scholar has stumbled upon a means to bring about the permanent destruction of the Paragons?"
