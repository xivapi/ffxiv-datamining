1,"TEXT_BANIXA007_01492_SEQ_01","Desperate to have Tataramu back at work on the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>, Sezul has asked that you approach a member of Highwind Skyways directly. Head to the airship landing in Gridania, and find a Skyways employee who might know of Tataramu's present whereabouts.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA007_01492_SEQ_02","Despite being summarily dismissed by Chairman Tatabaru's private clerk, you learn that she will soon join the head of Highwind Skyways on a journey to the Observatorium. Make your own way to the Coerthas central highlands, and question the private clerk once more."

4,"TEXT_BANIXA007_01492_SEQ_04","Though you have found Tataramu, it appears that his movements are being monitored by the wine-swilling retainers in the next room. The young man suggests that you consult Templeton, and contrive a method by which Tataramu can escape without risking undue notice. Speak with the Skywinds employee in the Observatorium's crafting facility."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA007_01492_SEQ_05","You speak with Templeton, and the devious craftsman suggests the use of a potent sleeping potion mixed into a half-empty bottle of wine. Take the bottle and surreptitiously place it on the table in the room where the mercenary guards are drinking."

7,"TEXT_BANIXA007_01492_SEQ_07","You report the success of Templeton's plan to an astonished Tataramu. Well aware of his guards' proclivity for drinking, the airship designer deems the sellswords sufficiently insensate to risk a swift dash through the door. Head outside and rendezvous with Tataramu."

Return to Ehcatl and rejoin Sezul."
9,"TEXT_BANIXA007_01492_SEQ_09","Sezul is overcome with emotion at Tataramu's return. No sooner has the chief mastered his tears and ordered the designer back to work, however, than the Ixali chieftain of the nearby logging ground makes an unexpected and unwelcome visit. Cawing with triumph at his discovery of the hidden camp, the exultant chieftain promises an unpleasant fate for the Ehcatl Nine. Sezul and his crew must now race to complete the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> before the Natalan Ixal arrive to destroy all that they have worked to accomplish..."
