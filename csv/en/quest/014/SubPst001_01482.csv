1,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_01","The deputy postmoogle has entrusted you with a letter. Your assignment, which he assures you will be a pleasant one: deliver it safely to the hands of Mother Miounne, proprietress of the Carline Canopy in Gridania."
2,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_02","Pleased to receive good tidings, Miounne shares with you the story of two Lalafells befriended by her grandfather in days gone by. Father and daughter, they overcame initial ostracism to raise a great waterwheel that still stands as a symbol of Gridania to this day. Miounne would visit the wheel with you, but before that asks that you pick four carline blossoms from around town."
3,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_03","You have picked four carline blossoms at Miounne's request. Return to the Carline Canopy and present them to her."
4,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_04","Smiling upon seeing the flowers you picked, Miounne offers to show you the waterwheel as promised. Make for the Central Shroud and wait for Miounne in the vicinity of the Jadeite Flood."
5,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_05","Miounne shares with you the touching tale of Figaga, the Lalafellin girl who saw her stricken father's dream to fruition. Through passion and force of will, she became a master builder and raised the great waterwheel that now bears her name...before she tragically succumbed to the same illness that took her father. Miounne pays her respects at this brave woman's final resting place before returning to the Carline Canopy, named for Figaga's favorite flower. Join her there, that she might share with you the rest of the story."
6,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_06","Back at the Canopy, Miounne explains how she converted the old cabin into the establishment it is today to carry on the spirit of her dear departed grandfather, who spared no effort in welcoming the various peoples who came to Gridania seeking a new home. It is in this same spirit that she accepted her current position with the Adventurers' Guild. Miounne reflects upon her fated meeting with you, and expresses her joy and anticipation at the many meetings with new adventurers that yet lie ahead."

56,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_MIOUNNE_000_014","How did it go again? Ah, yes... Many years ago, when I was no taller than the counter before us, a Lalafellin artisan and his daughter came here to the Twelveswood."
57,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_MIOUNNE_000_015","Of the circumstances which brought them here I know little, for the father was a man of few words. What I do know is that they had left behind their home, traveling far and wide across the realm before settling on Gridania as their new home."

75,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_MIOUNNE_000_045","People laughed─who was this shy little girl with yellow blossoms in her hair? But within a year's time, all could see that the girl was a prodigy with a hammer. In five years, she had mastered skills that would take an ordinary carpenter a lifetime. In ten, her father's dream had become a reality."

77,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_MIOUNNE_000_047","Ah, to think of the wonders she might still have wrought! Alas, not long after completing her Gift to us, she succumbed to the same foul plague that took her father."
78,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_MIOUNNE_000_048","Though she is with us no more, she remains an inspiration for the women of Gridania, myself first among them. It is here, in view of the father and daughter's greatest accomplishment, that I buried their ashes and built a small monument to their memory."
