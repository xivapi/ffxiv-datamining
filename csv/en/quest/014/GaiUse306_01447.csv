1,"TEXT_GAIUSE306_01447_SEQ_01","As you and Alphinaud discuss your next course of action, you are reunited with the young girl from Stonesthrow. Having learned of your desire to find the merchant who recruited her parents, she sought you out in the hopes that you might lead her to them. Although he clearly has no desire to do so, Alphinaud offers to assist the girl with her search. Soon after you are contacted by Minfilia, who requests you return to the Rising Stones immediately. The situation in the Twelveswood has taken a turn for the worse, and you will likely be asked to intervene."
