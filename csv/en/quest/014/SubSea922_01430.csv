2,"TEXT_SUBSEA922_01430_SEQ_02","Wawalago and Ascelyn bend your ear until you can hardly stand straight─such is scholarship. All you need to note is that Wawalago needs a titanic sawfish from you. Take a lugworm to Cape Westwind to catch a Merlthor goby, then perform fishwheeling to net a wahoo. Another round of fishwheeling─or mooching, if you must─will allow you to get your hands on a titanic sawfish."

Heed his gory tale well and equip yourself with care. Without a high <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>gathering<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> value, you will lose this beast ere you can raise it out of the water."
4,"TEXT_SUBSEA922_01430_SEQ_04","Wawalago regards the Navigator's brand with naked hunger, but has the wherewithal to officially recognize you as a fisher with skill enough to capture an Old One, if such a need were to arise. The guildmaster also reminds you that Eorzea is apparently full of big fish for a self-improving fisher to hone his skill on. Word is that rare fish will fetch a handsome price in equipment at Revenant's Toll, unless you prefer to consume several dozen servings of a lemon herb Old One on a bed of spinach."
