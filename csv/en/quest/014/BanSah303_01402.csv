1,"TEXT_BANSAH303_01402_SEQ_01","Seww has informed you that the Serpent Reavers have been seen moving prisoners deeper into the Sapsa Spawning Grounds. Certain that the captive soldiers will be─or possibly already have been─subjected to “drowning,” Novv's spawnling is concerned that the incident will trigger an aggressive Maelstrom response. Head to the spawning grounds and free as many imprisoned soldiers as possible, and, failing that, defeat any drowned thralls."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH303_01402_SEQ_02","You have freed all of the imprisoned soldiers─in one way or another. Return to Novv's Nursery and report to Seww."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH303_01402_SEQ_03","Upon hearing your report, Seww muses on the origins of the Sahagin's Serpent Reaver allies. Though the tattooed pirates are willing followers of Leviathan, the young beastman warrior has witnessed the destructive consequences of their efforts to force others into their faith. Continue to aid Seww when he calls upon you, and do what can be done to limit the damage caused by these kidnapping raids."
