Sezul has one last task he would have you perform.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 18 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 49 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_01","Sezul declares that the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> requires but a few finishing touches before it can be considered complete. Eager to conclude preparations for the test flight, the excitable Ixal has chosen you to craft the final part. Take the component materials given to you by Chief Totoloc, and present them to Hildeyerd at Fallgourd Float.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_02","You present the materials to Hildeyerd, and the cheerful supervisor prepares her facility to accommodate your task. Craft a high-quality finishing component, and deliver it to the waiting Sezul.

Just as the Ixali chief rejoices at the prospect of a complete <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>, however, his celebrating is cut short by sobering news: the fanatics of Natalan have begun preparations to launch their war balloons in an attack on Ehcatl. Travel to Natalan in the Coerthas central highlands, and consult with Tuzal Toltan the Unseen on how to sabotage the impending assault."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_04","After arriving in Natalan, Tuzal Toltan explains to you the elemental workings of the zealots' vortex array and the method by which it can be disabled. Take one of Tuzal's corrupted crystal shards and use it to sabotage the nearby vortex turret as suggested."

8,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_08","You have disabled all the turrets in the vortex array and interrupted the flow of elemental power. With the airstones thus deprived of energy, the war balloons should now lack the propulsion needed to drive them to Ehcatl. Return to Tuzal Toltan the Unseen and report your success."
9,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_09","Stating that he will carry word of your actions back to Chief Totoloc, Tuzal bids you keep watch on the movements of his crafty kin. Travel to the Observatorium and rendezvous with Tataramu."
10,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_10","Upon meeting Tataramu, you learn that another vortex turret remained hidden and untouched somewhere within Natalan─providing enough energy to power the airstone of a single war balloon. The young man's despair is palpable as he spots the ominous vessel floating steadily towards Sezul's camp. His dark mood is suddenly dispelled, however, when Tatabaru's airship, the <Emphasis>Blackjack</Emphasis>, appears and rams the Ixali craft out of the sky. Return to Ehcatl and report events to Sezul."
11,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_11","As Sezul is gloating over the news of his enemy's misfortune, Tatabaru and his entourage arrive in the camp. The chairman apologizes for his previous behavior, and claims an earnest desire to now see the dreams of the Ehcatl Nine come true. The final round of pre-flight inspections has begun. Speak with Tataramu, and see what aid you can provide."
12,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_12","You approach Tataramu, and the excited airship designer reveals that he has been working on a figurehead for the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. Hoping that Sezul will approve the design, Tataramu asks that you speak with the Ehcatl Nine leader before crafting the final component for the figurehead. Present the component materials to Sezul and seek the Ixal's blessing."
13,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_13","You hand the component materials to Sezul, and the chief immediately realizes what Tataramu has in mind. Impressed and pleased by the traditional Ixali design, Sezul bids you craft the final part with particular care. Use the materials returned to you to synthesize a high-quality figurehead component, and deliver it to the waiting Tataramu.

Tataramu takes the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> up into the air, but is almost immediately caught in the grip of violent turbulence. The entire camp watches anxiously as the young man manages to master the wild currents and pilot the airship out of danger. The test flight is a resounding success. Speak with Tataramu and hear his breathless account of events."
15,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_15","Though extremely satisfied with the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>'s inaugural performance, Tataramu has already set his sights on loftier goals.

16,"TEXT_BANIXA008_01493_SEQ_16","Attempting to hide her own forgetfulness, Lieutenant Scarlet praises you on the success of your assigned duty─it appears that your actions have foiled whatever plans the Natalan Ixal had to assault Gridania's defenses. Unbeknownst to the Twin Adder officer, however, you have also helped to prove that friendship and understanding between the feathered beastmen and the forest people is attainable through the pursuit of common purpose.
