1,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_SEQ_01","According to Minfilia, the Order of the Twin Adder believes that the primal Ramuh has been summoned within the borders of the Black Shroud. The Antecedent bids you answer the request of the Elder Seedseer, and offer your aid to the people of the forest. Travel to Gridania and report to Serpent Commander Vorsaile Heuloix at the Adders' Nest."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_SEQ_02","Serpent Commander Heuloix seems much relieved at your arrival. Though eager for you to begin your mission, he asks that you first meet with Kan–E–Senna at the Lotus Stand to discuss diplomatic alternatives. Speak with the silent conjurer at Nophica's Altar to gain admission."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_SEQ_03","The Elder Seedseer confirms that the primal Ramuh has indeed been summoned forth by the natives of the Sylphlands. Loath to sacrifice the hard-won peace with the sylphs, she asks that you attempt to parley with the Lord of Levin before resorting to force. Travel to Little Solace in the East Shroud and report to the serpent lieutenant who will brief you on how to proceed."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_SEQ_04","After welcoming you to Little Solace, the serpent lieutenant informs you that an investigation is already underway to determine where the primal Ramuh might be found. Bide your time until such time as the report is delivered, then speak with the lieutenant once more."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_MINFILIA_000_001","Rest assured, I should not have summoned you were it not urgent. To business, then: I have received some most disturbing news from the Order of the Twin Adder. They have reason to believe that the sylphs may have called forth their revered guardian─the primal Ramuh."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_THANCRED_000_002","I'm sorry, “may have”? Then it is not certain?"
52,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_MINFILIA_000_003","The Elder Seedseer informs us that the elementals themselves murmur of the Lord of Levin's return to the forest. The Sylphlands, however, display no signs of undue commotion."
53,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_004","Forgive me, Antecedent, but that fact need not contradict the elementals' testimony. Unlike his more bellicose compeers─Garuda and so on─Ramuh is reputed to act only in the defense of his children."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_005","I imagine he would soon make his presence known if any were foolish enough to directly endanger the sylphs or their territory."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_YSHTOLA_000_006","The abruptness of this development concerns me. Were we not keeping a close watch on the “touched ones” and their movements?"

60,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_YDA_000_011","You know how the sylphs feel about people poking around in their territory."
61,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_YDA_000_012","They already summoned Ramuh once right after the Calamity, but that was because the Garleans came tramping through the forest..."
62,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_013","...And so long as Castrum Oriens stands, the sylphs cannot be blamed for wishing to have their guardian deity on hand."

64,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_015","And I maintain that observation would have remained the best policy had it not been for the sudden influx of strangers into the Black Shroud. That, alas, we did not foresee..."
65,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_016","By all accounts, the recent violence in Ul'dah drove a number of refugees to seek safety under the concealing canopy of the trees."
66,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_017","'Tis like that the sylphs perceived this panicked migration as yet another invasion, and quickened their efforts to summon their god."
67,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_YSHTOLA_000_018","I am put in mind of Titan and the kobolds. Once again, it is the affairs of men which have paved the way for a primal's coming."
68,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_019","Indeed. One cannot help but wonder what manner of place Eorzea would be without the “civilizing influence” of mankind... Be that as it may, this regrettable development <Emphasis>does</Emphasis> afford us a unique opportunity."

70,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_021","I wonder...might one who has treated with the sylphs so fruitfully in the past not achieve similar success with their patron deity?"
71,"TEXT_GAIUSE307_01448_PAPALYMO_000_022","If Ramuh can be convinced of our intentions, it may be the first step to breaking the cycle of primal summoning."
