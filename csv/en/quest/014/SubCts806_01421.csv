1,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_01","You are a tad fuzzy on the details, but, with a wink and a nod, Wiscard has sent you off to deliver a leather bag to Rowena. You can only hope that his promises of newfound performance and fashion have merit."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_02","You have conveyed the bag and Wiscard's well-wishes to Rowena, with explosive results. Try to think happy thoughts as you hasten back to the flamboyant trader."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_03","Wiscard practically writhes in ecstasy at Rowena's loathing, proving that one truly does create one's own reality. He presents you with a glamour prism, which has the power to make one object look like another. Now you, too, can look the part of a successful adventurer!"

49,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_001","Now, allow me to segue into the first person so we can get down to business. And that business is...you! And <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>sister<Else/>brother</If> adventurer, are not looking so good."
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_002","In fact, it hurts the entire adventurer brand to have you walking about looking the way you do.

51,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_003","Now, I can help you. In fact, I'm probably the only person who can. For just a small service rendered, I can show you how to perform better, and─even more importantly─<Emphasis>look</Emphasis> better!"

53,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_009","What's that? You find your conversation skills lacking? Hah, nonsense! I could tell immediately you're special. Let me guess: felt like the odd one out as a youngling, right? When you get back, you're going to tell me all about it!"
54,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_ROWENA_000_010","Hm? Somethin' from ol' Wiscard? And he <Emphasis>winked</Emphasis> at you, too? Gods, this should be rich. Well, let's have it, then."
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_ROWENA_000_011","...A leather bag? I was right: this <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> rich. That stinkin' sack o' goobbue shite! You know what he sent?"

66,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_025","But don't take my word for it! Now that you have a glamour prism of your own, see for yourself. The best minds in the arcane arts agree: ninety–nine out of a hundred prefer glamour!"
