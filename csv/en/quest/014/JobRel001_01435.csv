2,"TEXT_JOBREL001_01435_SEQ_02","Hailing from the Near Eastern city–state of Radz–at–Han, Jalzahn reveals himself to be none other than the genius mind behind Thavnairian mist, the elixir which you used to enhance your relic. According to the alchemist, your weapon can be raised to new heights of power through the use of crystalline objects he calls atma. Twelve unique pieces are required, and these can be obtained by equipping a relic weapon zenith and participating in FATEs in the following regions:
- Central Shroud: Atma of the Maiden
- Southern Thanalan: Atma of the Scorpion
- Upper La Noscea: Atma of the Water-bearer
- East Shroud: Atma of the Goat
- Eastern Thanalan: Atma of the Bull
- Middle La Noscea: Atma of the Ram
- Western Thanalan: Atma of the Twins
- Outer La Noscea: Atma of the Lion
- Lower La Noscea: Atma of the Fish
- North Shroud: Atma of the Archer
- Central Thanalan: Atma of the Scales
- Western La Noscea: Atma of the Crab

※Upon collecting all pieces of atma, present them to Jalzahn to complete the enhancement process."
