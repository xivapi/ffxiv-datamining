4,"TEXT_LUCKMB119_03320_SEQ_04","Joining you inside Lyhe Ghiah, Feo Ul declares that, by the laws of Il Mheg, you should rightly take your defeated foe's place as king. Before you can ponder a life spent frolicking with the faeries, however, your beautiful branch shoulders this burden in your stead. Thus empowered, the pixie leads an army to Lydha Lran and repels the invading Eulmoran forces. Though your struggles are far from over, the day─or rather, the night─is yours."

With the Lightwarden's defeat, you are one step closer to accomplishing your goal, and under their new ruler, it is not impossible that the faeries may one day prove useful allies...assuming, of course, they feel like it."

And while it is plain we've not seen the last of General Ran'jit, I for one am glad to delay our reckoning with him awhile longer."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMB119_03320_ALISAIE_000_035","It seems I was wrong about your friend. Had Feo Ul not stepped in, you'd be frolicking with the faeries by now."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMB119_03320_THANCRED_000_040","Well done, my friend. You put me to shame, laying low a Lightwarden while I struggle to land a blow on a man old enough to be my great-grandsire."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMB119_03320_RYNE_000_045","I'm going to train harder. Having seen what you've achieved, it's the least I can do."
