49,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_001","Aha, got you! Now, I just need you to do this <Emphasis>brief</Emphasis> survey for me. It will only take a few moments of your time."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_002","Speak to the people on that list, and then return here and tell me your thoughts on the current state of the Crystarium. Your cooperation is appreciated!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_003","No, you've already accepted the list─there's no taking it back now!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_ROSARD_000_010","Good day, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>. What brings you here?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_ROSARD_000_011","Ah, a survey, is it? In that case, I shall gladly tell you of our facility!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_ROSARD_000_012","Here in Ballistics, we store and maintain the weaponry used in defense of the Crystarium. Before you, you see our pride and joy─the crystal cannons!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_ROSARD_000_013","These truly inspiring pieces of artillery unleash blasts of pure aether drawn from the crystal itself. The destructive power they boast will even obliterate most sin eaters, if you can believe it!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_ROSARD_000_014","It's slightly unfortunate that they're so difficult to aim, I'll admit─but that's nothing that the addition of a few more cannons can't solve! Just try to dodge a dozen different blasts coming in your general direction, you creepy bastards! Bwahaha!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_ROSARD_000_015","Ahem. That's the idea, anyway. I suppose I should let you get on with touring the other facilities─but if you have any more questions, you know where to find me."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_ROSARD_000_016","I'd offer to give a demonstration of the cannons, but people around here tend to get a bit testy when I blow holes in the walls. The explanation will have to suffice for now, I'm afraid."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_TRANSPORTER03344_000_020","Roped into one of Pitrig's surveys, were you? I'll try to keep this brief, then─for both of our sakes. And anyway, you're likely already aware that amaro are vital in the distribution and transport of goods, fleet and hardy as they are."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_TRANSPORTER03344_000_021","They can't transport as much in one go as a chocobo-drawn carriage, of course, but the time saved by their ability to fly more than makes up for that. There's no faster way to get something to the settlements and fortifications in Lakeland than by amaro, that's for certain."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_TRANSPORTER03344_000_022","You stand now in the primary area for loading goods for transport, and as you can see, the launch platform extends behind me. If you want the amaro to carry <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>, rather than a parcel, that can be arranged here as well─you need only speak to the tamers at the counter."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_TRANSPORTER03344_000_023","In fact, if you have not yet had the opportunity to ride an amaro, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do so while here. It's more comfortable than it looks, owing to the softness of their coats. Take that as my parting advice to you."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_TRANSPORTER03344_000_024","If you're considering taking my advice to try riding an amaro, you should visit the counter by the launch platform. The trainers will be happy to assist you."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_SZELGUANLEU_000_030","This? This is Temenos Rookery, where we breed, raise, and train beasts of burden."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_SZELGUANLEU_000_031","You might have noticed that the staff is primarily Zun. That is because, as a formerly nomadic tribe, the Zun developed the majority of the techniques for amaro husbandry that are still in practice today, and many of us are trained in them from an early age."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_SZELGUANLEU_000_032","I personally pride myself not only on knowledge of my trade, but also the ability to impart it to others. It is much easier to learn something than to teach it, but unless each of us makes the effort to do both, all our ancestors strove for will someday be lost to time."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_SZELGUANLEU_000_033","I hope that you, too, will learn much about what we do in the Crystarium, that you might someday share it."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_CHANTILDE_000_040","Oh! Can I assist you in locating a particular volume?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_CHANTILDE_000_041","Pitrig sent you to learn of the Cabinet of Curiosity? Very well─I shall endeavor to grant you insight into its purpose."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_CHANTILDE_000_042","The many books that surround you have been collected from every corner of Norvrandt. Tomes of philosophy, history, art─but also faerie tales and personal memoirs."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_CHANTILDE_000_043","Any written work, regardless of its level of sophistication or monetary value, is a significant, if small, portion of our collective knowledge. And that knowledge, as a whole, is what the Cabinet contains."
72,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_CHANTILDE_000_044","Of course, there are others far more versed in the depth and breadth of the collection than I. Have you spoken with Moren?"
73,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_CHANTILDE_000_045","Excellent. Well, if ever you are interested in perusing tomes pertaining to a particular subject, either he or I would be more than happy to assist you. And for our part, we would welcome the addition of any volumes that you may happen upon during your travels."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_CHANTILDE_000_046","The Cabinet may seem vast, but our collection must keep growing. There were once as many books in the world as stars in the sky─and someday there shall be again. If we cannot recover what was lost, we will rewrite it."
75,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_050","You've returned! So tell me─how do you find the Crystarium, thus far?"
76,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_Q1_000_051","What will you reply?"
77,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_A1_000_052","I am impressed by the various facilities it houses."
78,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_A1_000_053","I think its people are remarkably conscientious."
79,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_A1_000_054","I am neither satisfied nor dissatisfied."
80,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_055","As am I! They're the fruit of many years of laborious effort on the part of the citizenry. Here in the Crystarium, everyone contributes to bettering the city."
81,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_056","Right you are! Everyone here in the Crystarium has a part to play, and they do so with passion and dedication."
82,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_057","Hmm, that is a rather vague answer. Perhaps I ought to refine the potential responses into a list of several specific choices? In which case, I'll need to conduct a survey about replying to surveys..."
83,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_058","One of my own roles, by the by, is to conduct research for the Settlement council. We want our work to reflect community values and address outstanding areas of need─and the opinions of those who are newly come to the city are always valuable in that respect."
84,"TEXT_LUCKZA002_03344_PITRIG_000_059","On behalf of the council, I thank you for taking the time to respond. And I assure you that your personal information will be kept strictly confidential."
