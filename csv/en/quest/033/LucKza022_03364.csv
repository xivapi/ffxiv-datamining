48,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_000_001","That Ghin Gin worries about his son more than is healthy. For either of them. But perhaps I'm not so different. I had to leave my daughter behind in the Crystarium while I oversee trade with Mord Souq, and I've not been back for some time."
49,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_000_002","I'd like to send her a gift, to let her know we haven't forgotten about her. Only thing is, I've no idea what young women are interested in these days. I'd ask the others, but I don't want them to think I'm doting on her."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_000_003","I was wondering if you could find out for me? Lorotte over there has a daughter about the same age as mine. I expect she'll know what would make for a decent present."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_100_003","Of course, something that's not too big or expensive would be ideal."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_LOROTTE_000_010","A gift for a young lady? Let me guess, Thaymoth sent you to ask me, didn't he?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_LOROTTE_000_011","We all know how much he misses that girl of his. He tries to put on a brave face, but deep down, he's a big softie."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_LOROTTE_000_012","Anyway, in answer to your question, the Mord make the most beautiful jewelry from precious stones and valuable relics excavated here in Amh Araeng."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_LOROTTE_000_013","I'll bet you don't see many of those around the Crystarium. How about something like that?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_LOROTTE_100_013","Come to think of it, I wouldn't mind something like that myself."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_000_020","Mord jewelry? I'll admit, that never would've occurred to me, but it's a fine choice. From what I recall, Ghin Gin deals in wares like that."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_000_021","If I write a letter to him, would you be so kind as to deliver it to Mord Souq? I'll leave the particulars to him, since I don't know the first thing about gems and whatnot."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_000_022","Oh, and by the way, you don't suppose Lorotte cottoned on, do you?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_000_023","Bloody hells, nothing gets past her! I might as well ask her myself next time, but I appreciate your help."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_THAYMOTH_100_023","That Ghin Gin certainly is a strange one, but I daresay he knows a lot more about jewelry than I do. I'll leave the design and so on in his capable hands."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_GHINGIN_000_030","Oh, welcome back! I take it everything went well with Thaymoth?"
63,"TEXT_LUCKZA022_03364_GHINGIN_000_031","A letter, hmm? <mumble> ...jewelry...daughter...Crystarium... <mumble> I see! Yes, I know just the thing!"
