49,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_001","These days it seems there're more pests than people living in Stilltide, what with all the hopefuls running off to Eulmore."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_002","Those flying lizards are the worst of the lot, though. You can't even leave for an honest day's work anymore without a swarm of them flapping sky demons nipping at your heels from here to Governor's Row."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_003","And don't get me started on their leader! “Jaculus,” we call him. With the way that vicious blighter comes after you, you'd think he bloody owns the place!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_004","Ugh, <Emphasis>someone</Emphasis> needs to topple that little tyrant. None of us fancy losing a finger, but maybe you're up to the challenge?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_005","If you're keen to draw him out, just skewer a couple of his broodmates. That'll get his attention soon enough."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_010","Did you say you were going to gut that territorial lizard leader for us? Like I said, just murder some of his mates, and you'll soon get an audience with Jaculus himself."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_021","If you hadn't done the deed, I was afraid we'd start running out of food. And I've no wish to watch anyone starve to death..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_022","Aye, I know we could move to Gatetown and live on handouts of meol like the rest of them, but we have our pride."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_023","It's not like we could just move to Gatetown and live on handouts of meol anymore. Did you know that stuff was the flesh of sin eaters? <shudder> No bloody thank you."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZA008_03350_CATTY_000_024","If there's any choice in the matter, we'd rather take care of our own needs while we can...with a little help from battle-savvy travelers such as yourself, of course!"
