49,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_001","If it please you, please give me your patronage. As my patron, I ask that you remove the noxious mushrooms that grow in our cave. Flamespores, they're called."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_002","We would tend to them with magicks, except they leave behind a harmful ash. We've no choice but to pluck them one at a time."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_003","Now, you will be curious as to what I have to offer. I am a purveyor of wares that will aid you in your travels. In exchange for your fitting payment, I will give you my choicest items!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_010","Please let me know when you have removed all the flamespores. Scour every corner of the cave, leave no stone unturned!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_020","You've already removed the flamespores? How very quick you are!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_021","Oh, but did you perchance search by the western entrance as well? I'm told that more have cropped up in that area."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_030","I'm told more flamespores have cropped up by the western entrance. Please tend to them as well!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_SYSTEM_000_040","As you pluck the last of the flamespores, you sense a gaze from the entrance."

60,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_050","Ah, you are returned. Have you dealt with the flamespores by the western entrance as well?"
61,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_051","Excellent! No more poisonous spores irritating our noses, for a little while at least!"
62,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_052","Oh dear, I believe I'm getting sentimental. Having a patron again...it reminds me of the old days. Fair every day, I would carry my wares to the castle to offer in exchange for men's patronage."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_053","Back then the castle wasn't called Lyhe Ghiah. The Voeburtites built it, and they named it Gruenes Licht."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_054","It was their last bastion in the struggle against sin eaters. And now they're gone, all of them. Nobles and knights and commonfolk alike..."

66,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_056","And if you desire anything else I possess, I would be glad to offer them to you─for a fitting price, of course!"
67,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_SYSTEM_000_057","Ys Gyuf's shop is now open for business!"
68,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_058","Now, will you be offering your patronage to anyone else? If so, would you consider Wyd Lad?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_059","They've been under the weather of late, and the chance to perform an honorable task would cheer them up."
