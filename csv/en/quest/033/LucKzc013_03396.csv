49,"TEXT_LUCKZC013_03396_LADKENN_000_001","Then the tales are indeed true─it was the giant beaver of legend. Those pixies who encounter it vanish, never again to be seen. That's why we are strictly warned against going to Phisor Lran."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZC013_03396_LADKENN_000_002","Yet though we know to fear the beaver, we know little and less about it. Whence did it come and to what end does it make us disappear? The creature is shrouded in mystery. What could possibly be its desire...?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZC013_03396_LADKENN_000_003","It wants milk, you say? That must be the tribute it demands, else more pixies will meet a terrible end!"

56,"TEXT_LUCKZC013_03396_UINHAGAN_000_011","Of course, here's the milk. Incidentally, it's Kenn Gyuf's favorite thing. Where in the world could they have disappeared to...?"
