48,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_000","Pardon me for staring─I couldn't help but notice that you have the posture of one who has trained in martial techniques. Might I beg your assistance with a small matter?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_001","A friend of mine has recently joined the guard, you see. I was hoping to put my skills to work in crafting her armor more durable than the standard-issue fare, but she's already been stationed out in Lakeland."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_002","I have her measurements, of course, but I find myself unsure of which parts of the garment will need to be reinforced, and which will need to hang a bit loose for mobility's sake. Would you be willing to demonstrate a few common stances for me?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_003","Thank you! In that case, could you begin by showing me your usual <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>battle stance<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_004","You needn't be self-conscious─just move how you usually do."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_010","Hmm... I may need to add a bit more give around the shoulders. Would you mind throwing a few punches as well? As if you were <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>boxing<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_011","This perhaps goes without saying, but you needn't actually hit anyone. I only wish to see how you move when you throw a punch."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_020","I see─the entire torso needs to be able to twist. And the knuckle portion of the gloves could likely use a bit more padding..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_021","I believe I understand what alterations to make. You've been a great help─thank you."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA006_03348_CRAFTSMAN03348_000_022","I must say that what you're wearing seems quite finely made, but if ever you do find yourself in need of new equipment, come and find me. I would be happy to offer you a reduced rate on my custom work!"
