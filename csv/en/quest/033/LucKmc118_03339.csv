50,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_THANCRED_000_020","Though I am loath to trust him, I suppose we have no choice. For now, at least."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_RYNE_000_025","Do you really think he can bring her back?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_URIANGER_000_030","Could it truly be within his power to pluck Y'shtola from the Lifestream as he claimeth? 'Tis a feat beyond even the greatest practitioners of the arcane. Yet if he would attempt it, we cannot well stand in his way."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_RUNAR_000_035","By the blessed Dark, there is yet hope!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_ALMET_000_040","I confess, I do not fully understand what is happening here─but I gather we were right to bring this man to you."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_UIMET_000_045","We found him asleep in the shade of a tree near the ruins. A fine way to behave when one's companions are in dire straits."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_CYMET_000_050","I am relieved to know he is an acquaintance of yours. Though I see you are not close. If he should displease you, we would be happy to deal with him..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_060","Now then, if I'm to fetch her for you, I will require a suitable place to work. We must find somewhere that resonates strongly with the Lifestream."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_061","And by we, I mean you. To that end, I give you this─an aetherial lamp of my own design."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_062","Keep it close as you venture out into the woods. The brighter the glow, the stronger the location's resonance with the Lifestream. Once you've found a likely spot, all you need do is whistle."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_063","You do know how to whistle, don't you, hero? Just put your lips together and blow."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_SYSTEM_000_064","To find a location that resonates with the Lifestream, you will need to search the area marked on your map."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_SYSTEM_000_065","Use your aetherial lamp to pinpoint an ideal location then call for Emet-Selch."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_070","Well, what are you standing around here for? Get searching! You <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> want to save her, don't you?"
64,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_SYSTEM_000_080","The lamplight is near blinding. Perhaps now would be a good time to call for Emet-Selch."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_SYSTEM_000_081","The lamp glows brightly."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_SYSTEM_000_082","The lamp glows warmly."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_SYSTEM_000_083","The lamp glows faintly."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_SYSTEM_000_084","The lamp is dim, as if it might go out at any moment."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_YSHTOLA_000_090","Did Emet-Selch not return with you?"
70,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_THANCRED_000_095","Though I struggle to form the words...I am glad that Emet-Selch was here."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_THANCRED_000_096","We can but pray Y'shtola never does anything so reckless again."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_RYNE_000_100","Urianger once told me that being immersed in the Lifestream can cause irreparable harm to the body. Do you suppose Y'shtola is all right?"
73,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_URIANGER_000_105","In all of history, there are but few who have returned from a misadventure in the aetherial sea possessed of mind and body both."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_URIANGER_000_106","To have done so <Emphasis>twice</Emphasis> beggareth belief. 'Tis plain Y'shtola wanteth not for favor among the Twelve."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_RUNAR_000_110","By all that is dark, Master Matoya is returned! She stands here before me yet still I cannot believe it."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_ALMET_000_115","We are both gladdened and relieved to see your companion returned hale and whole."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_UIMET_000_120","With your friend returned, you will resume your exploration of the ruins, yes? But say the word and we shall assist you."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_CYMET_000_125","It was fate who brought you to us, and fate who returned your companion to you. She yet smiles on Ronka, I am sure of it."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_130","What a touching reunion that was. It fair brought a tear to the eye. But as we both know, such tender moments are nothing if not <Emphasis>momentary</Emphasis>."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_131","Before long, they will remember their many differences, and return to squabbling."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
82,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_A1_000_001","You're wrong. They're better than that."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_A1_000_002","Says the arch Bringer of Chaos."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_132","Oh, if I had a gil for every time one of you <Emphasis>heroes</Emphasis> made that claim..."
85,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_133","Ah hah hah! Flattery will get you nowhere, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>my dear<Else/>dear boy</If>."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_134","But seriously, we Ascians do what we do for the greater good. For the Rejoining."
87,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_135","Though we may sow the seeds of chaos, it is man who tends them, he who reaps their bountiful harvest."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_136","But I grow tired of these arguments. If you would kindly refrain from retorting and return to your customary brooding silence, I will take it as thanks for rescuing your companion and leave it at that."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_137","Now, we mustn't keep your friends waiting."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_140","I told you, I tire of these inane arguments. Shouldn't you be getting ready to slay the next Lightwarden or something?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_YSHTOLA_000_150","My apologies for having put you all through such an ordeal. I could see no other way to save the Night's Blessed. Happily, both they and I yet live─thanks to you."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_YSHTOLA_000_151","But our work here is not yet done. We must make ready to enter the Qitana Ravel, and put the Lightwarden to the sword."
