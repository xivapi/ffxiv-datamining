Ghun Gun can barely contain his excitement at the prospect of yet more digging."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_01","Ghun Gun is champing at the proverbial bit at the mere thought of unearthing more artifacts discarded by the Nabaath. Following their estimated route across the desert, Jamial leads the way west towards the Nabaath Severance, where the last excavation point is situated.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_02","Ghun Gun's fervent scrabbling reveals a cylindrical container beneath the sand. He turns to offer the relic to Jamial, only to discover that your elderly companion has mysteriously disappeared."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_03","Despite being in the midst of a vast, open desert, Jamial is nowhere to be seen. Ghun Gun suggests looking from a higher vantage point while he stays behind to guard the treasure."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_04","Jamial's trail has gone cold, the desert winds having blown away any footprints he may have left. With no other recourse, you return to Ghun Gun to share these ill tidings."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_05","While you were searching for your missing companion, Ghun Gun has been inspecting the treasure he had found earlier, which contained a Nabaath royal family tree. One name in particular stands out among the list of monarchs: Jamial. Ghun Gun, never one to let logic cloud his judgment, jumps to the conclusion that the elderly man with whom you have been traveling must therefore be a ghost of a dead malik, who, satisfied by the discovery of the lost relics, has now passed on to the afterlife, hence his sudden disappearance. Believing that ghosts are plaguing Amh Araeng, he asks that you go with him and report the matter to his father."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_06","In the midst of explaining your findings to Ghen Gen, you are interrupted by the arrival of Jamial, who is in fact not a ghost after all, much to the surprise of Ghun Gun. The elderly archaeologist reveals that he was named after his grandfather, Jamial IX, the last malik of the Nabaath, and that he wishes to recover their treasures. Ghun Gun is also eager to learn more of his own people's past, and expresses his desire to assist Jamial in further expeditions. As the pair leave to discuss their next outing, Ghen Gen thanks you in their stead for your contributions towards discovering the lost history of Amh Araeng."

50,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_011","West from here, close to the Nabaath Severance."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_012","Then what are we waiting for? Must hurry, must hurry!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_020","Yes, this is the spot. Let us see what we can find here."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_021","Mmm... This dirt smells like it is hiding treasures! Time to work, work, work!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_030","Nothing yet, but every handful of dirt I sift brings me closer to the shinies!"

56,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_032","Yes, I am listening. Working, but listening."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_033","Why do you go to such lengths to help me? You have had barely a moment's rest since we first began, yet you set about your digging like a man possessed."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_034","What can I say? I love to work, that is all. Hmm... Maybe that is not such a good answer..."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_035","I mean, I am a Mord of Mord Souq! This is our way."

63,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_039","Now I see why the Nabaath valued your ancestors' friendship so highly."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_040","Oh! I have found something!"

67,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_050","But I wanted to show him the treasure! Of all the times to go for a stroll..."

71,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_080","So, what happened to him?"
72,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_081","You do not know!? Oh... This bodes ill. Ill indeed!"
73,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_082","While you were gone, I inspected the treasure."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_083","Inside was a scroll which shows the Nabaath royal family tree. And the last malik's name was..."
75,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_084","...Jamial!"
76,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_085","Which can only mean one thing─ That he is really the last malik's ghost!"
77,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_086","He must have needed someone to find his final treasure so that he could pass into the afterlife!"

88,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_107","I beg your pardon? I may be rather long in the tooth, but I am still very much alive, I assure you!"
89,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_108","So you came to the conclusion that I was a ghost of the last malik, on the basis that we have the same name? Perhaps we had best put this misunderstanding down to an overactive imagination..."
90,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_100_109","Jamial IX, the last malik, was my grandfather. I was named after him, which makes me Jamial X."
91,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_109","So you are Nabaath royalty!? It all makes sense now... I think. But why did you disappear like that?"
92,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_110","I tried to tell you that I was going to return to Mord Souq to prepare your reward, though it seems that you did not hear me. All of that scrabbling around in the dirt must have drowned out my voice..."
93,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_111","Oh. Sorry about that. I will listen harder from now on!"
94,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_112","In any case, I am incredibly grateful to both of you. I have learned much of my people and their exodus from the Flood."
95,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_113","But there must be many, many more shinies for us to find!"
96,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_114","And that is not all... I want to know more about the history of the Mord and their friendship with the Nabaath! It is my duty as future leader of Mord Souq!"
97,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_115","We cannot leave the treasures buried under the desert, or let the stories of our ancestors be forgotten!"
98,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_116","Let us work together to unearth the past!"
99,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_117","Master Ghen Gen, you have raised a fine son."
100,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHENGEN_000_118","And he will be a great leader one day, if he can avoid working himself into an early grave!"
101,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_119","Ghun Gun, there are many relics waiting to be discovered, but there is no need to rush. They will not crumble away to nothing while you are resting! Come, we have much to discuss."
102,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHENGEN_000_120","Oh, Ghun Gun, where are your manners!? <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I am sorry. He has forgotten to express his gratitude! Please, allow me, on his behalf. Thank you!"
103,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHENGEN_000_121","But I was wondering─between all of that digging, did he find time to rest?"
