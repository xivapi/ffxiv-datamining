54,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_015","In the grove to the southwest. For a mercy, they've yet to wander any closer to Slitherbough."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_016","Then we have no need to engage. Inform the guard that no one is to set foot outside the village until they have moved on."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_017","But sir, what of Toddia's heartstone?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_018","It must be retrieved before the service."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_019","Of all the times for sin eaters to appear..."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_020","Are you just going to leave them alone?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_021","Under normal circumstances, we would not hesitate in striking the beasts down. But if they indeed have the touch, I will not risk them corrupting one of our own."

62,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_023","A few days past, Toddia, a child of the Night's Blessed, was slain by the sin eaters."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_024","We succeeded in retrieving her body, but in our haste, we failed to notice her necklace was gone."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_025","Strung to it was a pendant of jade─her heartstone. All of the Night's Blessed are given such a stone at birth. It is the most valuable possession one can own."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_026","It is custom to present the heartstone of the deceased at their funeral, as an offering to the heavens. But now..."

67,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_028","I have experience fighting sin eaters. And the Light's...corruption does not touch me like it does others."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_029","Master Matoya called you Minfilia, did she not? Are you truly <Emphasis>the</Emphasis> Minfilia? Descended from the Oracle?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_030","Even so, I dare not ask you to risk your life for the Blessed."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_031","I understand how you feel, but I can't stand by knowing that your people are in need and I can help. Please, let me do this."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_032","Very well. But if the danger proves too great, you must retreat. I could never forgive myself if we were forced to hold a second service."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_033","<gasp> I nearly forgot about Thancred. What if he returns before I do?"
73,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
74,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_A1_000_001","Don't worry. I'll come with you."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_A1_000_002","Thancred doesn't need to know."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_034","Thank you. With you at my side, I'm certain we can deal with them in no time at all."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_035","Wh-What!? Do you mean to say...you'll come with me?"
78,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_036","Thank you. Let's hurry then, before he returns."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_037","Go swiftly, and may the shadows keep you both."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_040","Do not be reckless. We would be glad to have her heartstone returned to us, but it is not worth both of your lives."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_MANOFNIGHT03326_000_045","Please, I beg of you. We must have that gem."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_050","It should be around here somewhere, I think."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_060","There! The sin eaters!"
84,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_061","I was hoping there would only be one..."
85,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_062","There's no way we can search for the stone without dealing with them first."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_A2_000_001","Let's get to it, then!"
88,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_A2_000_002","Perhaps we should split them up."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_A2_000_003","What do you propose we do?"
90,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_063","What? Shouldn't we make a plan first?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_064","Though...there are only two."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_065","I'll draw one of them away. You can deal with the other."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_066","Good idea. I'll draw one away while you handle the other."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_067","Fighting them together here would make a lot of noise, which might attract beasts or other eaters..."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_068","But if we fought them separately and quietly, we might not have to worry about that."
96,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_069","All right, then. I'll draw one away while you handle the other."
97,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_080","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. <pant> <pant> There you are."
98,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_081","It's done. Though, I fear I was a bit careless. I'll do better next time, I promise."
99,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_082","I... I'm fine. You needn't worry about me. More importantly, we have to find that heartstone."
100,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_083","They said it was made of jade, right? I'll search over there in the brush."
101,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_090","It must be here somewhere."
102,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_SYSTEM_000_100","There seems to be no trace of the heartstone here."
103,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_SYSTEM_000_101","You brush away the leaves and uncover a brilliant green gem."
104,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_110","Did you have any luck?"
105,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_111","It's beautiful! This has to be it."
106,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_112","...You know, Thancred always said you were a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of many talents, and I think I'm beginning to understand what he meant."
107,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_113","I have much to learn if I'm to be even half the hero you are."
108,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_114","The hero she was..."
109,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_115","Ah, I'm sorry. Forget I said anything."
110,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_116","We should hurry back to Slitherbough. Runar and the others are probably worried."
111,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RYNE_000_120","Thancred, I can explain."
112,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_THANCRED_000_125","Well? Out with it, then."
113,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_130","Thank goodness you are safe. I had begun to fear the worst."
114,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_131","By all that is dark, you found it!"
115,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_132","We can proceed with her service as planned."
116,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_133","These blessed gems serve not only to protect us in life, but to guide our spirits unto the sunless sea in the hereafter."
117,"TEXT_LUCKMC106_03327_RUNAR_000_134","Even should we be felled by the sin eaters, so long as these gems are recovered, our souls are ensured peace in the dark. "
