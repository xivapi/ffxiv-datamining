1,"TEXT_SUBSEA110_00407_SEQ_01","With the recent increase in deliveries being sent between the Moraby Drydocks and Limsa Lominsa, passage across Oschon's Embrace has slowed to a crawl. Find Wyrstmaga, the guard whose duty it is to ensure smooth travel across the bridge."
2,"TEXT_SUBSEA110_00407_SEQ_02","Wyrstmaga appears intimidated by the angry shouts of the drivers as they fume at the seemingly interminable delays. Do your best to /soothe the irate coachmen so that the harried guard might return to his post and perform his duties in relative peace."
