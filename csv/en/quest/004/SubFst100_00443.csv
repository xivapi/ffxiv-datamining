1,"TEXT_SUBFST100_00443_SEQ_01","Convince Nyell to allow you to undertake further levequests by completing a trial leve. Though the decidedly risk-averse levemete portrays the test as a means for him to measure the likelihood of your death, you may choose instead to consider it an assessment of your skills as an adventurer."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST100_00443_SEQ_02","You have successfully completed the trial leve. Return to Quarrymill and report to Nyell."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST100_00443_SEQ_03","Having been forced to concede that you seem capable of completing such tasks as he might allocate, Nyell bemusedly accepts your offer to continue risking life and limb in the service of others. Speak with the despondent levemete to undertake further levequests, and take solace in the thought that the residents of Quarrymill, at least, will be cheered by your efforts..."

50,"TEXT_SUBFST100_00443_NYELL_000_3","All in all, terribly dangerous work...or so they tell me. Should this idea appeal to you for some reason, I may add that I am required to assess each volunteer's chances of surviving said employment via the assignation of a similarly dangerous trial leve."
