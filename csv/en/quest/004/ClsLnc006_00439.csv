1,"TEXT_CLSLNC006_00439_SEQ_01","Your visit to the Lancers' Guild has taken an unexpected turn─it would seem that Foulques has attacked a party of novice lancers in the Central Shroud, meaning the trial must wait. Ywain bids you hasten to your comrades' aid, granting you full discretion to use all necessary force if it will serve to prevent further bloodshed."
2,"TEXT_CLSLNC006_00439_SEQ_02","According to the lancer you rescued, Foulques was headed in the direction of the North Shroud. Intercept him before he has the chance to do any more harm."
3,"TEXT_CLSLNC006_00439_SEQ_03","You have prevailed over the deranged Foulques. Take word of his demise to Ywain, who awaits at the Lancers' Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSLNC006_00439_SEQ_04","For the courage you displayed in defeating Foulques, Ywain declares you ready to master a devastating new technique: Lance Charge. Having learned all you can from your guildmaster, you set your sights upon challenges yet unknown. Keeping your lessons close to heart, go forth and blaze a new trail with lance in hand."
