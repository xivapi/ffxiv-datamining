1,"TEXT_MANFST006_00446_SEQ_01","At Bentbranch Meadows, you learn from Luquelot that Ixali dirigibles have been crossing the Twelveswood's borders seemingly at will. Concerned that something may be amiss with the elementals, he has committed the details of his sightings to parchment, and bids you deliver the document to Miounne."
2,"TEXT_MANFST006_00446_SEQ_02","Miounne's face turns deathly pale as she reads Luquelot's letter. It would seem trouble is brewing, and that your aid is needed once more. Prepare yourself for a mission of grave import, and then request further orders from Miounne."

The frequency, however, does not bother me near so much as <Emphasis>where</Emphasis> they choose to fly─the patch of sky directly above the Guardian Tree."
50,"TEXT_MANFST006_00446_LUQUELOT_000_3","The tree is a sacred site, or so I was given to believe when first I came to Gridania, and thus I naturally assumed that the elementals would not suffer the Ixal to profane it. Yet the birdmen have been coming and going as they please, with nary a sign of protest from the guardians of the Twelveswood."
51,"TEXT_MANFST006_00446_LUQUELOT_000_4","And it was that which set me to thinking... Ever since the appearance of the much-talked-about “suspicious individual,” many and more strange things have been occurring in the forest. Could it be that he did something to the elementals?"
