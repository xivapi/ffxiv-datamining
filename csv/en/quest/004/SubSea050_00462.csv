1,"TEXT_SUBSEA050_00462_SEQ_01","Staelwyrn, the owner of Summerford Farms, is in need of a helping hand. Leave Limsa Lominsa through the Zephyr Gate and pay a visit to the hardworking farmer."
2,"TEXT_SUBSEA050_00462_SEQ_02","Staelwyrn explains that many of his workers were once the crew of his pirate ship, a vessel lost in the destruction of the Calamity. With the former buccaneers less than eager to embrace life on the land, numerous problems are cropping up across the orchard. Seek out those who are struggling with the unruly farmhands and lend what aid you can."

51,"TEXT_SUBSEA050_00462_BADERON_000_4","I gave ye a glowin' recommendation, so make sure ye work 'ard and impress the old bastard. Ye need directions? The place ain't 'ard to find: just take the Zephyr Gate out o' the city, and follow the road northeast."

58,"TEXT_SUBSEA050_00462_STAELWYRN_000_17","And unfortunately, the botanists I called in to train 'em have been wringin' their hands in black despair. With so much work pilin' up, I need a tougher soul like you to step in and help where it's needed."
