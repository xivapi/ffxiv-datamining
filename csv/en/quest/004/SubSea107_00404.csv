Lyulf is momentarily disappointed until he recalls a comment his father once made concerning the success of his family's crops. With seeds that thrive even in the most barren soil, the farmer hopes to soon see the day when the desolate fields of Swiftperch are transformed into a golden sea of swaying wheat."

49,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_2","All that I have left of my dear old dad is his notebook. He scrawled down a fair bit of nonsense in that ratty, dog-eared tome, but as I was leafing through the pages one day, I found a passage entitled “For the Future.” It described the location where my father had buried his “earthly wealth,” in an area that was once a bustling neighborhood."
50,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_3","I was not aware our family possessed much in the way of treasures. Could the crafty rapscallion have squirreled away a bulging bag of gil or precious stones?

55,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_13","Ah! I remember now! He once told me that our family's wheat was as a stubborn weed. It was one of the few crops that could take root in the barren soils of western La Noscea!"
56,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_14","With these seeds, our lifeless fields could once again sprout golden stalks! Thank you, oh, thank you! You have truly given this settlement the chance to build a new future."
