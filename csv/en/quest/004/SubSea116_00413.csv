49,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_AHTBYRM_000_2","Ghimthota, head of the watch here at the Drydocks, believes that pirates may be plotting an attack on the <Emphasis>Victory</Emphasis>, and she requires assistance investigating a group of unsavory individuals making camp nearby. I have recommended you for the task."
50,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_AHTBYRM_000_3","Despite all Limsa Lominsa endured before, during, and following the Calamity, the fact that there are still those who would turn their backs on the city–state so that they might line their pockets with a few handfuls of coin... Just the thought of it sickens me."
51,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_GHIMTHOTA_000_10","Ah, yes. I had a feeling you would be the one Ahtbyrm sent. Since you first arrived at the Moraby Drydocks, I have had my men watch you. Oh, there's no need to get angry. I make it a point to keep an eye on all those new to the area. It is simply protocol."
52,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_GHIMTHOTA_000_11","And you'll be pleased to know that nothing...incriminating was found. You <Emphasis>appear</Emphasis> to be a model citizen. That, and the foreman seems to think somewhat highly of you...which I must admit is quite shocking. The man doesn't even trust his own mother."
53,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_GHIMTHOTA_000_12","Very well, then. I assume Ahtbyrm informed you of what your task would entail. The pirates we believe are conspiring to raid the Drydocks were last seen making camp near an ancient stone called the mark of the Spinner. I would have you approach the men, posing as a lost adventurer, and see if you cannot somehow learn of their intentions. C'nangho stationed at the rear gates can provide you with an exact location of the camp."
54,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_CNANGHO_000_20","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Ha ha! I knew it! No more sardines for C'nangho. Tonight, I shall dine on the finest salmon on the peninsula! Why? Well, I had a little wager going with some of the other guards on who Ahtbyrm would recommend for the next job. My money was on you!"
55,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_CNANGHO_000_21","Ah, the job. Yes, of course. If you follow the road past the gates to the southeast, you will eventually come to a barren cape with a single large stone half-buried in the cliff overlooking the sea. Followers of the Twelve say it's a holy place dedicated to Nymeia, the Spinner. I'd be surprised if the pirates camped up there were aware of that, though."
56,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_CORSAIR_000_30","I'm givin' ye to the count of nine to step back on that path, and carry yer 'venturin' arse back down to whatever rock it is ye crawled out from under."
57,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_CORSAIR_000_31","Ye see, I's 'ad it up to me ears with yer type, roamin' the 'ills like they was yers to roam. It's gettin' to be that a man cannae enjoy a mug o' rum wivout some shite-breath outlander runnin' up askin' which is the way to the local levemete. Seven 'ells if I know!

61,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_GHIMTHOTA_000_50","So the trespassers are indeed pirates, and they are indeed planning something. But what is this talk of getting “me boy back”?"
62,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_GHIMTHOTA_000_51","Could it be that their target never was the <Emphasis>Victory</Emphasis>?"
63,"TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_GHIMTHOTA_000_52","Something is not right, and I won't sit by idly waiting for those pirates to make the first move. I shall order increased patrols immediately. Thank you again for your help, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It appears we were wise to put our trust in you."
