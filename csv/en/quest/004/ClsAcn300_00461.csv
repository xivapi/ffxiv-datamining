1,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_01","Thubyrgeim explains that K'lyhia has already begun her grand strategy that will culminate in Doesmaga's downfall. Your first task in this daring scheme is to deliver a set of instructions to a fisherman known as Rhylzirn, who can be found in Costa del Sol, in eastern La Noscea."
2,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_02","After delivering the list to Rhylzirn, you are rewarded with a fresh herring. Your next task, according to the gruff fisherman, is to take the fish you received to the cook, Opylona."
3,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_03","Opylona, happy to receive the freshly caught herring, insists you take one of her homemade eel pies.

4,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_04","In return for the eel pie, Master Gegeruju rewards you with a heavy purse of gil.

5,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_05","For what seems a somewhat exorbitant price, you give the hefty purse to Ealdgyth in exchange for her well-worn pareo and a mysterious leather satchel. As instructed, take the pareo to Drogo, the warehouse foreman."

8,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_08","K'lyhia's clever tactics coupled with your flawless execution have led to the resounding defeat of the pirate Doesmaga. With her past firmly behind her, the foreseer is able to clearly see the reality she desired all along.

9,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_09","Hand over the odd leather satchel to Thubyrgeim."
10,"TEXT_CLSACN300_00461_SEQ_10","After hearing of your exploits and learning of K'lyhia's decision, Thubyrgeim concludes that the pairing of the arcanima-obsessed guildmaster and foreseer will lead to great advances in the art of the arcanist. Citing your involvement as the catalyst for these developments, the acting guildmaster rewards you with a new technique and encourages you to continue improving in your chosen discipline."
