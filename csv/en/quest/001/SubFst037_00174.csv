3,"TEXT_SUBFST037_00174_SEQ_03","While your actions have helped contain the Ixal menace for the time being, it will not be long before they return to threaten the people of Gridania. It seems that Guithrit and his superiors will use the brief respite you have bought them to find a more permanent solution."
