50,"TEXT_SUBFST053_00159_ARMELLE_000_3","They began appearing in this area not long after the Calamity. Now, night after night, the creatures assail every living thing they come across with showers of fiery sparks."
51,"TEXT_SUBFST053_00159_ARMELLE_000_4","They seem fond of flames, and I dare not build a fire for fear of drawing them upon me. I shudder to imagine how much worse it must be for the poor Hearers...

52,"TEXT_SUBFST053_00159_ARMELLE_000_5","But it is the marshlights' fondness for flames that may yet prove their downfall. In this pot, I have placed a smoldering coal. Use it to start a fire at Lilystone, and lure the creatures to you, putting them down as they arrive."
