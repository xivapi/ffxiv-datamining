Unfortunately, he's run out of hi-potions and cannot leave his post to obtain more from the merchant at the Bannock. Help Arold by bringing him the medication he needs."

I caught a scurry of squirrels gnawing on the fences earlier. I managed to drive them off, but not before they decided to gnaw on <Emphasis>me</Emphasis> instead! And now I'm the bloody mess you see before you."

You wouldn't happen to be carrying a spare flask?"
