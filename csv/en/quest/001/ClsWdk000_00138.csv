51,"TEXT_CLSWDK000_00138_CORGG_000_4","Wonderful! ...I should mention at this point that Timbermaster Beatin assesses all would-be apprentices personally, so you will need to obtain his approval before you begin."
52,"TEXT_CLSWDK000_00138_CORGG_000_5","Timbermaster Beatin can be a harsh and unforgiving man, but if you love the craft and have the will to learn, you could ask for no better tutor. He is, quite simply, the finest carpenter in Gridania."
