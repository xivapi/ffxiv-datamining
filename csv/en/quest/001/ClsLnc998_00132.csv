49,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_JILLIAN_000_2","It is no small thing to join our guild, and all the more welcome are they who weigh the decision with due care."
50,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_JILLIAN_000_3","Our doors are ever open should you later decide to take up the lancers' art. Till then, I wish you the best of luck."
51,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_JILLIAN_000_5","Excellent! I shall let Guildmaster Ywain know to expect you."
52,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_JILLIAN_000_6","All who seek admittance to our ranks must present themselves before him. He will judge if you are fit to become one of us."
53,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_JILLIAN_000_7","Pray make your way to the training area within. Our guildmaster awaits you there."
54,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_10","Well met, adventurer. I understand you wish to learn the lancers' art under our roof."
55,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_11","I see you have some combat experience. Yet it remains to be seen if such skills as you have acquired will avail you here."
56,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_12","But no matter. In my capacity as guildmaster, I shall guide your training, beginning with the very basics─the principles of our art."
57,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_13","There exist myriad fighting styles, each of which has its own unique qualities. None, however, can claim to be as offensively minded as ours. Our approach is ever one of attack, no matter who─or what─we face."
58,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_14","An experienced lancer is able to wield a polearm as if it were an extension of his body. He transforms into a raging storm before his foes, delivering a barrage of devastating thrusts and slashes."
59,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_15","To facilitate such a relentless assault, we lancers forgo plate, favoring armor of leather and chain─such materials as provide adequate protection without unduly hindering movement."
60,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_16","A lancer's worth may be measured quite simply─in how swiftly and decisively he can pierce his enemy's defenses."
61,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_17","By its nature, the polearm is a simple weapon to wield─for good or ill. Even in a farmer's hands, it is capable of wreaking considerable havoc. Thus has it been a mainstay of every great army since ancient times."
62,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_18","Yet know that a lance alone does not a lancer make. Faced with unfavorable odds, an unseasoned spearman will break formation and flee without a moment's hesitation."
63,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_19","A true lancer, however, flinches not before his enemies, for he knows not the meaning of fear. Ever does he press forward, disdainful of the odds, that he might pierce the enemy line and open a path to victory."
64,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_20","Needless to say, doing so requires no small amount of courage. And that is why our guild has striven from the first to instill this essential quality in every soul who passes through our halls."
65,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_100_20","Arduous trials await you should you join our ranks. Knowing this, have you the resolve to wield the lance?"
66,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_Q1_000_1","Have you the resolve to wield the lance?"
67,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_A1_000_1","Yes"
68,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_A1_000_2","No"
69,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_25","Hah hah hah! Your honesty does you credit, adventurer."
70,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_26","It takes a kind of strength to admit that something is beyond you. Should you ever muster the resolve to take up the lance, I will be here."
71,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_30","Well said, adventurer. I see no reason to deny you a place within our ranks."
72,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_31","Ah, but I neglected to introduce myself. I am Ywain, master of this guild."
73,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_32","Pleasantries duly exchanged, I shall add to your hunting log the names of the creatures against which a lancer might hone his skills."
74,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_33","In celebration of the occasion, I hereby present you with your very own spear. Arm yourself with it, and speak to me once more."
75,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_YWAIN_000_34","I would have you undertake your first task─a trial, to be precise."
76,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_SYSTEM_000_40","You have unlocked a new class! You can change to this class at any time by equipping the weapon received from this quest."
77,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_SYSTEM_000_41","When changing classes, <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>gear sets<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> will allow you to register and save your equipment. You may then use them to switch between classes instantly without the need to manually equip weapons or equipment."
78,"TEXT_CLSLNC998_00132_SYSTEM_000_42","A button for the Gear Set interface is located in the upper portion of the <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Character<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> window."
