Have you come to observe our artisans at work?"
49,"TEXT_CLSGLD001_00187_JEMIME_000_2","Indeed, it is a marvel to watch goldsmiths transform raw metals and uncut gemstones into sparkling rings, earrings, and necklaces─some of which possess magical properties, no less!"
50,"TEXT_CLSGLD001_00187_JEMIME_000_3","You know, if you'd like to try your hand at goldsmithing, the guild is open to adventurers like yourself. No prior experience is required, for we teach all you need to know about the craft. Would you be interested?"

56,"TEXT_CLSGLD001_00187_JEMIME_000_22","That is to say, you are yet lacking in worldly experience. But I do not doubt that it won't be long before you are ready to take up the chaser hammer."
57,"TEXT_CLSGLD001_00187_SYSTEM_000_23","Before you can take up another discipline, you must first complete the level 10 quest of your starting class."
