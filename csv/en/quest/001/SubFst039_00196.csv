49,"TEXT_SUBFST039_00196_GALFRID_000_2","Allow me to explain. The nearby river is home to a colony of black efts whom I sent a party of recruits to slay. Yet scarcely a bell after I had done so, the youngsters returned─hysterical yet noticeably unbloodied─and loudly bemoaned their misfortune at ever having been sent to contend with such “hells-born horrors.”"
50,"TEXT_SUBFST039_00196_GALFRID_000_3","Pitiful. My great-grandmama could dispatch an eft with her walking stick and a harsh word. That such a task should cow a whole party of able-bodied men and women is beyond belief. I would have you show these quivering milksops how it's done: make your way to the river and put down four of the creatures."
