Though a cure is now available, Gridanian researchers periodically check the chigoes for signs of the disease in order to prevent further outbreaks."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST034_00128_GALFRID_000_2","The task is simple: put down as many of the local chigoe population as necessary to acquire eight of their egg sacs."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST034_00128_GALFRID_000_3","Having done so, you are to deliver them to Monranguin at Gilbert's Spire. He will answer any queries you might have. Now, I have other business to attend to."

54,"TEXT_SUBFST034_00128_MONRANGUIN_000_13","The chigoe, you see, is one of the few creatures capable of transmitting the disease known as the Creeping Death. Until relatively recently, any Hyur who contracted this ghastly illness would almost invariably perish."
55,"TEXT_SUBFST034_00128_MONRANGUIN_000_14","Indeed, a single outbreak once claimed the lives of a third of the Hyuran population here in Gridania. That was a long time ago, of course. With the medicines available to us now, the Creeping Death is not the killer it once was."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST034_00128_MONRANGUIN_000_15","Even so, it is best to halt any new outbreaks before they occur. Thus we gather chigoe eggs on a regular basis in order to assist the Trappers' League with their ongoing research. Your timely assistance is most appreciated."
