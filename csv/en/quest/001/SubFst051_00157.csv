Having been brought up around the birds, the Elezen possesses a wealth of knowledge on chocobos that serves him well at the ranch. He is, however, frequently surprised by the vagaries of Gridanian life."

51,"TEXT_SUBFST051_00157_LUQUELOT_000_4","You should be able to obtain the web from the diremites themselves. There are usually a few to be found roaming the lands around the ranch. Six strands should be sufficient."

57,"TEXT_SUBFST051_00157_LUQUELOT_000_15","I left my homeland to accept employment here at the ranch, instructing others in the methods of chocobo husbandry. Yet I have found that it is often I who am the recipient of others' instruction─and on a great many matters! Truly, one can never know what life may hold in store."
