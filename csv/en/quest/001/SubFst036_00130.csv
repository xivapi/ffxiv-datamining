1,"TEXT_SUBFST036_00130_SEQ_01","Gabineaux is beside himself with rage as he expounds on the evils of the microchus. Slay eight of the nutrient-sapping pests and bring relief to both the land and to Gabineaux's troubled mind."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST036_00130_SEQ_02","You have slain eight microchus. Report to Ealdfrith outside Gabineaux's Bower."
