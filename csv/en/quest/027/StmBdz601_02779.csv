50,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_SOROCAN_000_002","Please, see that it reaches him quickly. You should be able to find him to the south of here, tending to a flock of sheep."

54,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_KHAIDAI_000_012","You see, desertmaker beetles run rampant in this area. This bag contains a few vials of acid, which softens their tough carapace and renders them defenseless."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_KHAIDAI_000_013","The creatures are incredibly tenacious and are difficult to take down without the help of this mixture. Earlier, I attempted to drive one off on my own and was injured."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_KHAIDAI_000_014","While I remain here to recover, would you go and clear the surrounding area of these beetles for me?"
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_KHAIDAI_000_015","Here, take these vials. Empty their contents upon any desertmaker beetle that comes at you. It will make them that much easier to kill."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_KHAIDAI_000_016","Please see that the neighboring areas are cleared of any stray desertmaker beetles. In the meantime, I shall remain here and gather my strength."

61,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_KHAIDAI_000_022","B-But don't you ever tell her that I said that! As an Oroniri man, it is my duty to protect her, not the other way around."
62,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_KHAIDAI_000_023","Now then, if you want your reward, you best return to my wife. She will see that you are fairly compensated for your services."

65,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_SOROCAN_000_031","<sigh> Then again, I suppose I cannot complain. While Khaidai may not have the eye for detail that I do, he is an incredibly kind man and does what he can to take care of both me and our sheep."
66,"TEXT_STMBDZ601_02779_SOROCAN_000_032","Ah─but forgive me. You have not come all this way to hear me talk about my husband! Please, take this and feel free to be on your way!"
