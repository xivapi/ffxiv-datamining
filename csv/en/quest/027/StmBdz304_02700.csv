49,"TEXT_STMBDZ304_02700_KAGERO_000_001","Long ago, in exchange for the treasures we gave them, the Kojin taught our ancestors the secret to living in this great expanse of water."

54,"TEXT_STMBDZ304_02700_KAGERO_000_011","The Kojin will be absolutely delighted to hear it! You see, they primarily use striped rays for transportation and to deliver goods. The beasts, however, are so terrified of the bubbles that stream from these plants that upon seeing them, they will buck off whoever─or whatever─they are carrying."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ304_02700_KAGERO_000_012","I shall inform them of all that you have done for them later. For now, please allow me to present you with your reward. See, aren't you happy you helped?"
