1,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_01","The Ruby Princess would like to look into the origins of a peculiar faerie tale regarding a seafaring fisherman and a princess who had been plunged into a years-long slumber. She believes the island of Onokoro holds some of the answers she seeks."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_02","You seek out the princess, who has been approached by one of the natives of the island─a Confederate pirate. While he starts to get a bit smart with you, it does not take long for him to recognize exactly who you are. Brushing it off as a joke, he then urges you to speak with a fisherman who comes to visit the island once a year. According to the pirate this man knows a great deal about faerie tales, and is currently docked at the Quickscape Pier."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_03","As the fisherman tells it: long ago a Kojin of the Blue was saved from certain death by a Hyuran fisherman. The grateful Kojin rewarded this man with the promise of an adventure and a vial of liquid that would allow him to breathe indefinitely underwater. Following him to the depths of the seas, the fisherman and Kojin traveled together, eventually coming across a princess who had been asleep for years in her palace. The Kojin, seeing this, produced another vial that instantly woke the princess. Hearing this story, Kurenai concludes the palace mentioned in the faerie tale is Shisui of the Violet Tides and would like to return to Sui–no–Sato to conduct further investigations."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_04","Kurenai and you are joined by Shiosai, the overseer. After informing him of all that you have learned from your trip to the surface, he reveals that one of the ancient stories of Sui–no–Sato spoke of a Ruby Princess who wed a Hyuran man. Suspecting that the fisherman's faerie tale is closer to an account of historical events, Kurenai would like to travel with you to Tamamizu to ask the Kojin of the Blue about the elixir for eternal sleep."

52,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_KURENAI_000_032","During one such visit, I was given a tome filled with faerie tales. It was old, worn, and─from what I am given to understand─written in Kugane."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_KURENAI_000_033","In it was a story about a fisherman who sailed the Ruby Sea. While traveling, he came across a princess who had fallen into a years-long slumber. She was eventually awakened upon taking an elixir of some sort. "
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_KURENAI_000_034","What intrigues me, however, is the fact that many of the places this fisherman visited exist in the real world. It makes me wonder if, perhaps, this story is rooted in reality."

84,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_FISHERMAN02705_000_153","I recall now... Once upon a time, there was a fisherman on the island of Onokoro who saved a Kojin of the Blue from the maws of a terrible beast."
85,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_FISHERMAN02705_000_154","As thanks, the Kojin offered him a vial of liquid. When taken, it would allow the fisherman to plunge into the far depths of the ocean without drowning. It was there that their journey together began."
86,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_FISHERMAN02705_000_155","They visited temples, palaces, and villages under the sea. They met all manner of men, women, and creatures...including a beautiful princess, who had fallen into a deep, deep slumber. According to her people, she had been like that for years."

97,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_KURENAI_000_212","Shiosai shall be joining us shortly. Most stories in Sui–no–Sato are passed down orally. He should be able to tell us if any of our own stories match the tale the fisherman recounted for us."
