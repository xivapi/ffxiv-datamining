0,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_SEQ_00","Khulan is worried about her friend."
1,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_SEQ_01","Khulan explains to you that the Dotharl khatun is in charge of identifying who newborns were in their past lives. However, even the khatun is not infallible, and Khulan is convinced she incorrectly identified Mauci as the reincarnation of Mauci of the Seven and Seven Swords. Mauci is frustrated by the continuing speculation regarding his identity and asks you accompany him to an area just outside Dotharl Khaa."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_SEQ_02","Mauci explains there is a hill to the north of the village that he likes to sit upon when he needs to reorganize his thoughts. As he is unarmed, you agree to make the trip with him and keep him safe from harm."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_SEQ_03","You resolve to ensure that Mauci reaches his destination safe and sound, and to there lend the Dotharl boy an ear.

※You must be accompanied by Mauci to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_SEQ_04","Mauci remarks that while he is grateful for Khulan's attention, he cannot help but be jealous of his friend and how comparatively simple her life has been. The village's expectations of Mauci have clearly taken their toll on the young Dotharl. He states that he no longer cares if he is able to wield a sword, he just desires the strength required to feel he belongs to his tribe."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_SEQ_05","As you prepare to return to Dotharl Khaa, you are set upon by a manzasiri. The beast is downed in the blink of an eye by none other than Mauci himself. The young Dotharl is not quite sure how he did it, but it seems he defeated the manzasiri with his bare fists."
6,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_SEQ_06","Mauci has started to think he may be a much better fighter with his fists than he ever will be with a sword. He mentions that he would like to confirm something and bids you head back to Dotharl Khaa to tell Khulan of his newfound strength. Khulan is initially shocked to see you returned without Mauci, but calms down when she hears of recent developments. Now that it is clear Mauci is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, Khulan is positive that her friend is not who the khatun judged him to be. She asks you to continue to lend her your help, that you might discover the truth behind Mauci's identity."

50,"TEXT_STMBDZ615_02793_KHULAN_000_002","Yet, despite his lack of ability, Mauci himself refuses to give up. He blames himself when it is not his fault."
