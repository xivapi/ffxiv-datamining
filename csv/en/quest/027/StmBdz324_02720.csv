1,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_01","Nayoshi decides that in order to improve his skills as a fisherman he must begin training and begs you to accompany him. He is afraid that, should his misfortune persist, he will need a strong <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> on hand to dispatch of whatever monstrosity he mistakenly drags in from the open waters."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_02","You quickly put an end to the beast Nayoshi has caught. Go over and reassure the still-trembling fisherman that he no longer has anything to fear."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_03","Upon seeing you and the slain monster, Nayoshi regains his composure and thanks you for your help. Despite the less-than-stellar results of his first attempt, he is ready to try again. He believes a change of scenery might help to spur his attempts along and asks that you meet him at the southern coast."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_04","As soon as you join him, Nayoshi pulls out his rod and throws out a line. A few moments later, he reels in another sea beast. Quickly dispatch of it and speak with the young fisherman."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_05","Nayoshi appears defeated by his lack of progress and asks you for advice on how he might improve his fishing. After a bit of back and forth, the two of you come to the conclusion that he must receive advice from some of the other fishermen. As the village's least productive member, however, he is certain his pleas for help will fall on deaf ears. He requests that you, the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who delivered Isari from disaster be the one to go around and ask for fishing advice for him."
6,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_06","You begin by approaching the village's most experienced fisherman─the man who requested that you save Nayoshi from the shiranui. He reveals to you that the best way to catch fish is to observe their behavior and use it to your advantage. The example he gives you of torch fishing, however, can only be employed under a very specific set of circumstances and Nayoshi asks that you ask one of the other nearby fishermen for more practical advice."
7,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_07","You speak with one of the younger fishermen whose aptitude for fishing has lately gained him village-wide recognition. Upon learning who you are, he is happy to share with you the secret to his remarkable success. He presents you with a wooden fishing lure and tells you that this is the easiest way to attract and catch fish. Saying you can keep it, he wishes you good luck in your fishing endeavors. Nayoshi would like to look at the lure the young fisherman has given you and requests that you meet him behind the large boulders."
8,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_SEQ_08","You deliver the lure to Nayoshi, who has been cornered by Koruri. She has come to impart some advice about fishing to Nayoshi. Telling him that he must learn to clear his mind at sea, she suggests he try concentrating solely upon the waves and feeling the rod in his hand. With all the knowledge he has gained, will Nayoshi finally find a way to overcome his troubles?"

66,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_NAYOSHI_000_035","Isari is a small, unpretentious village, where your reputation hinges sorely on your ability to fish. Those who show no aptitude for it are often scorned. Even if I were to appeal to them for help, I would simply be ignored."

73,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_VETERANFISHER_000_042","Well, the most important thing is to understand the fish you want to catch. For example, long ago we used to row boats out to sea at night and light a torch. It would draw schools of silvertails to us, allowing fishermen to haul them back by the boatload."
74,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_NAYOSHI_000_043","Torches? But none of us here could ever afford the amount of oil it would require to keep them burning..."
75,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_VETERANFISHER_000_044","Exactly. That, Nayoshi, is part of the reason we remain a destitute village. Life would be far easier had we the means to put torch fishing into practice again."

82,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_FACILITYFISHER_000_052","Ah, indeed! My sincerest apologies. Of course I would be delighted to share with you my technique. After all, someone must make up for Nayoshi's inability to teach you about our craft."
83,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_FACILITYFISHER_000_053","Until recently, I was only slightly better than your average fisherman. I tried everything to improve─from using nets to even pots and fake bait to improve my performance."

91,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_NAYOSHI_000_063","Never! As a man of Isari, I must do whatever it takes to learn to fish! How else am I to survive? ...Besides, weren't you the one who was pushing me to improve my fishing abilities? "
92,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_KORURI_000_064","If it is simply survival you are worried about, there are plenty of other options. You could gather seaweed, for example. Then again, there is a good chance you would be equally bad at that..."
93,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_NAYOSHI_000_065","Koruri, if you have simply come to poke fun at me, please leave."
94,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_KORURI_000_066","...I actually came here to give you some advice. When you are fishing, you must shut down all your thoughts and concentrate solely upon seeing─nay, <Emphasis>feeling</Emphasis>─the great expanse of water that stretches out before you. Do it right, and the seas will guide you."
95,"TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_KORURI_000_067","By contrast, should you allow your mind to roam aimlessly, so will your rod. The waters will only amplify the chaos in your heart and the fish will avoid your line."
