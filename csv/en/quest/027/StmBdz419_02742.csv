50,"TEXT_STMBDZ419_02742_GYOEN_000_002","There was a kind and good-hearted artisan who crafted these bells. He would make a gift of one to every newborn Namazu on its nameday."

57,"TEXT_STMBDZ419_02742_SENTEI_000_012","Yet know they will not ring as they are. You need place within them round pebbles from the rocky lands just behind us. Then they will ring as true as they did in my grandfather's day."

62,"TEXT_STMBDZ419_02742_GYOEN_000_022","A looong time ago, longer now than it seems, Yanxia was a war-torn land. Much strife, much battle. Even we Namazu were recruited to render aid, running messages to and fro. Amidst the conflict, one very special Namazu was approached by a great general. The general asked the Namazu to swim across the One River and deliver for him a letter of great import."
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ419_02742_GYOEN_000_023","The Namazu took to the water and swam his heart out. Arrows flew across the skies and fell into the river mere ilms from his barbels. Yet somehow he managed to elude death and arrive at the opposite shore. And the letter he delivered proved the key to victory for the general and his allies on the other side. With that, Yanxia was united and the nation of Doma was founded!"
64,"TEXT_STMBDZ419_02742_GYOEN_000_024","That general was the great Ganen, the first king of Doma. But even from the throne, he did not forget his Namazu friends. To show his gratitude for our help in winning the war, he gifted our kind with a bell and named us his royal messengers. And that marked the first time any Namazu rose to such heights."
65,"TEXT_STMBDZ419_02742_GYOEN_000_025","That is why to this day we Namazu wear our bells with great pride and honor. See? So it is true, what I told you before. We Namazu here are quite civilized indeed."
