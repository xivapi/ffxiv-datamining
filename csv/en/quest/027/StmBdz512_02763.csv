1,"TEXT_STMBDZ512_02763_SEQ_01","Cotota returns the animal fat to you and bids you go and speak with the khan, Iturgen. You elect to present the fat to him and explain your current situation."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ512_02763_SEQ_02","After you have finished explaining everything to Iturgen, he bids you head to the northeast. You are unsure as to why he would have you travel in said direction, but it seems he is quite keen that you do. Upon finding what seems to be the area he wished for you to visit, you decide to wait and see if anyone, or anything, else appears."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ512_02763_SEQ_03","After waiting a short time you see Gascot meeting a group of Gesi that includes Jebei. They demand that Gascot furnish them with bombs which they plan to use to destroy Reunion. When Gascot declares he has no intention of supplying them with any weapons, the atmosphere turns sour and the Gesi move to attack the merchant."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ512_02763_SEQ_04","You intervene in the nick of time, just barely saving Gascot from the Gesi assault. After you have dealt with the attackers, you go to see if your merchant friend is unharmed."

6,"TEXT_STMBDZ512_02763_SEQ_06","When you eventually locate Gascot, he remarks that he has just finished saying his good-byes to the Au Ra that were so transfixed by his Bomb Dance. You hand him the vellum given to you by Cotota which Gascot immediately recognizes as a sign that he has been granted permission to trade in Reunion. Filled with enthusiasm anew, Gascot declares he will return to his office in Kugane and bring back with him wares that will enrich the marketplace. He bids you farewell and says he looks forward to the day when the two of you are reunited once more in Reunion."
