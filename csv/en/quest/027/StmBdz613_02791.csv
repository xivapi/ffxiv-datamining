1,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_SEQ_01","A young Dotharl named Mauci approaches you regarding his past. Despite being constantly told he is Mauci of the Seven and Seven Swords reincarnate, he cannot shake the feeling that he has no connection to the master swordsman. You agree to help him by asking the residents of Dotharl Khaa if Mauci is truly who everyone says he is."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_SEQ_02","You question a few of the locals and are told time and time again that Mauci most certainly is the reincarnation of his namesake. No other Dotharl were born the year the previous Mauci passed, and his poor swordsmanship is not enough to convince anyone that they could be wrong."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_SEQ_03","Mauci still seems unconvinced that he has been accurately named, but resolves to continue his sword training regardless. You agree to lend him your aid in the hope that it will lead to him improving as a swordsman."

50,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_MAUCI_000_002","They say he was so fast with a sword it was as if he wielded seven blades. Indeed, he was well respected."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_MAUCI_000_003","However, I struggle to believe I am he. No matter how much I practice, my swordsmanship improves not."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_MAUCI_000_004","I would like you to ask around the village. Find out if I truly am who they say. If there is a secret concerning my previous life, they will not tell me, no matter how much I ask."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_MERGEN_000_010","What are you saying? Of course his name is correct! He may be clumsy with a blade at the moment, but he will improve in time."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_MERGEN_000_011","I hear that the previous Mauci also struggled when he first picked up a sword. All he needs do is train."

56,"TEXT_STMBDZ613_02791_KISHILIGH_000_013","The previous Mauci of the Seven and Seven Swords was a true warrior. His swordsmanship was unmatched. I cannot believe he would not be reincarnated."
