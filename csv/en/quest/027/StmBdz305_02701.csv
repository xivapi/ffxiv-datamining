50,"TEXT_STMBDZ305_02701_AOGAMI_000_002","The day you rescued me, I had left to do just that, but before I could harvest the mozuku I so dearly need, I was ambushed by those awful creatures."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ305_02701_AOGAMI_000_003","I still have yet to recover from the injuries I sustained and was hoping you could help me one last time. Please, might you gather four clumps of mozuku and bring them back to me?"

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ305_02701_AOGAMI_000_012","Until now, I had never been stung while gathering mozuku. <sigh> I suppose I only have myself to blame. I should not have allowed myself to be distracted by the glittering scales of the fish that swam by."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ305_02701_AOGAMI_000_013","If only we had fields like those upon the surface, we could mitigate such risks. Sadly we are a small village, and space for farming is something we can scarce afford."
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ305_02701_AOGAMI_000_014","While the sea is bountiful and full of riches, unlike you, she only bestows her blessings upon those who hold her in awe. It was arrogant of me to forget to fear her mighty waves."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ305_02701_AOGAMI_000_015","I, however, remain thankful for the ordeal because it reminded me of something very important and allowed me to make a wonderful new friend. Please take this gift."
