49,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_1","Oh. Are you quite certain? I felt sure that you were destined to make the next big find... I pictured you grinning next to a lump of gold the size of your head."
50,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_2","'Tis truly a shame, but if you still have your doubts, there is no help for it. Should you be struck by a sudden desire to amass untold wealth, I shall be here to help."
51,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_3","Music to my ears! Aye, the kind made when one's pickaxe strikes gold!"
52,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_4","You must introduce yourself to Guildmaster Adalberta right away."
53,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_5","Her approval is required if you are to be formally admitted to our ranks."
54,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_6","In case you're unaware, Adalberta is perhaps the most accomplished of those miners who still swing a pickaxe."
55,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_7","Her understanding of our trade is unsurpassed, and her flair for prospecting uncanny. Her brain, in short, is a veritable <Emphasis>gold mine</Emphasis> of knowledge─much of it concerning the mining of gold.
...Ha ha! Jesting apart, you stand to learn a great deal from her."
56,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_LINETTE_000_8","When you are ready, pray present yourself to Adalberta. You will find her down the steps yonder, over by the bar."
57,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_10","Well met, adventurer. Adalberta's my name, and I'm the master of this guild."
58,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_11","I take it you wish to become a miner. Well, our doors are open to all who aren't afraid to work hard and get dirty."
59,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_12","Thanks to recent advances in refining techniques, it's now possible to smelt even low-purity ores. I mention this because it's allowed us to reopen a number of mines which were long thought exhausted, prompting trade to flourish."
60,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_13","Truth be told, with business as it is at the moment, we can't take on enough new miners. And few folk make better miners than adventurers, you being a hardy lot."
61,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_14","What's more, you're well traveled, which serves to expand the guild's sphere of activity. Oh, but I'm not suggesting you join solely for <Emphasis>our</Emphasis> benefit."
62,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_15","For your part, you'll acquire skills that will prove to your profit─a mutually beneficial arrangement, I trust you'll agree. So what say you? You will join us, yes?"
63,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_Q1_000_1","Ready to work hard and get dirty?"
64,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_A1_000_1","Yes"

66,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_16","This is...unexpected. You have so much to gain and nothing to lose. Won't you reconsider?"
67,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_17","Then I bid you welcome to the Miners' Guild! May your toils never go unrewarded!"
68,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_18","Now then, here's a pickaxe to get you started. It's not the newest, but it should serve a novice well enough."
69,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_19","Go on and take it up─see how it feels in your hands."
70,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_ADALBERTA_000_20","Speak to me again when you're ready, and I'll assign you a little task to help you get into the swing of things."
71,"TEXT_CLSMIN011_00597_SYSTEM_000_30","You have unlocked a new class! You can change to this class at any time by equipping the tool received from this quest."
