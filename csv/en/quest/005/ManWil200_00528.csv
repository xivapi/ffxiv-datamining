203,"TEXT_MANWIL200_00528_KANESENNA_000_185","For the greater part of its history, Garlemald was not even among the most influential nations in Ilsabard, the northern continent. However, its innovations in the field of magitek, some fifty years past, helped to raise it from the depths of obscurity."
204,"TEXT_MANWIL200_00528_KANESENNA_000_186","Emboldened by this technology, it set about subjugating its neighbors, swiftly absorbing each into its ever-expanding territory. And when all of Ilsabard lay within its grasp, it turned its ravenous gaze upon Eorzea."
205,"TEXT_MANWIL200_00528_KANESENNA_000_187","Yet Garlemald's transformation did not come about by virtue of magitek alone. Its success owed much to the consummate leadership of its first and reigning emperor."

208,"TEXT_MANWIL200_00528_KANESENNA_000_190","Yet we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent, for Garlemald still maintains a presence in Eorzea, in the form of the XIVth Imperial Legion."
