1,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_SEQ_01","After expressing his gratitude, Jalzahn informs you he will return to his native Radz–at–Han ere long. However, he has one last favor to ask of you: deliver a bottle of Sunshine─an incomparable liquor distilled in the alchemist's very own cellarage─to Gerolt as a gift."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_SEQ_02","Though he would have preferred to receive the liquor from Jalzahn in person, Gerolt unsurprisingly accepts the present. Much to your surprise, however, the smith reveals that there is yet work to be done─awakening sentience itself within your Zodiac Weapon. Indeed, it would seem the arms of legend consciously bonded with the soul of their bearers. Upon overhearing this, Jalzahn pledges to postpone his homewards journey. He posits that certain varieties of crystal can transfer a sense─a fragment of consciousness─via soul resonance, and thereby awaken the sentience slumbering within your weapon. To obtain these crystals, Gerolt tasks you with obtaining an introduction to Remon, a man of the black market, from Rowena in Revenant's Toll. Go now and speak with her."
3,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_SEQ_03","According to Rowena, Remon holds an old grudge against Gerolt─the result of an unpaid loan─and will not deal with any friend of the blacksmith without an apology from the man himself. Return to Hyrstmill and inform Gerolt of this, and that Remon resides in his “usual haunt.”"
4,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_SEQ_04","According to Gerolt, Remon's bitterness stems not from the loan unpaid, but rather from a love unrequited─though he will say no more on the subject. Jalzahn urges Gerolt to make his amends with a gift: the bottle of Sunshine. Once you, too, have added your voice to the proceedings, Gerolt reluctantly gives up his prized liquor. Take the bottle of Sunshine and seek out Remon in Swiftperch."
5,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_SEQ_05","Remon, a fellow with many, many connections, has anticipated your coming. He accepts Gerolt's apology, and offers to trade you mahatma in exchange for aught that will profit Rowena. Speak to him again when you wish to begin your dealings."

72,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_JALZAHN_000_045","Indeed, indeed... Mayhap we can awaken the soul within the arm via some substance alike in character. Creating a resonance betwixt souls can allow for the transference of certain qualities, after all."
73,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_JALZAHN_000_046","Atma, for instance, has no sentience of its own to speak of. Yet as the crystallized soul of a living being, it can contain a particular sense─an aspect of consciousness, if you will."

75,"TEXT_JOBREL016_00560_JALZAHN_000_048","Of course, for the weapon to profit by this, simply possessing the crystal will not be enough. The sense will not magically transfer itself. We will have to find a way to make the soul without connect to the soul within."
