1,"TEXT_CLSWDK010_00539_SEQ_01","Beatin has been inconsolable since the discovery of Gairhard's broken bow. Believing his dear friend to be deceased, he asks that you give him time to be alone. Speak with Nicoliaux and see if he has any ideas as to how you can comfort the timbermaster."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK010_00539_SEQ_02","Nicoliaux tells you of how the timbermaster flew into a terrible rage upon receiving word of Gairhard's presumed death, breaking anything within reach with his bare hands. Although Nicoliaux believes the situation to be hopeless, he suggests that you present a length of high-quality rosewood lumber to Beatin, in an effort to distract the timbermaster with work."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK010_00539_SEQ_03","Your attempt to distract Beatin unexpectedly triggers the revelation that Gairhard and his squad must still be alive. However, the timbermaster fears that his friend is in dire need of assistance. Unable to grip a saw due to the injuries he incurred while rampaging through the workshop, he asks you to craft a quality crab bow and meld to it a grade three savage aim materia. Once you have prepared the bow, track down Gairhard in the North Shroud and see that he receives the help he needs."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK010_00539_SEQ_04","You fortuitously stumble upon Gairhard's squad, which is locked in battle with the Ixal. Amazed by the inexplicable appearance of a carpenter in the middle of a battlefield, he is shocked to receive the crab bow. After sparing the briefest of thanks, he turns his attention to the Ixal and promptly slays their leader with a single arrow. Their forces in disarray, the Ixal are forced to retreat. Return to Gridania and inform Beatin of all that has transpired."
5,"TEXT_CLSWDK010_00539_SEQ_05","Beatin thanks you profusely for saving Gairhard's life, and states that he owes you a debt that can never be repaid. He furthermore declares that you have grown into a master artisan, and that he has nothing else to teach you. Inspired by your example, the timbermaster resolves to refine his own skills, and wishes you luck in your never-ending journey to become a better carpenter.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"
