1,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_SEQ_01","Taken by an inexplicable urge to wax lyrical, you decide to signify your commitment to the cause by incorporating the order's password, “wild rose,” into a line of improvised verse. Betraying no embarrassment, Minfilia accepts your whimsical utterance in the spirit it was intended, and welcomes you to the Scions. She then introduces you to its leading members: the scholars of Sharlayan, some of whom are familiar to you. Without further ado, you are assigned your first task─to investigate a series of crimes committed in Ul'dah, which the Scions suspect to be primal-related. Speak with Thancred, the debonair bard, to learn the details of your mission."
2,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_SEQ_02","Thancred believes that the caravan robbery and the recent spate of disappearances are connected. He suggests that you begin your investigation by visiting the scene of the suspected abductions. Make your way to Camp Drybone in eastern Thanalan, and seek the cooperation of a man named Isembard."

93,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000370_MINFILIA","Urianger. Have the documents arrived from the Students of Baldesion?"
94,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000380_URIANGER","Aye, my lady, they arrived but recently."
95,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000390_MINFILIA","We have received a request for aid from the Immortal Flames."
96,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000400_MINFILIA","Thancred, would you do the honors?"
97,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000410_THANCRED","It would be my pleasure."
98,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000420_THANCRED","Some days ago, a crystal caravan registered to Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern was waylaid and divested of its cargo."
99,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000430_THANCRED","But there is more. Within a bell of the robbery, several people were reported missing from the shantytown outside the city."
100,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000440_MINFILIA","At a glance, one would assume the involvement of bandits, kidnappers, and coincidence."
101,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000450_MINFILIA","Such crimes are hardly uncommon, and the Immortal Flames deal with their like almost every day."
102,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000460_MINFILIA","However, this time we have reason to believe that a primal is involved."
103,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000470_THANCRED","Aye, the evidence left behind implicates the Amalj'aa, who are known worshipers of Ifrit."
104,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000480_THANCRED","If we then consider the objects that were taken, there is no room left for doubt─the crimes were committed in the name of a primal."
105,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000490_MINFILIA","That you may better understand the nature of our struggle with the primals, I would have you play the leading role in this investigation."
106,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000500_MINFILIA","You have my thanks."
107,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000510_MINFILIA","If there is aught you wish to know, I recommend you speak with Thancred. He is well versed in the affairs of Ul'dah."

110,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_11","So then, your mission is to investigate a crystal robbery and a spate of abductions."
111,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_12","...Crimes which we believe to be connected. Assuming we are correct, it is like that any discoveries we make in relation to one will further our understanding of the other."
112,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_13","Now, since the attack on their caravan, our friends at Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern have doubled security over all their shipments."
113,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_14","In light of this, it is my judgment that the abductions should be our priority."
114,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_15","According to our preliminary findings, the majority of the missing were last seen in the vicinity of Camp Drybone, so that would seem a fine place to begin."
115,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_16","A fellow by the name of Isembard serves as the camp's de facto leader. Pay him a visit, and see that he gives us his full cooperation."
116,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_20","Aye, I'm Isembard. Here to search for the missing folk, I take it?"
117,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_21","Minfilia sent word that an adventurer fitting your description would be along."
118,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_22","She also warned us to be wary of the Amalj'aa. It seems we know who the culprits are, at the very least."
119,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_23","Now, I bear no official title at this camp, but the people here have come to look to me for leadership. You have my word that I'll do all I can to help see the victims safely returned."
