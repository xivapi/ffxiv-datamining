49,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_2","First of all, I want you to visit the aetheryte plaza. To get there, head west from here till you reach Emerald Avenue, then look to the north. You should see a giant, floatin' crystal called an aetheryte."
50,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_3","If it weren't for aetherytes, travelin' around Eorzea would be a damn sight more troublesome than it is. 'Course, you still need to attune with 'em before you can use 'em, so be sure to do that with the one in the plaza. You ever attuned with an aetheryte before, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? If not, just lay your hand on the thing and you'll see what I mean."
51,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_4","When you've done that, I want you to pay a visit to the Pugilists' Guild, over at the Platinum Mirage."
52,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_5","Assumin' those weapons of yours ain't just for show, you might consider trainin' there."

54,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_7","Goods from all across Eorzea and beyond turn up there every day. You'll have no trouble findin' armor, weapons, or anythin' else a fledglin' adventurer like yourself might need."
55,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_8","You might say that <Emphasis>everythin's</Emphasis> for sale here in Ul'dah─as long as you've got the gil."

58,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_11","Which is why I'm givin' you this letter. When you visit the exchange, find a gentleman named Seseroga and give it to him. He'll be happy to tell you about the markets once he's read it."

61,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_14","A lot of folk are lured to this city by the promise of wealth and power. What many of 'em fail to realize is that instead of chasin' after gil the moment they get here, they ought to be makin' friends."

That way, I won't spend my days worryin' that you're down to your smallclothes without a gil to your name."

65,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_21","I see you already walk the path of the pugilist. Yet your journey has only just begun."
66,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_22","I highly recommend you add your name to our roll, for there is no better place in all the realm to train in our discipline than here."
67,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_23","The origins of pugilism as we know it can be traced back to the staging of bare-handed bouts at the Coliseum. "
68,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_24","These contests attracted fighters from far and wide, bringing their myriad styles crashing together on the bloodsands."
69,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_25","Amidst this chaotic intermingling of styles, there rose a pugilist of singular strength and skill. This woman made it her life's mission to master every form she encountered, that she might refine her art."
70,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_26","Among her many song-worthy exploits, we pugilists remember her participation in a gladiator tournament most fondly. Back when bare-handed fighting was still seen as a pastime for peasants, she took on fully armed and armored gladiators, and effortlessly bested the lot of them."
71,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_27","Word of her feat spread across the realm like wildfire, of course, and Ul'dah swiftly transformed into a center of pugilism, with people flocking from all over to train under this master among masters."
72,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_28","The woman's name was Cornelia, and it is to her that the Pugilists' Guild owes its existence. The art practiced here is based on her all-encompassing style, and this training hall is modeled upon the one which she once built."
73,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_29","And there it is─a brief history of our guild."
74,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_30","I've told this tale a thousand times, but gods, it never fails to fan the flames of my fighting spirit!"
75,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_GAGARUNA_000_31","Now then, should you wish to proceed with enrollment, you must first obtain the guildmaster's approval. Let me know if you would like to meet him."
76,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_40","Hail, adventurer! Might you have come at the behest of Miss Momodi of the Quicksand?"
77,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_41","Excellent. Which brings us to the matter of the attunement fee─that will be one hundred thousand gil, if you please, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>."
78,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_42","...AHAHAHAHAHA! Apologies, but I do so relish the opportunity to make that jest. The look on your face was absolutely priceless! Ah, but the fact that you were so easily deceived suggests to me that you are unfamiliar with the use of aetherytes. Allow me to explain."
79,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_43","These crystalline agglomerations tap into aetherial energies, and are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another."
80,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_44","Perchance you have heard of Return and Teleport? Well, these transportation spells make direct use of the aetherytes and their connection to the flow of aether."
81,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_45","Given that there is an aetheryte in almost every corner of Eorzea, any adventurer with a mind to explore the realm will wish to seek out and attune <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> to each and every one!"
82,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_46","But even if you have no intention of wandering beyond the sultanate's borders, it would be prudent for you to attune yourself to any aetherytes you encounter from now on."
83,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_NENEBARU_000_47","I pray you found that informative. Should you wish to learn more about aetherytes or transportation magic, I should be happy to answer your questions."
84,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SYSTEM_000_48","You attune with the aetheryte.
You are now able to use the Return spell!"
85,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_50","And you are?
...Ho, a newly come adventurer. But of course. Yes, I am Seseroga. What can I do for you?"
86,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_51","Ah, you would have me teach you the ways of the marketplace? Very wise. As for my fee... What? You expect me to do it for <Emphasis>free</Emphasis>!? Surely you jest."
87,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_52","My dear adventurer, when you ask an Ul'dahn for a favor, you should at least <Emphasis>try</Emphasis> to make it worth his while. Judging by your garb, I rather doubt you could afford my services, but the fact you offer nothing is laughable."
88,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_53","Oh. Mistress Momodi instructed you to seek me out, did she? Hmph. Consider yourself fortunate to have such influential friends."
89,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_54","I shall be brief, and you shall be attentive."
90,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_55","You stand in the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, the busiest and most profitable marketplace in the sultanate."
91,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_56","Being advantageously situated in relation to the other city–states, Ul'dah's markets have ever served as both the literal and figurative centers of Eorzean commerce."
92,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_57","All the great overland trade routes lead to our city, and the majority of maritime trade between Vylbrand and Aldenard passes through our ports."
93,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_58","Because of this, countless companies and consortia have chosen Ul'dah as their base of operations. They see to it that this marketplace is awash with merchants and moneylenders, day and night."
94,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_59","Anything a man could ever desire can be purchased here─provided as he has sufficient funds."
95,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_60","Surely there's something you seek, adventurer? A deadlier sword, perhaps, or a shinier trinket? Whatever it is you want, the exchange will have it."
96,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_61","To the north, you will find merchants peddling armor and accessories, curatives and crafting materials."
97,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_62","And to the south, you will find weapons, tools, and an assortment of other useful items for sale."
98,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_63","Seek out a particular merchant, or browse to your heart's content. But do try to remain aloof should you find something that piques your interest. Decisions made in the heat of the moment are usually unwise, especially where coin is concerned."
99,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_64","Ahem. That is all the complimentary aid you shall have from me─and <Emphasis>far too much</Emphasis> for my taste."
100,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_SESEROGA_000_65","My regards to Momodi. Now, off with you!"
101,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_70","How was your tour of the city, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Get lost, did you?"
102,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_71","Aye, well, Ul'dah's a big place with lots to see and do─but wanderin' around aimlessly don't pay the bills. If you're serious about makin' a livin' here, you'll need to remember where things are."
103,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_72","So when you go explorin', explore like you've got a purpose, eh?"
104,"TEXT_MANWIL003_00569_MOMODI_000_73","All right, then! All that's left is for you to work hard, make money, and spend it here at the Quicksand!"
