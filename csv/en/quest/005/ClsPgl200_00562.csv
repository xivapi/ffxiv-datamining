1,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_SEQ_01","Recent events have left Hamon deeply depressed. Unable to muster up the will to train you, he bids you seek out Chuchuto for your next lesson."
2,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_SEQ_02","Chuchuto believes that if you go about your training the way that Hamon once did, you might serve to stoke the fires of his fighting spirit. To this end, she bids you go to the southern part of Drybone, and there perform a Bootshine combo on the trees that bear indentations. Doing so will stir hornet clouds from their hives. Defeat them and claim three of their stingers."
3,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_SEQ_03","You have obtained the required number of hornet stingers. Present them to Hamon at the Pugilists' Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_SEQ_04","As Chuchuto had expected, the hornet stingers remind Hamon of his younger days, and the man expresses his fervent desire to relive them again. Rather unexpectedly, however, he demands that you now fight him. Let your guildmaster know when you are ready to begin."
5,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_SEQ_05","No sooner does your bout with the guildmaster end than his old rival, Weggfarr Wideaxe, arrives on the scene with Rurukuta in tow. Having made a mockery of Hamon's efforts, Weggfarr challenges him to a public rematch, with the Pugilists' Guild itself as the prize for the winner. Speak with your guildmaster and learn his mind on the matter."
6,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_SEQ_06","Much to Chuchuto's dismay, Hamon is determined to face Weggfarr again. Back in his prime, the guildmaster defeated the hulking marauder, and he believes he can repeat the feat─with your help. Keep up your training, that your progress might inspire Hamon to regain his former strength.

※The next pugilist quest will be available from Hamon upon reaching level 25."

49,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_CHUCHUTO_000_5","Hrmmm... I was so hopeful that seeing you improve in leaps and bounds would spur Master Hamon out of his doldrums. It seems more must be done."
50,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_CHUCHUTO_000_7","Perhaps the end result is not so important as the manner in which you get there. In other words, if you were to train <Emphasis>precisely</Emphasis> as Master Hamon once did─overcome the selfsame challenges that he did in his youth─I daresay it would stoke the fires of his fighting spirit!"
51,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_CHUCHUTO_000_8","Listen well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Master once told me that he used to refine his combinations by provoking deadly creatures into unleashing their fury upon him. For this purpose, he often went to the southern part of Drybone to fight the hornet clouds there."
52,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_CHUCHUTO_000_9","To this day, the tree trunks that he struck to stir the vilekin from their hives bear the mark of his fists. I want you to seek out these trees, and do as Master Hamon once did─strike them with a Bootshine combo, and fight the hornet clouds that emerge."
53,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_CHUCHUTO_000_12","Once you have felled enough of the creatures to collect three of their stingers, return here and present them to Master Hamon. They will remind him of better days, I am sure of it!"

68,"TEXT_CLSPGL200_00562_WEGGFARR_000_37","But Holyfist ain't nothin' but a name these days, so I'm told. How do ye sleep at night, knowin' how flaccid ye've become?"
