1,"TEXT_MANWIL007_00551_SEQ_01","Having sworn you to secrecy, Momodi reveals that the royal crown has been stolen. According to her, if the theft were to be made public, it would tarnish the sultana's reputation. She suspects that the missive which Fufulupa found amongst Baldewyn's possessions was written by the perpetrators of this crime. Momodi bids you bear the letter to its intended recipient, Owyne of the Sultansworn, and offer your assistance."

Return to the Heart of the Sworn and find out if the Sultansworn have recovered the crown."
