2,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_SEQ_02","Upon arriving at Maelstrom Command, you are received by Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn herself, who pledges the full support of the Maelstrom in the forthcoming operation. Before risking direct confrontation with Titan, Y'shtola proposes that you learn more about your foe by speaking to former members of the Company of Heroes─the famous band of mercenaries who defeated the dread primal once before. She directs you to the Grey Fleet mills in lower La Noscea, where one such individual is said to reside."
