50,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_3","If it weren't for aetherytes, travelin' around Eorzea would be a damn sight more troublesome than it is.

You ever attuned with an aetheryte before, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? If not, just lay your hand on the thing and you'll see what I mean."

67,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_LULUTSU_000_23","A daunting prospect, I concede─but there is no other way if you mean to take to the bloodsands one day. And why wouldn't you? The Coliseum is only the most celebrated place of public entertainment in all of Ul'dah!"

77,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_NENEBARU_000_42","...AHAHAHAHAHA! Apologies, but I do so relish the opportunity to make that jest. The look on your face was absolutely priceless! Ah, but the fact that you were so easily deceived suggests to me that you are unfamiliar with the use of aetherytes. Allow me to explain."

81,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_NENEBARU_000_46","But even if you have no intention of wandering beyond the sultanate's borders, it would be prudent for you to attune yourself to any aetherytes you encounter from now on."
82,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_NENEBARU_000_47","I pray you found that informative. Should you wish to learn more about aetherytes or transportation magic, I should be happy to answer your questions."

You are now able to use the Return spell!"

...Ho, a newly come adventurer. But of course. Yes, I am Seseroga. What can I do for you?"
85,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_51","Ah, you would have me teach you the ways of the marketplace? Very wise. As for my fee... What? You expect me to do it for <Emphasis>free</Emphasis>!? Surely you jest."
86,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_52","My dear adventurer, when you ask an Ul'dahn for a favor, you should at least <Emphasis>try</Emphasis> to make it worth his while. Judging by your garb, I rather doubt you could afford my services, but the fact you offer nothing is laughable."
87,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_53","Oh. Mistress Momodi instructed you to seek me out, did she? Hmph. Consider yourself fortunate to have such influential friends."
88,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_54","I shall be brief, and you shall be attentive."
89,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_55","You stand in the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, the busiest and most profitable marketplace in the sultanate."
90,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_56","Being advantageously situated in relation to the other city–states, Ul'dah's markets have ever served as both the literal and figurative centers of Eorzean commerce."
91,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_57","All the great overland trade routes lead to our city, and the majority of maritime trade between Vylbrand and Aldenard passes through our ports."
92,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_58","Because of this, countless companies and consortia have chosen Ul'dah as their base of operations. They see to it that this marketplace is awash with merchants and moneylenders, day and night."
93,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_59","Anything a man could ever desire can be purchased here─provided as he has sufficient funds."
94,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_60","Surely there's something you seek, adventurer? A deadlier sword, perhaps, or a shinier trinket? Whatever it is you want, the exchange will have it."
95,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_61","To the north, you will find merchants peddling armor and accessories, curatives and crafting materials."
96,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_62","And to the south, you will find weapons, tools, and an assortment of other useful items for sale."
97,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_63","Seek out a particular merchant, or browse to your heart's content. But do try to remain aloof should you find something that piques your interest. Decisions made in the heat of the moment are usually unwise, especially where coin is concerned."
98,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_64","Ahem. That is all the complimentary aid you shall have from me─and <Emphasis>far too much</Emphasis> for my taste."
99,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_65","My regards to Momodi. Now, off with you!"
100,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_70","How was your tour of the city, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Get lost, did you?"
101,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_71","Aye, well, Ul'dah's a big place with lots to see and do─but wanderin' around aimlessly don't pay the bills. If you're serious about makin' a livin' here, you'll need to remember where things are."
102,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_72","So when you go explorin', explore like you've got a purpose, eh?"
103,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_73","All right, then! All that's left is for you to work hard, make money, and spend it here at the Quicksand!"
