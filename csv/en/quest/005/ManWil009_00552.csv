1,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_SEQ_01","The banquet is soon to begin. Put on the Voice of the Just and make for the Royal Promenade where Bartholomew awaits."
2,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_SEQ_02","At the banquet, Raubahn recounts the deeds of the half-remembered heroes whom Eorzeans now call the Warriors of Light. The tale triggers inside your mind a vision of the final moments of the Battle of Carteneau. When you subsequently come to your senses, you are surprised to find yourself in a room at the Hourglass, with no idea how you got there. Betraying a mixture of relief and glee, Momodi explains that you collapsed, and mentions that the General would like to see you. Make your way to the Hall of Flames and seek an audience with him."
3,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_SEQ_03","The Flame General declares that there is work to be done─and that he would have you do it. Speak to him again when you are ready to begin."

62,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_000080_RAUBAHN","Not to spoil your appetite, but Ul'dah is hardly so bountiful as this meal would have you believe. While we gorge ourselves, children starve in the streets."

72,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_000180_RAUBAHN","Allow me to explain. Before you came to Eorzea, there were others like you who fought the primals."
73,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_000190_RAUBAHN","Though they were not of this land, when the Garlean Empire threatened the realm, they helped bring together the three Grand Companies."
74,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_000200_RAUBAHN","And they stood with us at Carteneau, that fateful day five years ago..."

82,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_000280_RAUBAHN","It is a gift from Hydaelyn, Mother of all─and one She gave to you for a reason."
83,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_000290_RAUBAHN","Yours is no ordinary tale. If I am right, the fate of the realm may yet hang upon your deeds."

88,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_MOMODI_000_53","You sure you're gettin' enough rest, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? The life of an adventurer can be pretty taxin'."
89,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_MOMODI_000_54","Anyroad, I'm glad to see you're back to normal. No offense, but lookin' after you was gettin' a bit tiresome."
90,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_MOMODI_000_55","Oh, 'fore I forget, the General left a message for you. Said that when you're feelin' up to it, you should come and see him at the Hall of Flames."
91,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_MOMODI_000_56","Probably wants to finish the story he was tellin' you when you fell asleep."
92,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_RAUBAHN_000_60","I've been waiting for you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I trust you are fully recovered?"
93,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_RAUBAHN_000_61","Good, because there is much work to be done─work that I would have you do..."
94,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_SERENDIPITY_070","You want <Emphasis>what</Emphasis>!? You can't be serious! <Emphasis>Gods</Emphasis>..."
95,"TEXT_MANWIL009_00552_SERENDIPITY_071","Just this once, but remember─life is not a minstrel's song, and you aren't some chosen hero. So don't go around expecting people to forgive you no matter the reckless, irresponsible things you do."
