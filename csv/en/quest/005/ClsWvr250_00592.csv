1,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_SEQ_01","A sudden deluge of orders has the Weavers' Guild working at full stretch, and Redolent Rose cannot spare the time to attend a consultation with one of his clients. Go in the guildmaster's stead to the Gold Court and speak with Babawai and his daughter Kokomo."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_SEQ_02","Your meeting does not prove as enlightening as you had hoped due to the complete disinterest of your young client. Return to the Weavers' Guild and tell Redolent Rose what you have learned."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_SEQ_03","After a moment's consideration, Redolent Rose decides to craft a velveteen dress. Conscious of Babawai's reputation for exacting standards, he concludes that only the finest fabric will suffice. Weave a bolt of high-quality velveteen and deliver it to the guildmaster."
4,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_SEQ_04","The guildmaster praises your velveteen, and assures you that it will make a most magnificent dress─albeit one which he suspects Kokomo has no intention of wearing.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 30."

Amongst them was a commission for a bespoke dress, all aspects of which I had intended to handle personally. Alas, I have just this moment received yet another request─this time from Her Grace─which must, naturally, take precedence."

56,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_BABAWAI_021","As for what manner of dress... Simply put, I'll not have my Kokomo garbed in common cotton. A jeweler's daughter must be refined─<Emphasis>resplendent</Emphasis>. A ruby amongst the riffraff."

...Something “resplendent,” which isn't made of cotton, you say? <sigh> I might have known. His commissions rarely stipulate anything beyond “ostentatiously expensive.”"

61,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_REDOLENTROSE_042","Well, vanya silk would achieve the desired effect, though I doubt she would feel comfortable wearing such an extravagant dress. Velveteen, though...yes, velveteen might work."
