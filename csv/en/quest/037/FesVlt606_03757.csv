0,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_00","Lisette has an important announcement to share with one and all.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_01","Lisette cheerily explains to you that the votes have been all but counted, and announces that the winner of the contest is none other than Bert. She bids you accompany Bert as an unbiased observer, such that you might render a sound decision on her behalf. Bert then instructs you to wait just beyond his arranged meeting spot with your masked client.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_02","You accompany Bert─newly minted as this year's emissary of love─to visit your heretofore masked client, who reveals himself to be none other than Guildmaster Ywain of Lancers' Guild fame. Though somewhat skeptical, Ywain humors Bert's suggestion to take up woodworking, and the two of them make their way to the Carpenters' Guild where they are greeted by a skeptical Guildmaster Beatin. The ever-serious soldier stutters that he has come seeking a better understanding of love─a confession which Beatin, as is his wont, egregiously mishears and misinterprets as a desire to deeply understand <Emphasis>lumber</Emphasis>. Convinced that he has found a kindred spirit in his fellow guildmaster, Beatin whisks Ywain off to the depths of the Twelveswood, that they might bond over their newfound shared passion for the wonderful world of wood."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_03","His mission to find a passionate encounter for Ywain complete—at least, in the most charitable sense of the word—Bert eagerly suggests that you both return to Lady Lisette to deliver word of his triumph."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_04","Upon your return, Lady Lisette carefully weighs the events of the day. Though not entirely convinced at the outset, after asking your thoughts and reconsidering the matter for herself, she triumphantly declares Bert's trial a success. The passionate young man rejoices, and with her Lady Lisette's blessing, the newly crowned emissary of love steps confidently into his role as master of ceremonies for this year's Valentione's Day. Your own duty done as well, you are free to enjoy the festivities as you see fit before going forth and returning to your adventures."

86,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_BERT_000_051","Why, I daresay the man's sheer passion nigh outstrips my own! At least when it comes to wood, that is. I do hope Guildmaster Ywain was not too overwhelmed."
87,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_BERT_000_052","Still, our man was looking for an encounter full of ardor and affection, and he has certainly found one! For who is to say the man's meeting must involve the fairer sex? Man, woman, wood...in matters of the heart, I daresay the difference is immaterial. "
88,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_BERT_000_053","At any rate, Lady Lisette is surely beside herself waiting to hear word of my inevitable rousing success. Let us go together and share the triumphant tidings!"

91,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_060","Welcome back, my beloved friend! Bert has told me everything. To be perfectly honest with you, that was not precisely─or to be honest, not <Emphasis>at all</Emphasis> how I had envisioned everything working out..."
92,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_061","...Which is why I seek your opinion as one who has served me loyally in the name of love. What say you? Was Bert's unusual approach worthy of the title of emissary of ardor?"

94,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_A1_000_001","That depends on the two of them..."

96,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_A1_000_003","There <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> many types of love..."
97,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_062","I suppose you are right. Their relationship now might simply be one of master and student, but when two men bond over a love of wood, who knows what sparks might fly, and what passions may yet be kindled?"
98,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_063","Indeed it is. After all, until today poor Ywain scarcely spoke with anyone but stoic soldiers not unlike himself. Now, he has found a kindred spirit with whom he might bond over a love for the natural world around him. Who am I─or anyone─to say where this might lead?"
99,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_064","Do you mean to say that our friend Ywain might, like Master Beatin, find his love for trees transcends all? I am not certain that is the sort of ardor we should be encouraging, but still...I suppose a passion for wood is better than no passion at all."
100,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_065","At any rate, I do believe I have heard all I need to render my verdict. Hear me, Bert. By the powers invested in me by my forebears, I, Lisette de Valentione..."
101,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_066","...Do hereby declare you a full-fledged emissary of ardor! Congratulations, my young associate! I can quite honestly say I never expected to see this day."
102,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_067","And with that, I have no qualms whatsoever placing the full of this year's Valentione's Day proceedings under your charge."
103,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_LISETTE_000_068","Well, Bert? How does it feel to rise to the occasion? Have you aught to say to the darling adventurer who helped make this occasion possible?"

I'd be lying if I said I couldn't have done it without you─the results were quite decisive, after all─but nevertheless I most appreciate you tagging along every─well, <Emphasis>almost</Emphasis> every step of the way to offer your support!"
105,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_BERT_000_070","...And with that, if you'll excuse me, I do believe I have a job to do. You! Yes, you! Over there!
