※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANQIQ005_03798_SEQ_01","You engage in a stimulating conversation with the Great Serpent of Ronka, who─you surmise from the urgency and eagerness of its screeing─is keen to see the Stewards press deeper into the tunnels of Hopl's Stopple. Should you be inclined to heed its call, seek out Chaqurl Qhotl and see how you might best proceed.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANQIQ005_03798_SEQ_02","You speak with Qitarl Natl, who shares with you further gleanings from the excavation of the flooded tunnels, and Chaqurl Qhotl, who laments the sad fate of the catfish people who once crossed paths with his ancestors. But there is more troubling news at hand─Towarl Manol's symptoms have returned with a vengeance, and the sickness that afflicts her appears to be spreading about the Stopple. At the behest of the Qitari father and son, you resolve to travel to Fanow in their stead to acquire an additional supply of medicine from your Viis friends."
3,"TEXT_BANQIQ005_03798_SEQ_03","Master Lanille in Fanow is more than happy to provide you the medicine the Qitari require, but with it comes grim tidings─a malady similar to that which plagues the Qitari appears to have afflicted the Viis as well. Deeply concerned for the well-being of your forest-dwelling friends, you set off for the Stopple once more, hoping that the remedy will provide a temporary respite from the suffering until such time as a cure can be found."
4,"TEXT_BANQIQ005_03798_SEQ_04","Your return to the Stopple is greeted with grim news when Chaqurl Qhotl informs you that the sickness has spread in your absence, leaving even Qitarl Natl bedridden. As the young Qitari struggles to come to grips with the situation, Quinfort rushes to the scene in a panic and confirms your worst fears─the Night's Blessed of Slitherbough, too, have been stricken with the strange sickness, and your friend Valan lies unconscious in bed as you speak. Deeply distressed at this turn of events─and at the thought that the Qitari themselves might be responsible for spreading the disease around the Greatwood—Chaqurl resigns himself to calling off the excavation effort until a cure can be found, but is convinced otherwise by a timely interruption from the Great Serpent of Ronka. Believing this to be a sign that the very answer he seeks might be found in the tunnels below, he proclaims that the excavation will go on. Admiring the Qitari child's courage and composure in trying times, you resolve to speak to him and give him the encouragement he needs to go exploring without his father at his side."
5,"TEXT_BANQIQ005_03798_SEQ_05","Having descended into the tunnels with the great serpent at his side, Chaqurl Qhotl returns to the surface alone, but with triumphant news─the fourth stela has been found. As the Qitari child tells it, unlike the previous three, it is in pristine condition, and the etchings upon it appear to provide the very answer that you seek. Guided by the divine wisdom of the great serpent, you resolve to scour the forest for the rare variety of Ronkan moss that may stay the spread of the terrible pox that now plagues the forest."
6,"TEXT_BANQIQ005_03798_SEQ_06","You succeed in harvesting the moss and delivering it safely to the Stopple. At Chaqurl Qhotl's direction, the remedy is brewed and swiftly administered to the sick, who begin to show immediate signs of recovery─just as foretold by the great serpent. Before long, Qitarl Natl is back on his feet, greatly relieving his son. You are curious to speak with the elder Steward and hear his thoughts about the spread of the mysterious sickness."
7,"TEXT_BANQIQ005_03798_SEQ_07","A recovered Qitarl Natl shares with you his theory on the spread of the disease, which he believes to have been an unfortunate side effect of the migration of his own people from the far-flung reaches of the forest. Troubled by the implications and yet taking heart that it was the wisdom of his forefathers that quelled the epidemic, he vows that the Stewards will be vigilant against any similar outbreaks in the future. With the four stelae finally unearthed and restored to their original form, the Qitari resolve to continue their excavation and study, that further lost knowledge may be gleaned."
