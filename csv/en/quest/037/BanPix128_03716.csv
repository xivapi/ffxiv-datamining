49,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_002","Not me! And that's why I made a love potion! Well, a dream love potion. A real one would be downright creepy! We fae do have some scruples, you know."
50,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_003","The problem is, I'm new to all of this alchemy nonsense, and I have no idea if my potion will work! I keep trying to sneak up on sleeping Nu Mou to test it, but it's like they can smell me coming!"
51,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_004","I'm sure that you could manage it, though! And I <Emphasis>know</Emphasis> you wouldn't want to stand in the way of true love! Well, fake true love. Well, dream fake true love. Anyway! Go and test the potion!"

55,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_NUMOU03716_000_013","What brings you here today? And looking so lovely, I might add! Yes... I daresay I've never seen such a divine visage in all my life..."
56,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_NUMOU03716_000_014","W-Wait! I didn't mean to express my undying affectio─ Oh no! I've done it again!"
57,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_NUMOU03716_000_015","Please, um... Please read this, when you have a moment. Which will likely be never, as I'm sure you're most busy being clever and courageous and─ Er, forget that I said anything!"
58,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_NUMOU03716_000_016","Oh, I knew the leafmen would come for me! It was only a matter of time!"
59,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_020","You tested it? And? And!?"

61,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_022","Hmm... Oh <Emphasis>dear</Emphasis>... Well, that's─ Oooh. And... Ahahaha! Haha... Oh, that doesn't even rhyme! HahahaHAHAHA!"
62,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_023","Haha... <wheeze> Ahem! You probably shouldn't look at this. It's <Emphasis>painfully</Emphasis> embarrassing. For them, and also for you. But don't worry─the potion will wear off after a while, and they won't remember a thing!"
63,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_024","It looks like I might need to water it down a bit for next time, though. There's smitten, and then there's...whatever in the name of Titania that drivel was supposed to be. Back to the cauldron I go!"
64,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_025","Huh. That's interesting. Now, if they had seen an irresistibly attractive leafman, it might still be usable, but that doesn't seem to be the case..."
65,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_026","Maybe it didn't work because Nu Mou are too different from you mortals? Or maybe that specific Nu Mou has a bizarre fixation on leafmen! I could check their dreams to make sure, but I'm a little afraid of what I might find..."
66,"TEXT_BANPIX128_03716_UINNEE_000_027","Best to try a different formula, I think! I can count on you to test a new batch when I'm done, right? Of course I can!"
