50,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_UINNEE_000_003","I wouldn't mind so much if it weren't for the fact our pets are supposed to be gathering flower seeds for use in dreams. Go and put a stop to this silliness, would you?"

A Fuath to be reckoned with, evildoers frozen in fear!♪
In the name of joy, he dances his merry jig!♪
Let none keep him from the enchanted flying pig!♪"
53,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_TALLFUATH_000_011","Oh, porxie, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways! But why must you always flee when I draw near? Why, I ask youuu!"
54,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_TALLFUATH_000_012","Me, bothering the porxies!? Never!"
55,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_TALLFUATH_000_013","The mere thought I could be causing them distress has left me quite flabbergasted! And to think they would spurn my affections...it is preposterous, I tell you!"
56,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_TALLFUATH_000_014","I was merely passing through to trade with the Nu Mou when I saw their precious pink companions. That adorable snout, that curly tail... It was love at first sight! Wait for me, porxies!"

60,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_SCAVENGER_000_018","And if the pixies find me, they'll turn me into one of those leafmen! It's high time I quit this godsforsaken place!"

63,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_FAKEMYSTEL_000_021","Chasing porxies? Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I was. It's a bit hard to keep up with them, though. Perhaps I need some more practice with this “one foot in front of the other” business!"
64,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_FAKEMYSTEL_000_022","And if the other pixies have a problem with me chasing those flappy-eared porkers, I could leave them alone, I suppose. After all, 'tis hardly fitting for a “lady” to engage in such unseemly behavior!"
65,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_UINNEE_000_030","So I take it the porxies will be resuming their duties? Good. I won't let them shirk their responsibilities! Not even if they're cute and adorable and I want to squeeze them and squeeze them until... Gah!"
66,"TEXT_BANPIX115_03703_UINNEE_000_031","No! I mustn't allow them to beguile me! I have a job to do! And for your part in...whatever this was, I'm making you an honorary “Protector of Porxies”!"
