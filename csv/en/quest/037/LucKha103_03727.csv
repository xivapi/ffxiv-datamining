1,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_01","In distressed tones, Noalle informs you that an inquisitor has come and taken her mother away. Without delay, you rush off towards the Arc of the Worthy, to Audaine's aid."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_02","You arrive to find not only Audaine and the inquisitor, but a dragon and dragonet unsuccessfully trying to gain entry into the Holy See. It is revealed that the dragon is none other than Audaine's husband, Marcelloix, whom the inquisitor is determined to punish as a heretic. However, Francel reminds him that, under new laws, those accused of heresy are to be accorded fair hearing, and volunteers to take Marcelloix and the dragonet, Ehll Tou, into his care. The tense confrontation thus ended, you all make your way to the Firmament to further discuss the situation."
3,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_03","Back at the Firmament, you consider what might be done with Marcelloix, who, as a heretic and dragon both, places his family in a difficult situation. Having once been abandoned by her husband, Audaine is understandably upset, and asks for time to decide whether or not she will take him back. Having had a gutful of men's troubles, the dragonet, Ehll Tou, flies off on her own to see the district, and Francel bids you go after her lest she cause alarm among the residents."
4,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_04","You find Ehll Tou watching the residents of the Firmament with great interest, but otherwise doing no harm. With some convincing, you succeed in persuading the dragonet to rejoin the others at Saint Roelle's Dais."
5,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_05","Francel has informed the residents of the Firmament of your draconic guests. Yet while all now understand the situation, whether they accept it is another question. At that moment, two citizens approach Francel and voice their aversion towards the man-turned-dragon. At the young lord's behest, they grudgingly withhold their judgment, but Marcelloix is made to be keenly aware that his is an unwelcome presence."

61,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_INQUISITOR03727_000_904","Ah, Lord Francel. We stopped these two dragons attempting to enter the Holy See."
62,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_INQUISITOR03727_000_905","The larger claimed to be related to this woman. Thus did I bring her hither to verify the truth."

71,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_MARCELLOIX_000_914","Whether it's because of myself or the blood, I can't say, but my transformation was long and painful. By the time I had recovered, the war had already ended."
72,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_MARCELLOIX_000_915","To make matters worse, I found I couldn't revert to my original form. I took to wandering aimlessly until I chanced to encounter Ehll Tou here, who encouraged me to return home."

88,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_927","Come with me, then─to the Firmament!"
89,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FONCRINEAU_000_030","Lord Francel has told me all. In defending the defenseless, he acted as a true knight should. Full proud am I of him."
90,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_040","It appears all are present. Good."
91,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_041","So, Marcelloix, Ehll Tou. Though you are my guests, I trust you can appreciate that your troubles are not yet over."
92,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_042","Yours in particular, Marcelloix. Though you are Ishgardian, as a heretic and dragon both, you place your family in an exceedingly difficult position."
93,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_043","But ere I speak further, we should hear Audaine's thoughts on the matter."
94,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_AUDAINE_000_044","It's only because our nation has changed that I can admit this now...but I too once supported Lady Iceheart's vision."
95,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_AUDAINE_000_045","I couldn't well commit myself to her cause, though. That would mean forsaking our family."
96,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_AUDAINE_000_046","But he did so anyway! He forsook us, left us to fend for ourselves! And...and look at him now!"
97,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_AUDAINE_000_047","Worse still, he's brazen enough to show his face in Ishgard and runs afoul of an inquisitor! If it weren't for milords' intervention, we might have been executed there and then!"
98,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_AUDAINE_000_048","Forgive me...but I don't know. After all that's happened, I don't know if I can─if I <Emphasis>want</Emphasis> to take him back. Please give me some time to think."
99,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_MARCELLOIX_000_049","I...I just wanted to see the two of you again..."
100,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_050","Ack! You finally meet your family, and all you can do is stammer and sulk? Have some stones, for heavens' sake!"
101,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_051","But enough of your tedious troubles! I came here to see a city, and I'm going to see one!"
102,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_052","W-Wait!"
103,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_053","Apologies, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but will you not go and keep an eye on Ehll Tou? I've not had the chance to inform the residents, and it would not do to cause panic."
104,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_054","You have my gratitude. Now, it seems she headed into the New Nest. If you hurry, you should be able to find her."
105,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_060","It isn't safe for Marcelloix to be alone either. I shall remain with him."
106,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_MARCELLOIX_000_065","Audaine... Noalle..."
107,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_AUDAINE_000_066","This is finer a home than anything we'd ever dreamed of. We can't thank you and Lord Francel enough."
108,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_AUDAINE_000_067","But as to my husband... Forgive me, but I still need time to think..."

110,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_070","Hmmm, it seems men don't change very much as they grow. How ever do they become able to fly, I wonder..."

112,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_071","Ack! As I've said already, I won't harm anyone! I'll have you know that my sire is Gullinbursti of the noble line of Ratatoskr, and like our esteemed ancestor, I will fill the skies with beauteous songs!"
113,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_072","And though we may not have met before, I know who you are. Oh yes, my sire, Gullinbursti, has told me much and more about you."
114,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_073","Now, you may be wondering what events led to my being here. I've been on a journey to learn the ways of men, you see, but one I met was more interested in skewering me than speaking. I mightn't be alive if Marcelloix hadn't come to my aid."
115,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_074","Though our kinds are meant to be at peace again, not all men are ready to accept dragons as friends. The opposite is true too, of course."
116,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_075","Look, I'd sooner not be caught by unfriendly men either, so perhaps I'll return with you after all."
117,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_EHLLTOU_000_080","Is he <Emphasis>still</Emphasis> stammering and sulking? Hopeless, I tell you..."
118,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_FRANCEL_000_090","It seems there was no alarm caused. My thanks for finding Ehll Tou, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
