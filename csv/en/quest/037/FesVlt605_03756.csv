※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT605_03756_SEQ_01","Lisette cheerily explains to you that the votes have been all but counted, and announces that the winner of the contest is none other than Astrid. She bids you accompany Astrid as an unbiased observer, such that you might render a sound decision on her behalf. Astrid then instructs you to wait just beyond her arranged meeting spot with your masked client.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT605_03756_SEQ_02","You accompany Astrid─newly minted as this year's emissary of love─to visit your heretofore masked client, who reveals himself to be none other than Guildmaster Ywain of Lancers' Guild fame. Though somewhat skeptical, he takes her suggestion to expand his horizons to heart, and the two of them make their way to the Leatherworkers' Guild where Ywain is scheduled to deliver a shipment of animal hides. Upon their arrival the all-too-serious soldier promptly manages to make a fool of himself by confessing his search for love to Guildmaster Geva. As she eyes Ywain in a manner that suggests she wants to turn <Emphasis>his</Emphasis> hide into a sack, the three of you are joined by none other than the notorious naturalist Marcette. Spying the collection of rare animal skins in Ywain's possession, she swiftly volunteers him to be her newest research assistant, whisking him off to parts unknown without so much as a second thought."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT605_03756_SEQ_03","Her mission to introduce Ywain to a member of the fairer sex accomplished─at least, in the most charitable sense of the word─Astrid suggests that the both of you return to deliver a report to Lady Lisette."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT605_03756_SEQ_04","Upon your return, Lady Lisette carefully weighs the events of the day. Though not entirely convinced at the outset, after asking your thoughts and reconsidering the matter for herself, she triumphantly declares Astrid's trial a success. Astrid rejoices, and with her sister's blessing, the newly crowned emissary of love steps confidently into her hard-earned position as mistress of ceremonies for this year's Valentione's Day. Your own duty done as well, you are free to enjoy the festivities as you see fit before going forth and returning to your adventures."
