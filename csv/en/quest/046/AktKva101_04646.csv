1,"TEXT_AKTKVA101_04646_SEQ_01","Acting as the facilitator for the guildship's odd job initiative, Shallow Moor hands you an explanatory missive from Momodi. The letter details a request from one of the sultana's personal attendants, asking you to travel to Thanalan. After confirming your assent, Shallow Moor contacts Momodi to arrange a meeting, and you find yourself scheduled to speak with one “Kokoshu” outside the Quicksand in Ul'dah."
2,"TEXT_AKTKVA101_04646_SEQ_02","Kokoshu quickly sets the record straight on who your true client is: the sultana, Nanamo Ul Namo. The lady-in-waiting tells you the tale of an unusual gate discovered in the damaged sections of the Sil'dihn aqueducts, and of Nanamo's desire to see it firsthand. Upon your agreement to help the sultana in this endeavor, Kokoshu cedes the meeting to Nanamo herself. Her Royal Majesty elaborates that the symbol on this portal matches the design of a key gifted to her by her parents, and she is adamant that they meant for her to explore whatever lies beyond. As for your part, Nanamo feels that you are her best choice of escort if she wishes to investigate unimpeded by overprotective guards. It seems she has arranged for you to enter the Sil'dihn ruins via the entrance in central Thanalan, whilst she arrives undetected through the palace's secret tunnels..."
3,"TEXT_AKTKVA101_04646_SEQ_03","The curious-but-dutiful foreman directs you inside the ruins, where you are to rendezvous with Nanamo and her mysterious key.

6,"TEXT_AKTKVA101_04646_SEQ_06","You speak with Kokoshu─who is actually Nanamo in disguise─and she reflects upon the discoveries you made together during your recent adventure. Convinced that the Sil'dihn Subterrane yet holds far more places of interest to explore, the sultana bids you join her on another foray─when time permits, of course. For now, however, she must return to her usual affairs of state, and it is the real Kokoshu who arrives next to thank you profusely for your cooperation. The circle of gratitude, however, will not be complete until you convey the lady-in-waiting's warm regards to Shallow Moor back in Sharlayan..."
