1,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_SEQ_01","Y'shtola, relieved at the safe conclusion to her experiment, deliberates how best to augment the talisman for your forthcoming expedition into the void. Not wanting to further burden the alchemists of the Great Work, you settle on bringing the problem to the Garlond Ironworks operation in Rhalgr's Reach. If anyone can find a solution, it will be Cid and his innovative engineers."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_SEQ_02","Fascinated by your commission, Cid agrees to fashion a protective case for the talisman, even promising to enlist the incorrigible Nero and his trove of data on the Thirteenth. With one solution pending, Y'shtola suggests a return to the Great Work, where Nidhana has hopefully made progress on the construction of the mock Atomos."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_SEQ_03","Nidhana is pleased to speak of her own good fortune in ascertaining the simulacrum's necessary components, as well as receiving unexpected offers of assistance from the High Crucible's alchemists. Despite the imminent possibility of travel to the void, however, Vrtra remains hesitant about resuming the search for his sister. Strong words of encouragement from Nahbdeen and the assembled Hannish crowd nearly convince him to reach a decision, but it is your contribution which finally moves the great wyrm to “take heart.” Thus bolstered in spirit, Vrtra announces he will trust Radz–at–Han to his people for a time, and attempt what he has dreamed of for five thousand long years."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_SEQ_04","Although glad of Estinien's participation, Y'shtola advises against involving the other ostensibly disbanded Scions in your impending venture into the void. Similarly, she would prefer to avoid attracting attention by basing the expedition out of the Rising Stones─an issue Varshahn means to remedy after a return to Meghaduta."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_SEQ_05","A quick word to a palace official, and it seems that guest chambers will soon be at your disposal for use as a new headquarters─once the occupying mounds of treasure have been formally allocated for the Khalzahl Foundation, that is. As your various preparations proceed apace, you can almost hear the door to the Thirteenth─and a new adventure─begin to creak open..."

57,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_YSHTOLA_000_016","As we saw, the warding scale can be effective at protecting the bearer from other sources of aetheric corruption. Nevertheless, the talisman's durability will need to be improved if it is to withstand the void's influence for a prolonged length of time."
58,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_YSHTOLA_000_017","And I think that is a problem we can address without involving the brilliant but busy alchemists who created it. Who do we know who excels at this kind of structural augmentation?"

79,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_065","All right, let's take a look at this talisman of yours. You said there were signs of degradation?"
80,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_066","Hm, it seems some manner of corrosion has set in around a scratch on its surface─much as the void's corruption seeped into Nero through his wounds. In which case, our best bet may be to simply prevent the scale from being damaged in the first place."

82,"TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_068","We have a coating agent for strengthening trinkets and the like, but I'd be wary of applying any compound which might upset the scale's delicate alchemical balance. Far safer to dress it in armor."
