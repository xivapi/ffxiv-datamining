1,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_SEQ_01","Ser Marcelain explains that the damage Iceheart inflicted on Ishgard's arcane barrier has allowed the dragons to land directly upon the Steps of Faith─the bridge which spans the Sea of Clouds between the Gates of Judgement and the city proper. You are to take up position on the Steps of Faith, and aid the Temple Knights in defending the vital structure against the Dravanian Horde."
2,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_SEQ_02","You have succeeded in driving the Dravanian Horde from the Steps of Faith. Return in triumph to the Gates of Judgement."
3,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_SEQ_03","As the remnants of the Dravanian Horde take to the skies in disarray, Ishgard's weary defenders breathe a sigh of relief. The siege is ended. Speak with Alphinaud at the Gates of Judgement and find out how your allies fared in the battle at the Steel Vigil."
4,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_SEQ_04","Moments after greeting Alphinaud, you are joined by a grateful Ser Aymeric, who humbly thanks you for your service. When the lord commander subsequently takes his leave, Alphinaud triumphantly declares that the stage has been set for Ishgard's return to the Eorzean Alliance. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll, and report your success to Minfilia."
5,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_SEQ_05","Minfilia greets your return with a mixture of triumph and relief. Having snuffed out the Dravanian threat, it is time to enjoy a well-earned rest."

49,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_000_000","Ere you commit yourself to the siege, you should know what it is you are tasked with defending. Beyond the Gates of Judgement lie the Steps of Faith─a great bridge of stone that leads directly to the city of Ishgard."
50,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_000_001","More than simply a means to cross the Sea of Clouds, the bridge serves as a foundation for the arcane wards that form the barrier we call Daniffen's Collar."
51,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_000_002","Alas, in dispelling the barrier's outermost layer, that thrice-damned witch Iceheart stripped the bridge of its protection, and thus are the dragons now able to land unhindered upon the Steps of Faith."
52,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_000_003","Should the Dravanians succeed in destroying the remainder of the wards, the winged devils will be free to swarm within the city itself."
53,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_000_004","Needless to say, we cannot suffer that to happen. It shall be our task as defenders to prevent any harm from coming to those parts of the bridge wherein the wards are sealed."
54,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_100_004","Three yet remain, and we have dispatched our forces accordingly. I would ask you and your comrades to accompany our defenders at the outermost ward."

58,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_PAPALYMO_130_004","Indeed. To do otherwise would go against all that Master Louisoix has taught us."
59,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_PAPALYMO_135_004","As for where we may be of most assistance, I think it prudent we divide into two groups. Yda and I will join the rear guard."
60,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_YDA_140_004","Right! If the dragons should reach us, we'll be sure to give them what for."
61,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_000_005","Thank you. All of you. Pray speak with me again when your preparations are complete, and together we shall stand against the Horde!"

69,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_MARCELAIN_000_031","Yet you yielded not an ilm in the face of dragons that would turn my brother knights' blood to ice. The Fury Herself must walk at your side!"
70,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_CHAUNOLLET_000_032","Nay, I'll not deny it: without your skill and fortitude, the city would now be ash. Would that more of your adventuring brethren possessed such qualities."
71,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_LOANNE_000_034","You have served us well, adventurer─the Temple Knights would have been hard-pressed indeed to turn back the Horde alone. Mayhap 'tis time I returned to the practice yard..."

81,"TEXT_XXCUSE607_04591_ALPHINAUD_000_045","With the Dravanian Horde thus weakened and scattered, the threat to Ishgard has been greatly diminished."
