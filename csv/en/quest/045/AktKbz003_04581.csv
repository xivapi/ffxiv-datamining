1,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_01","Fourchenault is now convinced the blasphemy you seek is Nerva. Knowing these monstrosities often mimic the behavior of their originators, he seeks to know more about Nerva, that he might better understand the threat you face. To that end, he bids you accompany him to speak with captives of the IIIrd Legion held in custody at Camp Broken Glass. "
2,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_02","After conferring with the camp's intelligence officer, they believe it best you speak with Vergilia, legatus of the IIIrd Legion. She tells you of Nerva's last whereabouts, but before you have time to ponder her words, Kan-E-Senna arrives. She is all but certain the barrier protecting the Tower of Babil is fueled by ambient aether being drawn towards the tower. To be certain, she intends to examine the area's aetheric currents with her own eyes, and invites you to accompany her."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_03","Kan-E-Senna casts out her senses, and after a few moments, her suspicions are confirmed─the area's ambient aether is indeed being drawn toward the tower. Her assessment of the situation is soon interrupted, however, by the appearance of Nero. Being in a magnanimous mood, he tells you what he learned in the Tower of Babil─namely, that Varis's heart is being used to gather aether to power the shield protecting the tower. Vergilia, having vague recollections of her time enthralled to Anima, believes she knows where to find it. Knowing where to begin your search, Lorens suggests splitting into two groups─a small unit to breach the facility holding Varis's heart, and another together with your main force to breach the Tower of Babil once its defenses are down.

No sooner does Lorens take his leave with Yugiri, Fordola, and Vergilia than Fourchenault receives an emergency message via linkpearl. A number of refugees have left Camp Broken Glass, heading in the direction of the Tower of Babil."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_04","Together with Fourchenault, you begin your search of Regio Urbanissima, but can find neither hide nor hair of them. He suggests searching elsewhere.

5,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_05","Try as you might, you fail to find any trace of the wayward refugees. But Fourchenault is not deterred, insisting you continue the search."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_06","While surveying the area, you hear a scream in the distance. You run toward the cry without a moment's hesitation."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_07","You find the refugees at last, but they are being attacked by beasts descended from the tower. Weapon drawn, you plunge headlong into battle."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_08","The refugees are none the worse for wear, but learning that Nerva has been transformed into a monster understandably dampened their spirits. Fourchenault reminds them there are yet ways for them to overcome their dire circumstances, even going so far as to invite them to join his survey team on the moon. They balk at the proposition, but much to your surprise, Nero proves the catalyst to kindle their interest. Thus inspired to pursue this new endeavor, they return to the camp, leaving you to prepare for your confrontation with the blasphemy Nerva."
