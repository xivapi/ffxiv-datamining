※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANARK004_04548_SEQ_01","Thanks to their improved living conditions, Svarna's hippos are more energetic than ever, and business for the Riders is booming. Trna is informing you that would-be workers have gathered in hopes of hippo-based employment when Ogul arrives before you in a state of distress─and odd dress. She claims that a Gajasura calling himself “Acala” has injured a Rider and stolen a hippo cart, so Trna asks both you and Ogul to accompany her to the Shroud of the Samgha in hopes of evening the score with this hippo-stealing bandit.

Such a show of strength, he claims, will both prove his worth to the tribe that rejected him, and grant his compatriots sanctuary. While rebuking his threats, Trna seems moved by his plight, seeing in this stranger vestiges of her past self. Acala, in turn, awkwardly praises the Hippo Riders and swears he will one day take Svarna for his people. Before Trna can object, Acala rides off on the stolen hippo cart, leaving her in equal parts frustration and uncertainty."

Trna has Maru open a meyhane on the premises, in hopes of recruiting adventurers and strengthening security in Svarna. With more people than ever milling about, the atmosphere is optimistic even as inevitable conflict with Acala looms in the distance... "
