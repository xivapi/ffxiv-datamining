60,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ERENVILLE_000_012","The former depicts the cessation of hostilities between the Mamool Ja and Xbr'aal in the forests of Yak T'el. Specifically near a village called Iq Br'aax."
61,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_WUKLAMAT_000_013","That's where I was born, if you recall. I haven't been back there since Papa took me in when I was a baby."
62,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ERENVILLE_000_014","Where the Lay of the Brotherhood takes place, however, is unclear. In the saga, it is said that a foreign explorer came seeking an audience with the Dawnservant...but little more than that."
63,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ALPHINAUD_000_015","Eorzea has a similar tale─the explorer Ketenramm befriended a two-headed king known as the Autarch before commencing his travels across Tural."

65,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_WUKLAMAT_000_017","Your two-headed king certainly sounds like Papa. So this Ketenramm fellow must have come to Tuliyollal!"
66,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ERENVILLE_000_018","But if he indeed arrived some eighty years ago, the capital may not have been built yet. Vestiges of Yok Huy architecture notwithstanding."

70,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ERENVILLE_000_022","One of the grandest in Tural, once upon a time─and the seat of the Mamool Ja's homeland. It too lies in Yak T'el, not far from Iq Br'aax."
71,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ALISAIE_100_022","Then all things considered, Yak T'el seems the obvious choice for our next destination."

95,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_MABLU_000_069","According to him, the design imitates an accessory worn by a foreign mage he met at market some twenty years ago. Little did he know that charming taste of salt would prove to be a commercial triumph!"
96,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_KRILE_000_070","A foreign mage wearing this earring could only be Grandfather. Did the merchant happen to mention which market?"

99,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_KRILE_000_073","Is it mere coincidence that brought my grandfather there? Or..."
