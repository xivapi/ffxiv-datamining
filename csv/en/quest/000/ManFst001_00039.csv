50,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_BERTENNANT_000_3","Before you rush off and begin pestering every second citizen for work, I suggest you make yourself known at the Carline Canopy. That's the headquarters of the local Adventurers' Guild, in case you were wondering."

55,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_21","A wide-eyed and wondering young adventurer, come to put your name down at the guild, I assume?"
56,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_22","Actually...haven't you registered with us already? There's something strikingly familiar about you, but I can't for the life of me remember when or where we might have met."
57,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_23","Oh, I probably just have you confused with another adventurer─dozens of you come through here every day, after all. Now, where was I? Ah, yes."
58,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_24","Welcome. Miounne's my name, or Mother Miounne as most call me, and the Carline Canopy is my place."
59,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_25","As the head of the Adventurers' Guild in Gridania, I have the honor of providing guidance to the fledgling heroes who pass through our gates."

61,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_27","In return, we expect you to fulfill your duties as an adventurer by assisting the people of Gridania. A fine deal, wouldn't you agree?"
62,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_28","To an outsider's eyes, all may seem well with our nation, but naught could be further from the truth. The people live in a state of constant apprehension."
63,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_29","The Ixal and various gangs of common bandits provide an unending supply of trouble─trouble compounded by the ever-present threat of the Garlean Empire to the north. And that is to say nothing of the Calamity..."
64,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_30","Even now, the wounds have barely begun to heal. Ah, but I speak of it as if you were there. Forgive me. Five years past, Eorzea was well-nigh laid to waste when a dread wyrm emerged from within the lesser moon, Dalamud, and rained fire upon the realm. It is this which people call “the Calamity.”"
65,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_31","Scarcely a square malm of the Twelveswood was spared the devastation. Yet despite the forest's extensive wounds, not a soul among us can recall precisely how it all happened."
66,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_32","I am well aware of how improbable that must sound to an outsider... It <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> improbable. But it's also true. For reasons we can ill explain, the facts surrounding the Calamity are shrouded in mystery. There are as many versions of events as there are people willing to recount them."
67,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_33","Yet amidst the hazy recollections and conflicting accounts, all agree on one thing: that Eorzea was saved from certain doom by a band of valiant adventurers."
68,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_34","Whatever else we've misremembered, none of us have forgotten the heroes who risked life and limb for the sake of the realm. And yet...whenever we try to say their names, the words die upon our lips."
69,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_35","And whenever we try to call their faces to mind, we see naught but silhouettes amidst a blinding glare."
70,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_36","Thus have these adventurers come to be known as “the Warriors of Light.”"
71,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_37","...Ahem. Pray do not feel daunted by the deeds of legends. We do not ask that you become another Warrior of Light, only that you do what you can to assist the people of Gridania."
72,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_38","Great or small, every contribution counts. I trust you will play your part."
73,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_39","You have my gratitude!"
74,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_40","All that's left, then, is to conclude the business of registration. Here's a quill. Scrawl your name right <Emphasis>there</Emphasis>."
75,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_41","Oh, and I would appreciate it if you used your <Emphasis>real</Emphasis> name─there is a special place in the seventh hell for those who use “amusing” aliases."
76,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_42","...<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, hm? And you're quite <Emphasis>sure</Emphasis> that isn't an amusing alias?"
77,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_43","Very well. From this moment forward, you are a registered adventurer of Gridania, nation blessed of the elementals and the bounty of the Twelveswood. The guild expects great things from you."
78,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_WOODWAILERLEAD_000_44","Look at what just arrived─another godsdamned adventurer..."
79,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_45","Don't you start with that. Adventurers are the very salve that Gridania needs."
80,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_46","The Elder Seedseer herself bade us welcome them with open arms. Do you mean to disregard her will?"
81,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_WOODWAILERLEAD_000_47","Of course not! Lest you forget, it is my sworn duty to uphold the peace! Am I to blame if outsiders bring mistrust upon themselves?"
82,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_WOODWAILERLEAD_000_48","You─adventurer! Mind that you do not cause any trouble here, or I shall personally cast you out of this realm and into the seventh hell."
83,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_49","Ahem. Pay that outburst no mind. He meant only to...counsel you. Suspicious characters have been prowling the Twelveswood of late, you see, and the Wood Wailers feel they cannot afford to take any chances."
84,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_50","As is often the way with folk who live in isolation, Gridanians are wont to mistrust things they do not well know, your good self included. Fear not, however─given a catalog of exemplary deeds, and no more than a handful of years, the locals will surely warm to you."
85,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_51","On behalf of my fellow citizens, I welcome you to Gridania. May you come to consider our nation as your own in time."
86,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_MIOUNNE_000_52","Now then, you may depend on old Mother Miounne to teach you a few things that every adventurer should know."
87,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_SYSTEM_000_60","This concludes the introductory game tutorial."
88,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_SYSTEM_000_61","You have taken the first step as an adventurer in the city of Gridania."
89,"TEXT_MANFST001_00039_SYSTEM_000_62","Listen well to the wisdom of Mother Miounne, then go forth and discover the incredible adventures that await you!"
