1,"TEXT_CLSHRV011_00013_SEQ_01","Unable to reconcile her conflicting feelings regarding the Botanists' Guild serving the war effort that has brought such turmoil to the once-tranquil Twelveswood, Fufucha has made the grave decision to resign her position as guildmaster. Yannie at the Greatloam Growery would assign you a task in the former guildmaster's stead."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV011_00013_SEQ_02","Yannie would convince her friend Fufucha not to abandon the guild, and seeks your aid. Travel to the Timberlord's Lodge, west of Skyfire Locks in the Coerthas central highlands, and seek the counsel of Roiteloin, a former apprentice of Fufucha's."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV011_00013_SEQ_03","Roiteloin sympathizes deeply with Fufucha's dilemma, and has devised a plan that he believes will lift her spirits and impel her to reconsider her decision. Gather for him three logs of spruce, a type of lumber still rare in these lands. Use the Truth of Forests technique to identify unspoiled mature trees that appear at 9 a.m. (Eorzea time) to harvest spruce logs."
4,"TEXT_CLSHRV011_00013_SEQ_04","Roiteloin explains that the spruce logs you gathered are sorely needed by the people of Coerthas, many of whom have had their homes razed to the ground by dragon fire. Head due west from the Observatorium and seek out the carpenter who heads the rebuilding effort."
5,"TEXT_CLSHRV011_00013_SEQ_05","At Yannie's request, Fufucha journeyed to Coerthas to see with her own eyes the forest she helped grow, and the experience has opened her eyes. Return to the Botanists' Guild and speak with Fufucha."
6,"TEXT_CLSHRV011_00013_SEQ_06","Having finally come to peace with her role as a botanist in times of strife, Fufucha has decided to remain at the guild. She thanks you for helping her rediscover the sense of purpose she had lost, and applauds you as a model for all botanists to follow.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"
