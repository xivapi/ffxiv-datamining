1,"TEXT_SUBFST023_00098_SEQ_01","Dametta of Hyrstmill is making a batch of Mun–Tuy tonic, a nutritious but notoriously foul-tasting drink. If she could get her hands on some microchu leaflets to flavor the concoction, however, she could render it palatable for normal folk. Slay the microchus surrounding Hyrstmill and gather four leaflets from their remains."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST023_00098_SEQ_02","You've gathered four microchu leaflets. Deliver them to Dametta posthaste, before she makes some hapless soul drink the unadulterated brew!"
3,"TEXT_SUBFST023_00098_SEQ_03","To respect the forest and take only that which is needed, to lead a life without waste─such is the tenet by which Gridanians live. Dametta stresses the importance of this belief, before lamenting that her son has yet to take it to heart..."

I'll have you know I always drink at least one cup a day! Alas, few people share my <Emphasis>passion</Emphasis> for healthy living... Truth be told, most won't touch the stuff─not unless you add microchu leaflets, anyway. Apparently, the taste and the smell are too distracting or some such nonsense."
