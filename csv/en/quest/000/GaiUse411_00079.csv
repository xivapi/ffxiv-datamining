While he conducts a thorough search of the premises, speak with the Crystal Braves posted at Gridania's four main egresses─the Blue Badger Gate, the White Wolf Gate, the Yellow Serpent Gate, and Westshore Pier. If the flame marshal has left the city, one of them will surely have spotted her."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSE411_00079_ILBERD_000_002","Prior to joining the Immortal Flames, she was a mercenary of no small renown. They say her skill with a polearm had to be seen to be believed."
