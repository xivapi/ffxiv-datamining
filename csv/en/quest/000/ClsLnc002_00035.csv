1,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_SEQ_01","For your next trial, Ywain bids you obtain the Stone of Courage. It rests at the summit of Naked Rock, an anole-infested tor situated in the Central Shroud."
2,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_SEQ_02","After a grueling climb, you reach the summit of Naked Rock and gratefully claim the Stone of Courage. However, your moment of triumph is cut short by the appearance of the rogue lancer whom you encountered back at the guild. The sneering spearman, who introduces himself as Foulques, proceeds to declare your prize a counterfeit before challenging you to find the <Emphasis>true</Emphasis> stone, which he claims to have secreted in the depths of Spirithold. It would seem a trip to the abandoned dungeon is in order..."
3,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_SEQ_03","You have succeeded in obtaining the true Stone of Courage. Deliver it to Ywain, who awaits you back at the Lancers' Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_SEQ_04","Having listened intently to the tale of your meeting with Foulques, Ywain cautions you against paying the rogue lancer's words any heed. Contradicting Foulques's claim that courage can only be forged in the midst of great danger, the guildmaster reminds you that a lancer's courage is the product of composure and resolve. It is these qualities, and not blind daring, that he would have you keep in mind as you continue your training.

※The next lancer quest will be available from Ywain upon reaching level 15."

49,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_2","In our previous lesson, you learned the lancer's definition of courage, and how you might go about tempering its two aspects."
50,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_3","Today, we shall find out if your efforts have borne fruit."
51,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_4","I see you have come prepared for battle. That is well."
52,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_5","Your next trial will place you in the midst of a throng of enemies."
53,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_6","In such a situation, one may be attacked from any direction, making it difficult to respond appropriately. Furthermore, the likelihood of being surrounded is high."

55,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_8","Should you overcome this trial, what courage you already possess will be further tempered. Now heed me well, for this is what you must do."
56,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_9","I would have you travel to Naked Rock, where the anoles claim dominion. At the summit of the rock is a sacred artifact─the Stone of Courage. You must claim it, and bring it to me."
57,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_10","If you are to reach your destination, you will need to negotiate a path through whole packs of flesh-eating scalekin."

60,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_20","(-???-)Congratulations. You have obtained the false Stone of Courage."
61,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_21","(-???-)Aye, you heard me right─<Emphasis>false</Emphasis>. What does that say about your courage, I wonder?"
62,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_22","Ah, but where are my manners? My name is Foulques. We had the pleasure of meeting at the Lancers' Guild, if you recall."
63,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_23","On that occasion, I turned my weapon upon you, and you betrayed not a hint of fear. It was in that instant that I sensed you were unlike the others─that you had <Emphasis>promise</Emphasis>."
64,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_24","And so to the present... In its current state, the trial in which you are engaged─if “trial” it may be called─makes a mockery of the lancer's art. Needless to say, this cannot be tolerated."
65,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_25","And so I have taken the liberty of moving the Stone of Courage to a more suitable location. It now resides in the depths of Spirithold, under the guard of fell fiends. A far more fitting challenge, as I am sure you will agree."
66,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_26","Whether or not you attempt to retrieve the stone is for you to decide. If you fear for your safety, I suggest you run back to the guild and bemoan the world's frightfulness to the many brave souls who cower there. Ywain will doubtless consider it a supremely courageous act."
67,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_FOULQUES_000_27","Yet know that a lancer may forge true courage <Emphasis>only</Emphasis> in the midst of great danger."
68,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_TALK_SCENE00005_000","This isn't the text you're looking for."
69,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_30","So you have returned. Tell me, were you able to obtain the Stone of Courage?"
70,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_31","Yes, this is indeed the stone...though it is in rather worse condition than when last I saw it. What happened at Naked Rock?"
71,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_32","The lancer who but recently threatened you moved the stone to Spirithold!?"
72,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_33","Not content with trespass and slander, the brazen fool now meddles with our training!?"
73,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_34","Seven hells! This is not to be borne."
74,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_35","Listen well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Though I do not doubt that you know better, my duty as guildmaster compels me to state the obvious: heed not that man's words."
75,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_36","That a lancer's courage can only be forged in the midst of great danger is vainglorious tripe. As you have already learned, a lancer's courage is the product of composure and resolve."
76,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_37","Be under no misapprehension: watchfully navigating the anoles' territory served to temper your courage in a manner that blindly braving the terrors of Spirithold did not. As you continue your training, pray keep the lesson of this trial close to your heart."
77,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_38","Ah, before you return to your adventuring, there is one more thing I would tell you."
78,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_39","In recognition of your unwavering efforts in the trials thus far, I hereby grant you leave to join other guilds."
79,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_40","Naturally, you must seek the permission of the relevant guildmaster before commencing your training."
80,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_41","Gridania is home to a great many guilds besides our own. If you consider combat your calling, the archers and the conjurers have a strong presence in our nation. Should you crave a more peaceful pastime, you may alternatively consider joining the leatherworkers, carpenters, and botanists."
81,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_42","While there is something to be said for broadening one's horizons, it is also important to maintain focus. Always bear this in mind."
82,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_43","As your guildmaster, I would naturally prefer that you first master the lancers' art. Rest assured that there will be time enough to take up another discipline when you have done so."
83,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_YWAIN_000_44","Yet whatever path─or paths─you choose to walk, I look forward to seeing you realize your obvious potential."
84,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_SYSTEM_000_50","You now have access to the Armoury system. Quests to unlock the other classes can be undertaken by speaking to the receptionist in the corresponding guild."
85,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_SYSTEM_000_51","There exist myriad disciplines in Eorzea that adventurers can take up. For the most rewarding experience, however, it is recommended that you first focus on mastering your current class."
86,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_POP_MESSAGE","You sense a hostile presence!"
87,"TEXT_CLSLNC002_00035_ACCESS_MESSAGE","The enemy is still about!"
