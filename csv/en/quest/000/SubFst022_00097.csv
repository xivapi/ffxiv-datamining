1,"TEXT_SUBFST022_00097_SEQ_01","Eadbert asks you to investigate reports of Ixal sightings near the Hedgetree, southeast of Hyrstmill. If any harm were to come to the sacred tree, it would be a terrible tragedy."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST022_00097_SEQ_02","You are ambushed by an Ixal while investigating the Hedgetree. After a frenzied battle, you emerge victorious. Report back to Eadbert in Hyrstmill."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST022_00097_SEQ_03","Eadbert tells you that the Ixal once lived in the Twelveswood, but were driven out long ago, having incurred the wrath of the elementals. This, he explains, is the source of the beastmen's resentment for the Gridanians who now call the Twelveswood home."
