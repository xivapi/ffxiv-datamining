2,"TEXT_CLSCNJ002_00091_SEQ_02","Hearer Wulfiue has instructed you to exterminate a swarm of honeybees. Though the task's relevance is not immediately apparent, you have little alternative but to do as you are told. Head to the east of Sweetbloom Pier and investigate the spring."

4,"TEXT_CLSCNJ002_00091_SEQ_04","Wulfiue explains that the bees' presence was the result of a disturbance in the wind's natural currents. Return to the spring near Sweetbloom Pier, locate the source of the disturbance, and cleanse it with conjury."

7,"TEXT_CLSCNJ002_00091_SEQ_07","Back at the Conjurers' Guild, Brother E–Sumi–Yan expresses his pleasure at the fact that you have learned to hear the voice of the wind. Once again, however, your studies are interrupted by the young conjurer, Sylphie. As ever, she has no desire to deepen her understanding of nature, and refuses to heed his counsel. You, by contrast, take the Padjal's words to heart, and with the power of earth and wind at your command, continue your quest to master conjury.

※The next conjurer quest will be available from E–Sumi–Yan upon reaching level 15."
