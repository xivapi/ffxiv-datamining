1,"TEXT_GAIUSD501_00043_SEQ_01","You have scarcely exchanged two sentences with Urianger when Alisaie appears seeking the Archon's counsel on how to gain entry to the remaining internment hulks. Urianger suggests that she return to the connecting fragments of Dalamud in your company, in hopes that your presence will set events in motion, as it has so often in the past. In the meantime, the Archon promises to seek answers of his own. Make your way to the fragment situated at the Burning Wall in eastern Thanalan, and speak with Alisaie's assistant who has been reconnoitering the site."

Moments later, however, Urianger contacts you via linkpearl to notify you that he may have found a way to breach the remaining fragments. Make haste to the Ceruleum Processing Plant in northern Thanalan, where the Archon will furnish you with the details."

Meet her at the crystal formation known as Dalamud's Talons situated to the north of the plant."
