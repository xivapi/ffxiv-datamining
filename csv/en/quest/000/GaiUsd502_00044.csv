1,"TEXT_GAIUSD502_00044_SEQ_01","Having banished the elder primal Bahamut to the aether, you and the Leveilleur twins are transported back to Dalamud's Talons in northern Thanalan. Make your way to the Ceruleum Processing Plant, and report the mission's success to Urianger."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD502_00044_SEQ_02","If anything, Urianger seems more relieved at your safe return than glad of your victory─though it is indeed a proud achievement. Thanks to you, Bahamut is no more, and with all his worshipers eliminated, the primal shall never again return to threaten the realm. As Alphinaud and Urianger embark on their diplomatic mission to conceal the truth of the Calamity, Alisaie bids you accompany her to the Burning Wall in eastern Thanalan. Having offered a prayer to all those who lost their lives at the start of the Seventh Umbral Era, Alisaie declares that she will embark on a journey to find her own reason to fight for the realm. Inspired by your fine example, she pledges to help those in need, and grow stronger in so doing."
