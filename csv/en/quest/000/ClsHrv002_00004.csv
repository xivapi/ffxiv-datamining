1,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_SEQ_01","Fufucha has asked you to harvest ten pots of maple sap, which you must deliver to Cicely of the Botanists' Guild. Take yourself to Treespeak, where the sap can be found."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_SEQ_02","Cicely explains that the maple sap you collected will be used to make sweets for the many children orphaned by the Calamity. Upon hearing this, you cannot help but feel a sense of pride that your newly acquired skills have served such a good cause. Keep your nose to the grindstone, and ever more resources will be yours to gather.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 10."

49,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_FUFUCHA_000_2","Yet, as I mentioned before, hacking away at trees does not make you a botanist. You must also strive to deepen your understanding of nature."
50,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_FUFUCHA_000_3","I say this in the knowledge that you have done just that. Whether you realize it or not, you have the air of a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who is at ease with the world around <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>.

53,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_CICELY_000_10","On a quest for maple sap? Then your best bet is to search in the vicinity of Treespeak. I happen to be waiting for a delivery of sap myself. Might you be the botanist tasked with supplying it?"
54,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_CICELY_000_11","Ah, the maple sap I requested! Then you must be the new botanist Fufucha has been fussing over. Ah, but where are my manners? Thank you!"
55,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_CICELY_000_12","Hm? Why do I need so much of the stuff? Well, allow me to explain─it's the very least I can do, after all you've done."

57,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_CICELY_000_14","From maple syrup we can make maple sugar, an ingredient used in various recipes, particularly confectionery─from cakes and tarts to toffees and chocolates. In short, all the things that children love."

62,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_CICELY_000_19","In addition to maple sap, we botanists gather various other kinds of foodstuffs. As such, we work quite closely with culinarians, those Disciples of the Hand who excel at cooking. We're also on good terms with woodworkers and weavers, as both are reliant upon us to supply the lumber and fiber they need for their respective crafts."
63,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_CICELY_000_20","As botanists, it behooves us to learn what manner of materials are used in crafting, and there's no better way to do so than firsthand. If you have an interest, you might consider dabbling in one of the disciplines out there."
64,"TEXT_CLSHRV002_00004_CICELY_000_21","I also urge you to make a habit of reviewing the gathering log. As your knowledge of botany grows, more of its contents will become comprehensible to you."
