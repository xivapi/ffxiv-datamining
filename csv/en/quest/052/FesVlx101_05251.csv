※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_01","As you are taking in the romantic air of the Valentione's Day celebrations in Gridania, you come upon Astrid de Valentione, the head emissary of ardor and affection. She wastes no time recruiting your aid in assisting a botanist named Laurovic, who has provided the roses which are being distributed for the festivities, but is experiencing difficulties of his own in love. To that end do you make your way to the Greatloam Growery, there to learn from the man the details of his dilemma.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_02","Speaking with Laurovic, you learn that he seeks to be reunited with his love, an Ishgardian botanist named Sylginie, who had left without a word. The roses being given out were grown from the seeds she had entrusted to him, in hopes that she might be compelled to return to Gridania to see them. And though return she has, she soon vanished again amidst the throng, and Laurovic bids you help him to find her. So it is that you set forth in search of a silver-haired Elezen maiden wearing a rose earring."
3,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_03","After a search in the city, you succeed in locating Sylginie. While she admits that she still loves Laurovic, for reasons she does not disclose, she says that she is too ashamed to meet him, and asks that he be told to forget her."
4,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_04","You break the bad tidings to Laurovic, who struggles to come to terms with Sylginie's request. It is then that Ser Titouan, a knight of House Haillenarte, announces himself. It transpires that the roses used in the celebration are the Driancoin, a prized variety that withered in the freeze that descended upon Coerthas following the Calamity. When this happened, it was believed that Sylginie, who had tended the Haillenarte rose gardens, fled for the shame, and it is to ascertain the truth of the matter that Ser Titouan has come to Gridania. Refusing to give up on his love, Laurovic asks for permission to search with the knight, who proposes spreading a rumor to draw out Sylginie. Your course of action thus decided, the three of you split up to recruit citizens to your cause."
5,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_05","You approach a number of citizens, all of whom are more than willing to do their part for love. Your task satisfactorily accomplished, you make your way to the Greatloam Growery to rejoin your companions in anticipation of Sylginie's appearance."
6,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_06","The ruse goes as planned, with Sylginie soon arriving out of concern for Laurovic, who apologizes for his deception before asking her why she left the Driancoin seeds with him before vanishing. As you and Titouan watch on, Sylginie explains that she wished only to save the rose, but having failed her house as well as violated its rules, she felt that she did not deserve to be happy. Laurovic vehemently disagrees, and proffering a bouquet on one knee, he begs her to remain and grow roses with him. In turn, Ser Titouan gives his assurance that Sylginie will not be punished, and after a moment's silence, she finally allows herself to smile as she accepts Laurovic's heartfelt invitation."
7,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_07","Laurovic thanks you and Ser Titouan for helping him and Sylginie to be reunited. After the knight takes his leave, the couple set off to report the happy tidings to Astrid at the amphitheatre, and you are asked to accompany them."
8,"TEXT_FESVLX101_05251_SEQ_08","Astrid rejoices at the blissful end to Laurovic and Sylginie's tale, and expresses her delight that the Driancoin should reunite those who grew them. The rose will doubtless continue to help people to convey the depths of their hearts, during this Valentione's Day and the days beyond."
