※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESNYX202_05230_SEQ_01","The Heavensturn procession will soon commence outside the Zephyr Gate. The uma bugyo cordially invites you to attend, to which end you make your way to middle La Noscea, where the uma yoriki awaits.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESNYX202_05230_SEQ_02","Shortly after you join the uma yoriki, riders from the three Grand Companies arrive with their horses to participate in the procession. When the unicolt expresses its desire to join in, the uma yoriki relents on the condition that you will be accompanying it. The main procession then departs, leaving you to make your way to the destination with the unicolt.

There, it is warmly received by the uma yoriki and Grand Company riders, who muse about the common ground Eorzea and the Far East share in the unicorn. Your part in the festivities thus completed, you make your way back to the Aftcastle to report to the uma bugyo."
6,"TEXT_FESNYX202_05230_SEQ_06","In no small part due to your assistance, the procession has fulfilled its intended purpose and more besides. Noticing the bond you have developed with the unicolt, the uma bugyo bids you take it with you. Together with your small-but-spirited companion, you look forward to the journeys in the year ahead."
