1,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_01","Briardien has a hunch that the missing volume eleven of the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis> and Ulaa's sudden withdrawal are somehow connected, and decides to find the girl to ask her what─or who caused her to change her mind. In the meantime, Saturnois has asked to meet with you in private in the plaza next to Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral."
2,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_02","At the plaza, Saturnois introduces Theomocent and Leigh as the students whom he is counseling to obtain Trinity seats. He also expresses his concerns about Archombadin and Lebrassoir, and their blatant discrimination of lowborn peers. In their pursuit to prove their virtue, Theomocent and Leigh discuss finding like-minded individuals with whom they could ally, and Crammevoix is mentioned as a possible candidate. As Leigh is unenthusiastic in approaching any of the highborn, Saturnois asks you to accompany Theomocent to the Pillars to find Crammevoix."
3,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_03","While Theomocent tries his best to persuade Crammevoix to join his cause, it would appear that his timing is unfortunate as the suave seminarian is preoccupied with a beautiful young woman who had been vying for his attention. Laughing at Theomocent's cluelessness in the situation, the highborn student attempts to brush aside his resolve, and leaves elsewhere with the lady. But Theomocent refuses to give up just yet, and urges you to follow him to Foundation."
4,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_04","Unexpectedly, Theomocent discovers Crammevoix tied up by his now knife-wielding lady friend. Despite his peril, he warns the timid seminarian not to interfere with his house's affairs, explaining that the woman is one of the smallfolk of his lands, who has rightfully come to seek recompense for his father's sins; he assumes he will most likely pay with his life, as his father had. Theomocent emotionally objects, and tries to convince the woman to accept coin instead of committing a sin herself. He then offers to exchange his life until Crammevoix can return, a gesture that the highborn is moved by."
5,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_05","Trusting that Crammevoix will pay her his house's fortune, the woman reluctantly exchanges her prisoner, with Theomocent bound in his stead. Crammevoix promises to return soon after retrieving the coffer from its hidden place in Coerthas. With Theomocent assuring you he will be fine, Crammevoix asks you to accompany him to ensure bandits do not ambush him on the way back. Make haste to western Coerthas, before the knife-wielding woman loses her patience."
6,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_06","You join Crammevoix in the western highlands, and he asks you to stand watch while he retrieves the family fortune. Ensure nothing will catch him unawares."
7,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_07","As you wait for Crammevoix to search for the coffer, a group of hungry archaeornis seemingly appears out of nowhere. You dispatch the beasts and continue your watch."
8,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_08","After what felt like an eternity, Crammevoix finally produces his family's fortune. He bids you both return to Ishgard, and hopes that Theomocent is still alive and well."
9,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_09","Satisfied with the amount of monetary compensation for the war dead, the woman leaves without a word. Leigh and Saturnois arrive moments later, and Crammevoix reveals to all his father's sin; that he sought honor with the Holy See, and bought it with the blood of the smallfolk and eventually his own. After being left adrift in Ishgard since the murders of his family, Crammevoix is inspired by Theomocent's will to leave the sins of the past behind, declaring himself a friend and ally in their cause. Meanwhile, Saturnois tells you that Briardien has been waiting for you at the cathedral with some new information."
10,"TEXT_CHREND104_02155_SEQ_10","You meet with Briardien, who tells you some concerning news about his investigation. Looking to inquire of Ulaa as to why she felt compelled to leave the scholasticate, he discovers that the girl has vanished altogether. Along with the missing volume eleven, Briardien comments that someone may indeed be trying to turn the situation to their advantage, and your duty as inspectors is to seek out the malicious forces at work."
