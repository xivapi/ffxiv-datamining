※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN302_02186_SEQ_01","According to Muna Vanu, their resident hut builder, Ginu Vanu, is in need of assistance to continue his work. Speak with him to see what you can do to help.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANVAN302_02186_SEQ_02","Ginu Vanu feels that his work so far is too plain. He insists that Ok' Gundu Nakki needs something unique to set it apart from other settlements, and he has a plan to make it happen. For his idea to work, however, he needs special stones taken from the living masses of rock known as groundsreapers. He asks that you travel to the eastern region of the Blue Window and slay them for building material."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN302_02186_SEQ_03","You make swift work of two groundsreapers and retrieve a golem wart from each. Take them to Ginu Vanu, and see if they suit his needs."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN302_02186_SEQ_04","Ginu Vanu is thrilled to see you have brought him material in near-perfect condition. As he tells it, the groundsreapers, birthed from the soil of islands, sustain themselves using rain and other rocks for sustenance. With building blocks that can essentially feed on bad weather, Ginu Vanu is all but certain the next hut he builds will be the envy of all Vanu villages."

55,"TEXT_BANVAN302_02186_GINUVANU_000_023","Netherling brings stones from very young groundsreapers. They hold firm against wind and drink rain to stay strong. Where storm would damage normal hut, this hut grows like tree basking in sunlight."
