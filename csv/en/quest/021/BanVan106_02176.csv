※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN106_02176_SEQ_01","You learn that the Gundu's water supplies are precariously close to running out. Muna Vanu is not content to gamble his tribe's fate on waiting for rain, and so asks you to collect spring crystals from Voor Sian Siran to fulfill the need for water. However, since the knights of Camp Cloudtop now gather crystals there, he suggests you seek authorization from the nearby Ishgardians, lest a diplomatic incident result. Travel to the Rosehouse and convince Lady Laniaitte to let you harvest these crystals.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANVAN106_02176_SEQ_02","Laniaitte is more than happy for you to gather spring crystals for the Gundu. In fact, she finds it odd that they even feel they need permission. Collect three spring crystals from Voor Sian Siran, then return to Muna Vanu and let him know that the Rose Knights bear his people no ill will."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN106_02176_SEQ_03","You collect three large, clean spring crystals. Deliver them to Muna Vanu."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN106_02176_SEQ_04","With the crystals you gathered for them, the Gundu tribe will now have enough water to meet their needs. Though they wish to foster a mutually beneficial relationship with the knights of Camp Cloudtop, troubles with the Vundu have left them too busy to work towards this goal. But by speaking to the Ishgardians on their behalf, you may have paved the way to further advancements on this front."

Rainfall is rare thing when above clouds themselves, but spring crystals well with moisture, pouring forth like endless waterfall. Such crystals would quench our tribe's thirst."
49,"TEXT_BANVAN106_02176_MUNAVANU_000_001","They grow large at place netherlings call Voor Sian Siran. Knights of Camp Cloudtop use spring crystals as water source, as once did Gundu, but to harvest them without permission would risk sparking hostilities."

57,"TEXT_BANVAN106_02176_MUNAVANU_000_042","To gather water in Sea of Clouds is no easy task. Gundu collect rainwater, but sky is fickle with its generosity. And so we must resort to spring crystals."
