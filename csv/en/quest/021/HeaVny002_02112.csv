Complicating matters is the fact that the waukkeon, the giant breed of sanuwa from which the masks are fashioned, resides only on Neverreap, the sacred island which has been seized by the Vundu. Make your way outside the village and speak with Tonu Vanu, who will serve as your guide."

He gives you his gratitude, expressing a hope that netherlings and the Zundu can continue to live in friendship and harmony for years to come."
