1,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_SEQ_01","Torsefers informs you that a mysterious stranger came calling during your absence. If you would oblige his request to meet, make your way to the Rising Stones and seek him out in the solar."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_SEQ_02","Arriving in the solar of the Rising Stones, you are greeted by a masked boy, who introduces himself as Unukalhai. He proceeds to alert you to the rising threat of beings known as eikons, which he clarifies are not the primals you know so well. Rather, the term “eikon” and the beings to which it refers date back to the days of the Allagan Empire. At this juncture, Urianger makes an unannounced appearance and takes over the explanation. It appears that the Warring Triad, three eikons sealed within the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla, are threatening to break free. To compound matters, the primals you had but recently defeated have also been resummoned. While Urianger considers measures, you must attend to the task of vanquishing the primals, lest they seek to seize the power of the slumbering eikons and hasten their awakening. Unukalhai will assist you in this endeavor, though his allegiance and motive yet remain a mystery."

59,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_URIANGER_000_015","As the Warrior of Light's comrade, my participation is but to be expected. After all, the matter doth pertain to the very fate of this star."

61,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_UNUKALHAI_000_017","And it did not end with capture, as you well know, for the Allagans also learned how to harness the eikons' power."
62,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_UNUKALHAI_100_017","They refined this knowledge at the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla. And within the Centrifugal Crystal Engine, they sealed three of the beings─the Warring Triad."

70,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_UNUKALHAI_500_024","If left unchecked, they will inevitably seek to seize the power of the Warring Triad. This will serve to feed the confluence of chaos and hasten the eikons' awakening."
71,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_URIANGER_000_025","To wit, we must needs vanquish both their kinds. I pray thee, however, to first focus thy gaze upon the primals, ere we turn our attention to those eikons and their fitful slumber..."
72,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_URIANGER_100_025","I shall return to the Waking Sands forthwith and consider such measures as are available to us."
73,"TEXT_HEAVNY201_02114_URIANGER_000_026","Meanwhile, I bid thee attend to the task of eliminating the primals. Young Unukalhai shall assist thee. Rest assured he is not our enemy. For the time being, at least."
