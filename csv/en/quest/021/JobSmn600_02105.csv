1,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_SEQ_01","Y'mhitra has been pondering the retreat of the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice, and shares her conclusions concerning your foe and his black-masked brethren. Theorizing that the lower-ranked Paragon is unable to possess a living being, the researcher suggests luring the villain to an unpopulated area and destroying him for good with a devastating coup de grâce. First, however, you will need to acquire a certain forbidden tome, and study the method by which the power of a trance can be unleashed in one mighty blast. Travel to the Great Gubal Library in the Dravanian hinterlands, and rendezvous with your companions."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_SEQ_02","As you prepare to enter the Great Gubal Library, you are accosted by the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice and three of his fellows. The servants of Lahabrea pronounce your demise, and furious battle is joined. Following a murderous exchange of arcane energies, you at last stand victorious over the kneeling form of your foe. The humbled Paragon once more attempts to flee, but you focus the energy of your trance and obliterate the villain with a searing flare of destructive power. Speak with Dancing Wolf, and share this triumph with your companions."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_SEQ_03","Though still somewhat stunned by your display of power, Dancing Wolf at last feels that vengeance has been claimed for his wronged soldiers. The captain then praises Y'mhitra for her clever deceit, and thanks you both for your invaluable assistance in bringing the Ascian to justice before setting out on the road back to Ul'dah. Speak now with Y'mhitra, and discuss the future of summoning."
4,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_SEQ_04","With the defeat of the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice, Y'mhitra believes that the reputation of the summoning arts has been spared an ignominious fate. She is, however, yet greatly concerned by the escalating threat of the primals. Though the perfect solution remains elusive, continue to work alongside the determined researcher in the quest to bring an end to the self-perpetuating cycle of violence.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"

52,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_YMHITRA_000_004","But once <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> had acquired the Dreadwyrm Trance, the haste with which the Ascian withdrew did not seem to me the action of a being who harbors no fear of death."
53,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_YMHITRA_000_005","Thus do I pose the question: could it be that the Twelfth Chalice and his black-masked brethren are not as practiced in the art of possession as their red-veiled masters?"
54,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_YMHITRA_000_006","At the time of the battle, our bodies were the only available hosts nearby.

83,"TEXT_JOBSMN600_02105_YMHITRA_000_133","Ahahaha! My apologies, Captain. But in order to deceive one's enemies, 'tis best to begin with one's friends. There was never any such book.
