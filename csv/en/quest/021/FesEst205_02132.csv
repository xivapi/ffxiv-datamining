※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_SEQ_01","Nonotta informs you that while the festival is going splendidly, the Hatching Hour has yet to arrive. Puzzled as to why there has been no sign of the Archons' gift and noting Jihli's somewhat disappointed expression, she requests that you ask the Hatching–tide founder if there were any details of the dream that she forgot to mention.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_SEQ_02","Like her assistant, Jihli cannot help but wonder what could be missing from the festival, until Nonotta rushes over and exclaims that the egg chosen for the Hatching Ceremony has been stolen by a spriggan. Though annoyed at first, Jihli has a sudden revelation: the egg hunt in her dream was for a single egg. Excited, she declares that the true hunt has begun, and asks you to help her find the thieving spriggan."
3,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_SEQ_03","The gatekeeper of the Blue Badger Gate in New Gridania tells you that he did indeed let a lone spriggan through, thinking that it was taking Hatching–tide decorations to Bentbranch. Hurry back to Old Gridania and tell Jihli where the spriggan is headed."
4,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_SEQ_04","Jihli implores you to give chase and states that she will join you after she instructs the Dreamers to assemble and prepare for the ceremony at the amphitheatre. Make for Bentbranch Meadows."
5,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_SEQ_05","In Bentbranch Meadows, Keitha confirms that a spriggan passed by, struggling to carry an enormous egg, which he then laid carefully in the stables before taking a long nap and departing the Shroud. Jihli beseeches Keitha to return the egg, explaining the importance of decorating and displaying it for Hatching–tide. The head wrangler refuses, however, asserting that chocobo eggs are extremely delicate─a statement which surprises and confuses the two Dreamers. Recalling the unusual size and warmth of that egg, Nonotta realizes her mistake and apologizes. Keitha then invites everyone to witness the hatching for themselves, and afterwards, as the two Dreamers fuss over the newborn baby chocobo, Jihli has another epiphany: the gold-colored feathers of the bird must have been the “golden treasure” of which she dreamt. While not entirely accurate (and lacking the proper audience she envisioned), both Jihli and Nonotta concur that the prophecy has been fulfilled, bringing them one step closer to the Archons' descent. With the Hatching Hour complete, Jihli declares the Archons' message cause to rejoice, and returns to Gridania to continue the celebration."

50,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_NONOTTA_000_002","What could be amiss? All of the elements seem to be in place. But I'd rather not press her about it. Maybe you can ask her if there is anything else she forgot to mention?"
51,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_NONOTTA_000_003","Perhaps this outfit is not the right shade of pink. Or that spriggan's fur was not properly combed. Or that balloon is floating at the wrong height."

54,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_NONOTTA_000_012","Jihli! A spriggan from the scramble has pilfered the chosen egg! The one that was to be used in the Hatching Ceremony!"

59,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_017","I shall stay here and speak with Black Rabbit Traders and my fellow Dreamers. Surely someone else saw the spriggan wander off."
60,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_NONOTTA_000_018","Oh, I knew I should have kept a closer eye on the scramble game! If that spriggan runs away with the chosen egg, all my dreams of gold and riches will be for nothing!"
61,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_BERNADETTE_000_020","Come to think of it, I did see a spriggan carry a large white egg through here. I thought the little creature was delivering it to the Carline Canopy. Until he passed it, that is."
62,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_BERTENNANT_000_021","Aye, I let him through the gate. He seemed quite rushed, even for a spriggan. He was taking decorations to Bentbranch for that festival, I imagine?"
63,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_STOUTELM_000_022","A spriggan carryin' an egg? Were it any other time I'd say you were in your cups, but Old Gridania's crawlin' with the little buggers right now. None that stand out as particularly strikin' though, no. "
64,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_BERNADETTE_000_023","If it wasn't meant for a banquet at the Canopy, then I suppose it was not a real egg. Pity, that. It looked as if though it could make an omelette large enough to feed ten people."
65,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_BERTENNANT_000_024","Why didn't I go after it? I have orders to bar suspicious and dangerous-looking sorts, and he was neither. Besides, I've seen stranger things pass through this gate."

71,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_NONOTTA_000_034","Selfish, greedy spriggan! I'd string him up by his ears if I wasn't so sure he would bite my fingers off first."
72,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_KEITHA_000_040","Aye, a spriggan did come by. We were quite surprised at the size of the egg he was holdin' in his little paws."
73,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_KEITHA_000_041","Poor thing looked as if he was carryin' it for malms. He was pantin' somethin' fierce by the time he reached the stables. Took a nap and went on his merry way, he did."
74,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_042","Miss Keitha, that egg is the key to fulfilling an important prophecy. It is the centerpiece of our festival, and it needs to be painted and decorated before the Hatching Hour. May we have it back?"
75,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_KEITHA_000_043","Paint and decorate it, are you mad!? Chocobo eggs are extremely delicate!"
76,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_044","A chocobo egg!?"
77,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_NONOTTA_000_045","Oh dear, it must have gotten mixed up with all of the plaster eggs. It certainly felt warmer than the others, but I thought that was just part of the prophecy. I'm terribly sorry!"
78,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_KEITHA_000_046","Well, the egg's in good hands now and that's all that matters. Can't say I know what this “Hatchin' Hour” business is about, but the egg's due for its own soon. I can take you to the stables to see, if you promise not to do anythin'...strange."
79,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_KEITHA_100_046","'Twas mere luck that spriggans are greedy enough to clutch things so close to their bodies. If the egg ain't kept warm enough, the last few days can mean life or death."
80,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_KEITHA_110_046","You hear that? Well, little one, time to come out!"
81,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_047","Oh, isn't it adorable? What beautiful feathers!"
82,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_048","Beautiful <Emphasis>gold</Emphasis> feathers! Just like the prophecy! At the Hatching Hour, the Twelve Archons bestowed upon the crowd a shining golden treasure!"
83,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_NONOTTA_100_048","Wow, Jihli, you've done it again! Although it's not exactly shining. And the crowd is somewhat small. Even so, I suppose having a close-up of this miracle is also a treat."
84,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_JIHLIALIAPOH_100_049","Miss Keitha, I apologize for the earlier confusion. Amidst our zeal, we seemed to have overlooked the finer details. We are truly grateful to have witnessed this gift we have been given."
85,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_049","And with that, the prophecy has been fulfilled! ...More or less. While we cannot share this treasure with the others, it is undeniable that we have witnessed a blessing of the Twelve Archons. Let us return to Gridania, and continue with the festivities! "

87,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_GYSOL_000_051","It is you! Do you remember me? It's Gysol...like the gysahl green. We met at Tailfeather some time ago. I decided to come here for a spell to learn chocobo husbandry."
88,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_GYSOL_000_052","The hunters seemed supportive of my decision; Loupard even helped arrange for my journey here. And Q'yantaa, well...we agreed it would be for the best. So, how was it? The chocobo hatching."
89,"TEXT_FESEST205_02132_GYSOL_000_053","Incredible, isn't it? I'm always thrilled to see a hatching. Keitha says this little one will be mine to watch over. And this time, I won't let him leave my sight until he's a strong, beautiful bird. I promise!"
