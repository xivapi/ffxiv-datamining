※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN004_02167_SEQ_01","Linu Vali can barely contain her excitement when she tells you that a captured Vundu spy has given up information about her brother. According to the spy, Linu Vanu has been moved to a skycage hanging from the Cromlech. Adamant not to miss this long-awaited chance, she rushes off without further explanation. Meet Linu Vali at the Cromlech to aid in the rescue of her brother.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANVAN004_02167_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Cromlech to find Linu Vali surrounded by Vundu, ready to attack after Linu Vali's ineffectual sundrop dance. Luckily, you dispatch them before any of the petals on Linu Vali's head come to harm. Speak with Linu Vali, who looks eager to get on with her brother's rescue."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN004_02167_SEQ_03","It seems the Vundu were lying in wait for any Vanu bold enough to try and rescue Linu Vali's brother. Your skirmish allows a brief window of safety, and Linu Vali asks you to give her brother a sanuwa horn, which he may use to summon a sanuwa and fly to safety. Find the skycage holding her brother and pass him the horn."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN004_02167_SEQ_04","After searching the skycages below, you come across a confused Linu Vanu. After you explain the situation to him, he eagerly accepts the sanuwa horn his sister gave you and uses it to summon a sanuwa to escape the stuffy skycage. He dismounts to greet his sister as she is being confronted by yet another group of Vundu warriors. The two share a knowing glance before starting a perfectly synced sundrop dance, the intensity of which sends the Vundu scurrying back to their roosts. The two siblings are safe to have their heartfelt reunion at last, and Linu Vali explains everything that has happened thus far with the Gundu refugees. Her brother seems somewhat skeptical as to the intent of the Zundu tribe's newfound generosity, but nonetheless agrees to visit Ok' Zundu and greet Sonu Vanu. Follow the siblings back to Ok' Zundu and take part in the greeting."
5,"TEXT_BANVAN004_02167_SEQ_05","Linu Vali is eager to introduce her brother to the Ok' Zundu chieftain, who affably greets the pair. Linu Vanu comments that Ok' Zundu has been left relatively untouched by the Vundu, and criticizes the Ok' Zundu chieftain for buying his tribe's safety with tributes while others, namely the Gundu, had their homes destroyed. Linu Vali is quick to silence her brother, explaining to him that if not for the Zundu, their tribe would be in an even worse off position. Her brother is surprised at his sister's boldness, and he apologizes for his actions. Sonu Vanu takes Linu Vanu's affront in stride, saying that he wants only for the two tribes to grow closer. The Gundu siblings depart to Ok' Gundu Nakki. Return with them and speak with Linu Vali upon your arrival."
6,"TEXT_BANVAN004_02167_SEQ_06","Linu Vanu is appointed chief of Ok' Gundu Nakki, and the village finally has a leader. Linu Vali is relieved that the responsibility of leadership has been passed to her brother, but is worried that their recent meeting with the Zundu may cause trouble between the two tribes further down the road. She has a plan to improve the relations between Zundu and Gundu, and asks that you prepare to lend your aid when she is ready."
