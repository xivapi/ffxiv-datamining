※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST201_02128_SEQ_01","Jihli joyfully fills you in on a dream she had, which she believes to be a vision sent from the Twelve Archons, past heroes of legend. The mirthful Miqo'te dreamt of a scene of revelry with Eorzeans from all over gathering in Gridania to participate in an egg hunt and other festivities. Although the dream grew too bright to see it herself, she recalls with confidence that at the height of the celebration, the so-called Hatching Hour, a chosen egg cracked to reveal a gold treasure. Believing this to be a message sent from the heavens to herald the Archons' forthcoming descent, Jihli asks you to help her recreate the scene in her dream, promising to share the prophesized wealth with you should you succeed. Speak to Nonotta to learn how you can participate.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST201_02128_SEQ_02","Nonotta provides you with more details about how to successfully recreate Jihli's vision in order for the golden treasure to appear. She explains that the Dreamers, along with Black Rabbit Traders of Gridania, have set up three Hatching-tide activities for the realm to enjoy. Once you have completed each activity at least once, she asks you check with her to see if they are any closer to the Hatching Hour."

Thus the Dreamers and I have spent day after day continuing to paint, dye, and etch the finest vessels for the Archons, all of which you see before you."

Well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I spend my days spreading the news of Hatching–tide! How did this fascination with eggs come about, you ask? Well, it started with a dream; although I was quite literally asleep!"

They descended from the heavens upon beautiful decorated eggs and delivered unto me a message: to prepare like carriages for their return to Eorzea. Along with my fellow believers, the Dreamers, I have dedicated my life to this pursuit!"

And at the height of the festivities, the Hatching Hour came and a chosen egg cracked, revealing unto us the miracle."

By sharing this treasure with all who believe, surely the Archons will be pleased, thus encouraging their triumphant return."
56,"TEXT_FESEST201_02128_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_008","You will help us, won't you? If you do, I promise you will not leave empty-handed, for the Archons' treasure is for all to share. Speak to my good friend, Nonotta, and she can give you more details on how to participate."
