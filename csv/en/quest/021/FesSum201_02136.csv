※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_SEQ_01","When balloons of every color fill the sky and the people don yukatas to endure the summer heat, Eorzeans across the realm know the season of the Moonfire Faire is upon them once more. The excitement in the air is tangible, but none are more enthusiastic about the festivities than the faire chaperone Mayaru Moyaru, who approaches you with an offer. He tells you that in exchange for your assistance, you will be given special rewards. Sensing your interest has been piqued, he bids you to go and speak with Haermaga, the grand chaperone of this year's event, for details.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_SEQ_02","Haermaga tells you that the Bombard King has risen again and that he and a few members from the Adventurers' Guild intend to put an end to his reign before it can begin. At first, he asks that you support them by exterminating some of the minions that have accompanied their king to Costa del Sol, but then in hushed tones, he bids you meet him by the waterfall in a quarter bell that he might explain to you a top secret mission, only meant for your ears."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_SEQ_03","A trio of masked Rangers clad in red, black, and yellow appears before you. After a few bold introductions, they explain to you that while their powers, when combined in the Firefall Battle Formation, are strong enough to take down the Bombard King, it is something they cannot pull off with any measure of consistency. To improve their success rate, they turn to you, asking that you help them with their training. Report to Haermaga should you be interested in offering your assistance."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_SEQ_04","Haermaga is delighted to hear you are willing to help the Go Go Posing Rangers with their training. He would like you to begin working with the Red Ranger straightaway and refers you to J'nangho, who will fill you in on the details."

49,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_MAYARUMOYARU_000_001","Wait a second... You look mighty familiar. Yes, yes! I remember now─you're the strapping young <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> from several summers ago. I didn't expect to see you here, but I suppose even adventurers need to forget the summer heat with a bit of celebration!"
50,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_MAYARUMOYARU_000_002","Ah, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>! You can't mean to say you don't know what the Moonfire Faire is!? I've never been much of a storyteller─forget half the details and muddle everything up─but our Moonfire criers have quite the knack for it!"

56,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_012","Now, as you've no doubt noticed, the heat this year has been nigh unbearable! And even though we should've seen the worst, temperatures continue to soar─a phenomenon eerily reminiscent of the events of five years past, wouldn't you say?"
57,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_013","Aye, I fear that the Bombard King has returned to plague these lands, and with power even greater than before at his disposal."
58,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_014","He has been most frequently spotted along the shores of Costa del Sol, so to keep an eye on him, we have decided to host the annual festivities here."
59,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_015","So far, he has been laying low─only surfacing to terrorize the occasional passerby. However, it is only a matter of time before he grows bold enough to venture further inland."
60,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_016","As proud members of the Adventurers' Guild, we must do our utmost to prevent this from happening. To that end, some of us have formed an...er, organization of sorts."
61,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_017","But we'll come to that later. Ahem! With our heat-resistant Cascadier armor and the tactical knowledge we have gained through our studies, the fiend─and his tiny minions─won't stand a chance!"
62,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_018","Of course, we would feel much more confident were we to have your help, perhaps with the extermination of those smaller Bombards."
63,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_019","We've found the waters of the elbst are most effective at extinguishing their flames. If you speak with Wunthyll, our stockman, he'll see you paired with one of our finest beasts."
64,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_020","...There is, however, something else I would ask of you. This is a matter requiring the utmost discretion, so I would prefer we continue this discussion in a more private setting. Pray meet me by the waterfall in a quarter bell."
65,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_029","Do you not know where it is? If you follow the coastline, you'll come across a hidden cove. Just beyond that is the waterfall I speak of. Even from a distance you should be able to hear the rushing waters!"
66,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_030","(-???-)In times of desperate need, we hope for a hero. We look to the heavens and pray that someone, somewhere, is watching over us. Well, my friend, you need look no further!"
67,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_031","(-???-)The Go Go Posing Rangers are here, and we implore you, Warrior of Light, to stand with us against the blazing summer heat!"

74,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_042","Indeed, she is right. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I'm sorry to say we cannot reveal to you our true identities. To do so would be akin to breaking the oath we took as Rangers, for we fight solely to protect the people─not for personal glory!"
75,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_BEAUDEFOIN_000_043","Hear, hear! Humble guardians risking their lives to ensure the peace and prosperity of the realm─a beautiful and pure gesture, much like my twin-slash attack, which transcends even the might of our Firefall Battle Forma─"
76,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HILDELANA_000_044","Hold it right there, Yellow Ranger! Didn't we agree we would make no mention of the formation until we determined that our companion is as trustworthy as Haermaga says?"
77,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_045","Come now, Black Ranger! I can assure you that few are as honorable as the Warrior of Light! In fact, I think it should greatly benefit our cause to divulge to <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> all of the circumstances surrounding our current mission."
78,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_BEAUDEFOIN_000_046","Hah! And as the Go Go Posing Rangers' premier member, I suppose explaining exactly what that entails falls to me. Before we begin, however, I ask that none of you interrupts. Ahem. Are we clear, Hil─er, Black Ranger?"
79,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_BEAUDEFOIN_000_047","Let me start at the beginning. There are <Emphasis>two</Emphasis> reasons as to why the Go Go Posing Rangers are Eorzea's best bet at beating back the Bombards. First, because we have this smashing Cascadier armor. Second, because my prowess on the battlefield, with these two providing support, is unpara─"
80,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HILDELANA_000_048","Our <Emphasis>combined</Emphasis> strength is indeed formidable but only when we manage to coordinate our attacks. The Firefall Battle Formation, however, is something we've successfully executed only a handful of times..."
81,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_049","Yes. It's humiliating to even think about! We formed the Go Go Posing Rangers so that we might protect the land and its people from the Bombards, but the truth is, most of the time we cannot even protect ourselves..."
82,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HILDELANA_000_050","To remedy this, each of us has prepared a specialized training regimen. We ask that <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>─as a realm-renowned adventurer of surpassing skill─help us train to the best of our ability."
83,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_051","You are, by all means, free to decline. I would only ask you keep all we revealed today a closely guarded secret. Were the people to learn the men destined to defeat the Bombard King are still undergoing training, it might incite panic. And with that, we shall take our leave and humbly await your reply. Rangers, out!"
84,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_BEAUDEFOIN_000_052","The old boy needs to learn to lighten up! As our official leader, Red tends to think he bears the responsibility of defeating the Bombards alone. He forgets one very important thing, however─he has the unstoppable Yellow Ranger at his side!"
85,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HILDELANA_000_053","...That's likely what worries him most. If your mindless drivel isn't what kills us, that inflated ego of yours is certain to do the job!"
86,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HILDELANA_000_054","<sigh> All joking aside, I sincerely hope we can count on your support. It's going to take a miracle to pull this off, but somehow I believe, with you on our side, we can make it happen!"
87,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_060","You'll do it!? I knew I asked the right <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>! The Red Ranger is eager to begin his training straightaway, so I ask you start by assisting him as soon as you are able. My assistant, J'nangho, will explain the details to you."
88,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_061","As I am sure the Rangers mentioned, this is a <Emphasis>covert</Emphasis> operation, and its success requires your discretion."
89,"TEXT_FESSUM201_02136_HAERMAGA_000_062","That being said, we could not have asked for a more steadfast ally. The future is bright, my friend! Between you, me, and the Posing Rangers, I have faith we can see to a better tomorrow! Go Go Posing Rangers!"
