Participate in the FATE “Recurring Bugs” taking place northwest of Black Brush Station in central Thanalan, or in Nophica's Wells in western Thanalan.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."

3,"TEXT_FESANV101_02134_SEQ_03","You relay your victory to an appreciative Nonora, but the wandering minstrel is swift to put your achievement into perspective─unless a permanent solution is found, the bugs will continue to proliferate. Take the bug scrap you discovered to the wandering composer nearby, and ask him for his interpretation of the strange sound the object emits."
4,"TEXT_FESANV101_02134_SEQ_04","The itinerant composer discerns a definite rhythm and melody amid the noise, and notes a sequence of unfamiliar symbols on the scrap which seem to change in time to the sound.

5,"TEXT_FESANV101_02134_SEQ_05","After peering intently at the symbols on the scrap, the translator deciphers two distinct themes: “proliferation” and “command.” Unsure of the significance of these words, however, he recommends you speak with yet another visitor to Ul'dah whose eclectic knowledge of ancient civilizations may hold the answers you seek. Find the wandering author and request his assistance."
6,"TEXT_FESANV101_02134_SEQ_06","You recount your predicament to the visiting author who is reminded of a passage he came across while researching for a novella set in ancient Allag.

7,"TEXT_FESANV101_02134_SEQ_07","After explaining the purpose of the signal emitted by the scrap, the engineer reasons that playing a specific melody upon the bugs' defeat could interfere with the replication command.

8,"TEXT_FESANV101_02134_SEQ_08","You hand the engineer's report to the waiting minstrel, and share with him the rest of your findings. Inspired by the talented souls that jointly crafted a solution to the bug problem, he feels moved to compose an ode on the spot.

Before you can ask how he and his colleagues came to hear of your tale, you awaken in Ul'dah as if nothing had happened. Unperturbed, you resolve to enjoy the festivities and evening fireworks alongside Nonora and the wandering minstrel. May the souls lost to the Calamity find peace in the realm's rebirth."
