※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_01","The investigator shares with you the reports of his fellows in the Central Shroud─it would appear that the Continental Circus's wicked scheme was not restricted to Hyrstmill. Make your way to Bentbranch Meadows, and rendezvous with the Adventurers' Guild investigator.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_02","You join the investigator in Bentbranch, and he grimly explains the situation. Though no children have yet been transformed, it will only be a matter of time before they fall prey to the charms─and curses─of the wily imps. Even as the adventurer contemplates a means by which you might shield the younglings from the illusionists' sinister spells, you hear a voice beckoning you hither. Leave the investigator to his desperate deliberations, and search for the owner of the disembodied voice."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_03","You locate the owner of the voice─the pumpkin-headed stranger─and she once more provides a solution to your occult quandary. She offers you the use of an enchanted broom, whose magic will allow you to sweep away the ability to fling transfiguration curses. Ride the witch's broom around Bentbranch Meadows, and cast Silencing Cant on all the unusual imps you can find."
4,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_04","You find all the imps lurking around Bentbranch Meadows, and use the broom's magic to sweep away their power to curse. Report your deed to the Adventurers' Guild investigator."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_05","The investigator is impressed by your unexpected solution, but laments that it came too late to save one little girl. Considering the case in Hyrstmill, he muses, it is likely that the missing Miqo'te has already been subjected to a fiendish transformation. Speak with the pumpkin-headed apparition once more, and request another batch of curse-breaking cookies."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_06","You bring your request to the pumpkin-headed stranger, and she explains that her cookies must be eaten soon after the transformation takes place to have any effect. She sadly concludes that by the time another batch was baked it would be far too late. It is then that the apparition presents you with another possibility: if you were to burn the witch's broom and sprinkle its ashes over the girl, then the curse would be broken. Look for a fire in which to cast the broom, and then gather its sooty remains."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_07","You burn the witch's broom in a convenient campfire, and gather together its precious ashes. Find the transfigured Miqo'te girl, and use the ash to dispel her monstrous visage."
8,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_08","You find an imp wailing in distress, and shower the creature with the broom ash. Almost instantly, the little girl is restored to her normal form. Return to the Adventurers' Guild investigator and report your success."
9,"TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_09","You return to the investigator to find a relieved T'danafa reunited with her daughter. She thanks you profusely for rescuing T'maritaa, before turning to scold her wayward child. Meanwhile, the lead conspirators of the Continental Circus begin to suspect that someone has learned the trick of dispelling their transformation magicks. Fearing that their identities will be exposed, they choose to abandon their malefic plot and focus on maintaining their entertainers' masquerade.

The pumpkin-headed apparition heralds you as the savior of All Saints' Wake, and rewards you with a new witch's broom. Ride your new prize to the clouds and beyond as you enjoy the remainder of the festival!"
