※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST204_02131_SEQ_01","Motte invites you to play the Spriggan Scramble, one of the activities set up for Hatching-tide. She explains that it is a tallying game in three rounds with different levels of difficulty, and should you clear them all, you will receive a prize. Head over to the beginner eggsaminer to begin the game.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

As you have confidently counted their eggs with ease, head over to the intermediate eggsaminer for a more respectable challenge."
3,"TEXT_FESEST204_02131_SEQ_03","The intermediate eggsaminer adds another egg design to the mix and more spriggans to the fray, but your impeccable memory has again reigned supreme. Head over to the advanced eggsaminer for the final round."

5,"TEXT_FESEST204_02131_SEQ_05","Motte is amazed by your egg counting abilities, confessing even she was unable to pass the advanced round. Speak to her again should you feel the pressing need to count your eggs before they hatch."
