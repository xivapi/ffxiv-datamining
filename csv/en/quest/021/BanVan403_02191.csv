1,"TEXT_BANVAN403_02191_SEQ_01","Muna Vanu points out a noticeable hole in his sash, but is too embarrassed to ask Linu Vanu to make a new one for him. Speak with Linu Vanu on his behalf.

2,"TEXT_BANVAN403_02191_SEQ_02","Linu Vanu realizes that many of the Gundu's sashes are becoming tattered as they build their new home and decides to make fresh traditional garments for the entire tribe. To do so, he needs silk cocoons from the wamoura breeding ground south of Ok' Zundu. Harvest the cocoons and bring them back to Linu Vanu."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN403_02191_SEQ_03","You have harvested the wamoura cocoons. Return to Ok' Gundu Nakki to deliver them to Linu Vanu."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN403_02191_SEQ_04","Linu Vanu is impressed with the cocoons you have delivered to him, and remarks that the silk used for the sashes will undoubtedly make the Vundu envious of Ok' Gundu Nakki's prosperity. He anticipates with bated breath that the cocoons might hold juicy wamoura grubs as a surprise snack, and suggests you try one next time...if you are daring."
