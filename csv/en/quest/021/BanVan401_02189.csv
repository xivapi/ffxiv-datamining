2,"TEXT_BANVAN401_02189_SEQ_02","Linu Vanu tells you the nestlings of Ok' Zundu are anxiously claiming the advent of an airborne beast of Zundu myth. Curious of the tribe's myth and its palpability, he asks that you seek out one of the Zundu nestlings and listen to what they have to say. "
3,"TEXT_BANVAN401_02189_SEQ_03","You speak with the unnerved Zundu nestling, who tells you he has spotted the legendary beast's feathers scattered northeast of Ok' Zundu, directly feeling the “bite” of impending darkness. He asks you to challenge the beast in a daring display of strength."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN401_02189_SEQ_04","The fallen feathers that allegedly came from a mythical beast which attacked the nestlings of Ok' Zundu are not feathers at all, but metal claws from an encroaching Garlean legion.
