She bids you speak with Ardolain, keeper of the Clan Centurio records in the Forgotten Knight, and ask his permission to hunt more dangerous marks."

For more information about the Clan Hunt, or to exchange Centurio Seals for exclusive items, speak with Ardolain in the Forgotten Knight. Otherwise, a whole new category of baneful beasts await their destruction at the hands of a freshly promoted hunts<If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>."
