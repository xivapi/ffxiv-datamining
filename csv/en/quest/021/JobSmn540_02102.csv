1,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_SEQ_01","Dancing Wolf welcomes your return to the Hall of Flames with news of another attack. According to the report, it seems that the villain you assume to be Tristan has struck again at a mining operation in central Thanalan. Head to the Nanawa Mines, and question the miner who survived the slaughter."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_SEQ_02","Tired of the constant interruptions to his work, the assaulted miner stubbornly refuses to answer any more queries until you provide the assistance he has requested. The surly laborer puts Dancing Wolf to work hauling rocks, and assigns you the task of retrieving chunks of fire silver stolen by the local spriggans. Investigate the spriggan scratchings, and wrest the rare ore from the clutches of the thieving soulkin."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_SEQ_03","You have defeated the spriggans, and recovered several chunks of fire silver. Deliver the ore to the assaulted miner at the Nanawa Mines."
4,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_SEQ_04","Pleased by the return of his fire silver, the miner at last agrees to share the tale of the attack. Y'mhitra arrives just as the laborer begins his story, and once more signals you to summon Ifrit-Egi as a means of confirming the attacker's identity. In response to the question of what motivated the villain's actions, the miner insists that Tristan was after only one thing: crystals. Return to the Hall of Flames, and discuss this worrying revelation."
5,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_SEQ_05","After reexamining various incident reports, Dancing Wolf is convinced that Tristan was behind several other recent attacks that were mistakenly attributed to the Amalj'aa. With every case involving the theft of crystals, Y'mhitra voices the concern of all present: the nefarious madman harbors plans to call forth a primal. If the atrocities of the past are to be averted in the present, then you must take full advantage of Y'mhitra's studies, and master the recovered wisdom of Allag's summoners.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 56."

49,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_DANCINGWOLF_000_001","I looked over the notes for the initial investigation, and it would seem Tristan─or someone who looks very much like him─has struck again.

53,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_MINER02102_000_011","...Here's an idea, though: how about you scratch my back, an' I'll scratch yours? That big lad in the uniform there looks like he could lift some good-sized rocks!"

...Captain Wolf? Is everything all right?"

64,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_MINER02102_000_042","Aye, I reckon you've earned it. Well, we was in the mine, loadin' the carts with our haul for the day, when this bloke in robes appears. Doesn't say a word─the bastard just snaps his fingers, an' sets his pet demon to lightin' me mates on fire..."

69,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_MINER02102_000_047","I'm not ashamed to say that I fled for me life once folk started goin' up in flames. But when I went back to sort out the mess, the cart what had the crystals in it was empty."

71,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_MINER02102_000_049","Aye, every single one. An' that's all I've got to say about that. Hope you catch the bastard!"
72,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_DANCINGWOLF_000_050","Crystals... There was a crate of crystals on the list of goods stolen from that caravan. He must have taken everything else to conceal his intent..."
73,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_DANCINGWOLF_000_051","Our quarry grows careless...or simply impatient. It is time I reexamined certain other incidents that we did not think related to this case. Meet me at the Hall of Flames and we shall discuss the matter further."
74,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_052","I can imagine only one reason why a man such as Tristan would seek to acquire a wealth of crystals... Come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─let us not keep Captain Wolf waiting."
75,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_055","Whatever evil our callous foe is planning, we cannot allow it to come to fruition. Let us speak with Captain Wolf, and learn what else his investigations have uncovered."
76,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_DANCINGWOLF_000_060","...I inspected our incident records, paying close attention to cargo manifests that included crystals. We had attributed several recent raids to the Amalj'aa, but the victims were, every one of them, burned to death. Not entirely impossible, considering the lizardmen's affinity for fire, but to find not a single arrow or spear wound...?"
77,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_061","Aye, 'tis highly unlikely. Mayhap I should state aloud what we are all thinking..."
78,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_062","Judging by the sheer number of crystals involved, we must assume that this villain intends to call forth a primal."
79,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_DANCINGWOLF_000_063","After my encounter with Ifrit, I learned just how devastatingly powerful these entities can be... And I believe that summoners, with their ability to harness such power, hold the potential to achieve great things."
80,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_DANCINGWOLF_000_064","But if Tristan truly is mad enough to summon a primal, then that unthinkable act─and the bloody deeds he performed in preparation for it─will cause people to question the motives of all who practice the summoner's art!"
81,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_065","My studies of the tomestones revealed to me a tale of adulation: the summoners of Allag were revered as heroes for their part in defeating the ancient primals."
82,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_066","But reverence slowly turned to revulsion as practitioners─intoxicated by their own immense power─began wielding the art of summoning as a means to further their own selfish ambitions."
83,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_067","That is not to say, of course, that all summoners chose to become tyrants. Amongst the common people, however, it became a strongly held superstition that those who meddled in the powers of primals ultimately fell into the embrace of evil."
84,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_068","This superstition blossomed into outright terror, and that is when the mage hunts began... By the end of the Third Astral Era, the last of the summoners had vanished from the stage of history."
85,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_DANCINGWOLF_000_069","And should we allow Tristan to go through with his plans, then we risk a repeat of that tragedy. I will review the state of patrols on the crystal trade routes─we <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> catch him!"
86,"TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_YMHITRA_000_070","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Before I joined you at the Nanawa Mines, I was able to recover another incantation that may prove useful in the coming days. Wield its power wisely..."
