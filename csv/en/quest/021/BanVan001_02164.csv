1,"TEXT_BANVAN001_02164_SEQ_01","Sonu Vanu is grateful for your return to Ok' Zundu, for as if by heavenly coincidence, something is troubling him that only a courageous adventurer can help with. Zundu spies have reported unusual amounts of activity from Ok' Vundu Mok, in the heart of Vundu territory. The Zundu chief is anxious as to what this might mean for his tribe, but cannot risk the uneasy truce with the Vundu by sending his own spies. He asks that you make your way to Ok' Vundu Mok to ascertain what is causing the furor.

You stand fearless before the dance, however, and leap to the defense of the shivering Vanu."

Her tribe seeks freedom from the Vundu, but they will not allow it, threatening any opposition with violence and imprisonment. Linu Vali is surprised when you tell her of Sonu Vanu's request, and asks that you act as a mediator in helping the Gundu tell of their plight. Return to Ok' Zundu and inform Sonu Vanu of the occurrences at Ok' Vundu Mok."
5,"TEXT_BANVAN001_02164_SEQ_05","You relate the story of your journey into Ok' Vundu to Sonu Vanu, and Linu Vali offers her greetings and gratitude to the chieftain. Taking the story of the Gundu's plight to heart, Sonu Vanu grants the refugees an island to use as a safe haven, despite his attendant's protestations. Linu Vali is ecstatic at this present, promising that the Gundu will be self-sufficient, and work to make a new settlement free from Vundu influence.

She admits to you that she lacks the courage to continue on leading the Gundu towards a new life, expressing doubt in her ability to carry on without her brother and the others that were captured by the Vundu. She asks for your help in building up the Gundu's new home. Your agreement encourages her, and she dubs the new village “Ok' Gundu Nakki.” Eager to get started on construction, she asks you to speak with Muna Vanu to learn what tasks are required of you. Lend your aid to the refugee Vanu Vanu and help them build a new home."
