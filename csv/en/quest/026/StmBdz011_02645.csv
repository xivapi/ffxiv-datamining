You look like you can hold your own in a fight. Would you mind lending me a hand?"

50,"TEXT_STMBDZ011_02645_ANSGER_000_002","Quarrying requires huge amounts of water─which becomes awfully dirty in the process. Should this water find its way into the reservoir next to the village, we'd lose our only source of clean drinking water."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ011_02645_ANSGER_000_030","Brilliant! These will help us to remove any mineral dust from the water we use when quarrying."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ011_02645_ANSGER_000_031","In the days before the Empire invaded, the entire village used to go out on anila hunts together to collect their cores. We just don't have the bodies for it now that half of Ala Gannha has been absorbed into the imperial army."
