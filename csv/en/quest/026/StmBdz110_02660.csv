49,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_001","My analysis of the samples you brought me is coming along quite nicely, but there is one more area I would have you investigate."
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_002","There's a cavern southeast of here, the Comet's Tail, so named for the glowing ore covering its walls and ceiling, as if the gods themselves captured starlight and placed it there."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_003","Despite its supposed beauty, however, I have heard reports that the area has been adversely affected by pollution. As before I need you to procure three samples of the soil and one of the water so I can ascertain the truth of what has happened there."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_004","Whatever damage has been done to that cavern, I pray it is not irreversible. I will require samples of both the soil and water there to be certain."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_010","Did you have trouble procuring the samples?"
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_011","Yes, this is perfect. Perhaps someday soon we can restore the cave to what it once was."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_012","You see, the Comet's Tail was once a place of worship. Legend has it that, as the great flood of the Sixth Umbral Calamity swept across Eorzea, Rhalgr cast a great beacon into the sky to lead His people to safety. That beacon would one day fall to earth, and its remains are what illuminate that cave."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_013","The Ala Mhigans placed altars within, and would often visit to offer up prayers to Rhalgr. Of course, that all changed when the Garleans came..."
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_014","No one is certain for what purpose the cave was closed off, but some say it was used as a crude weapons research facility."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_015","Whatever the truth may be, I will find it, and restore what was taken from the Ala Mhigans."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ110_02660_LUCINNE_000_016","When that day comes, I hope you'll go and pay the Comet's Tail a visit."
