62,"TEXT_STMBDZ209_02681_AFUMI_100_031","But he will grow accustomed to this life. He is hardly the first, after all. The captain too was once of Doma, though he cast all aside twenty and five years ago, when the imperials took his lands and the lives of his parents and brothers."
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ209_02681_AFUMI_000_033","Perhaps you too will renounce your ties and join us someday? Aye, I mistook you for a recruit before, but I know your tale now. Tansui unfolded all."
