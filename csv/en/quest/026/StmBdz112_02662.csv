1,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_01","The lieutenant is back on her feet, and ready to continue the investigation. She means to leave no stone unturned, and suggests splitting up to cover more ground."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_02","Upon investigating the buildings, you notice they are suspiciously clean, and the ground surrounding them is littered with fresh footprints. Perhaps Lieutenant Molkoh has found more concrete evidence of what happened in Bittermill."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_03","You find the lieutenant in the company of a peculiar man who seems bereft of his memories. He can recall nothing, not even his own identity. The only thing he is certain of is a tenuous connection he has with Bittermill. Suspecting he is one of the missing prisoners, Lieutenant Molkoh convinces him to accompany you both back to Castrum Oriens."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_04","Serpent Marshal Brookstone is pleased with this sudden turn of events, quickly sending Lieutenant Molkoh off to provide their new detainee with a hot meal, after which he is to be questioned. The serpent marshal bids you wait with him until the interrogation has finished."

50,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_003","Now, let's begin our search. We're like to cover more ground if we split up. Hopefully there is still some trace of the prisoners left here."

56,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_021","I found someone while inspecting the houses. He seems...unwell."
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SHABBYMAN02662_000_022","(-Frantic Fellow-)Unwell? Unwell!? No, no, no, definitely not. Certainly not. Yes, we're quite fine. But what of you? A little girl, dressed in strange clothes. Quite strange, quite strange."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_023","Wh-What? You have some nerve. Regardless of how I look, I am a ranking officer of the Order of the Twin Adder, thank you very much. Now who are you, and what business do you have here?"
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SHABBYMAN02662_000_024","(-Frantic Fellow-)Who? Yes, who! An excellent question! You are you, but who are we? Yes, we would like to know very much, very much."
60,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_025","You don't remember? Well, is there anything you can remember?"
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SHABBYMAN02662_000_026","(-Frantic Fellow-)Remember...remember... Remember! Yes, something about this place. Something familiar, quite familiar."
62,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_027","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. This is only a hunch, mind you, but I suspect he is not from this place. Considering he's Elezen, he's likely a Gridanian escaped from the Garleans. Or perhaps..."
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_028","Could he be one of the missing prisoners? It would certainly explain the Garlean soldiers from before. We need to take him back for questioning."
64,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_029","Excuse me sir, but would you be willing to come back with us? At the very least it would be more comfortable than these dilapidated houses, and we may be able to help you recover your memory."
65,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SHABBYMAN02662_000_030","(-Frantic Fellow-)Mmm...memories, sweet memories. Yes, we would like them very much, very much."
66,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_031","Alright then. Let's return to Castrum Oriens. <sigh> My browbeating commander will likely wish to meet you. I suppose it can't be helped."

68,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_040","Possibly one of the missing prisoners, you say? I expected such wild claims from Lieutenant Molkoh, but if you would corroborate her report, perhaps this warrants investigation. Until further notice, he shall stay under the protection of the Eorzean Alliance."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_041","Sir? With all due respect, you cannot just─"
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_042","Lieutenant Molkoh. Get this man a hot meal and a warm bed. When he's had a bit of rest, see what he knows of Bittermill and the Garleans."
71,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_043","It should not be long before we reach a resolution to all this. You're free to wait here until she finishes questioning our new detainee."
72,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_045","If he really is one of the missing prisoners, this could be the defining moment of my career! Even Serpent Marshal Brookstone is sure to take notice."
