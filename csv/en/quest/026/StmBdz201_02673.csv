49,"TEXT_STMBDZ201_02673_YUSUI_000_001","The other day, we found one of their men stowed away on a ship we confiscated. With a bit of coaxing, he eventually confessed to doing some underhanded trading with the Red Kojin on behalf of his superior."

The man, upon learning his subordinate disappeared, feared he would be caught and turned tail and ran.
