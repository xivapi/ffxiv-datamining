53,"TEXT_STMBDZ115_02665_EMPLOYEE02665_000_011","I meant to make my way to the artisan's shop to pick up Master's order, but lost my way. Begging your pardon, I am newly come to this place, and have never known such city streets. Surely one so traveled as yourself has no such problems."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ115_02665_EMPLOYEE02665_000_012","No doubt the lash awaits me upon my return, but I fear the deed hopeless for me. Could I ask, will you seek out the Rakuza District's veteran lanternmaker in my stead? He holds a paper lantern crate for my master that must be delivered with all haste."

57,"TEXT_STMBDZ115_02665_LANTERNCRAFTER02665_000_021","Damned hassle of an order, too. I've been at this more years than I can count, and that bloody lantern was a test for even my hand."

61,"TEXT_STMBDZ115_02665_EMPLOYEE02665_000_032","If Master refers to the figurehead carving for his pleasure barge, then all is proceeding smoothly, save for just one small thing.

64,"TEXT_STMBDZ115_02665_EMPLOYEE02665_000_035","You've brought the crate that contains Master's paper lantern. Thank you. My own failure was reason enough for the lash, but had the delay given the lanternmaker cause to sell to another... Shudder to think. Please, give it to Master right away!"
