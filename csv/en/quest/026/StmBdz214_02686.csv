52,"TEXT_STMBDZ214_02686_UMIBETA_000_011","One of my men has been derelict in his duties. He has been allowing vessels to pass through the Ruby Sea free of charge. We suspect he is either a coward that is afraid of crossing swords with another...or he is taking bribes."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ214_02686_UMIBETA_000_012","We shall find out soon enough. You are to pose as a foreign merchant and approach the watchguard I speak of, who is stationed in the Shoal Rock area to the southeast of here, and threaten him."

62,"TEXT_STMBDZ214_02686_UMIBETA_000_042","Ah, you must be confused. There is something I must confess. The real reason I asked you to confront him was not because he was being lax in his duties, but rather to test him."
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ214_02686_UMIBETA_000_043","Whenever there is threat of an attack upon the Coral Banquet, our men stationed there are trained to drop everything and dash to the headquarters to call for reinforcements. We needed to ensure he would follow protocol."

66,"TEXT_STMBDZ214_02686_ARANAMI_000_050","Welcome back. Training was a success, I take it. Earlier, one of our new watchguard came sprinting to us, shouting about an attack until he was blue in the face!"
67,"TEXT_STMBDZ214_02686_ARANAMI_000_051","Bahaha! I hope one day you can teach me how to be so intimidating."
