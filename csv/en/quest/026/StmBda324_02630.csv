1,"TEXT_STMBDA324_02630_SEQ_01","Though your attempt on Zenos's life ended in failure, it spurred the people of Doma to rise up and openly oppose the imperials in battle. Convinced that this is the sign that Lord Hien has been waiting for, you and your comrades embark on a journey to the Azim Steppe to seek out the young heir and convince him to return to lead his people in a new rebellion against the Empire. And so you depart once more for the Ruby Sea, and a familiar fishing village on the coast."
