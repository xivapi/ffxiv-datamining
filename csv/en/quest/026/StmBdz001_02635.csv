51,"TEXT_STMBDZ001_02635_BEVES_000_003","Primary sources are indispensable, and I had a mind to question a number of my fellow freedom fighters─ask them their motivations for taking up this cause and so forth."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ001_02635_HROTMAR_000_011","We owned a stall in the markets, and a passing soldier snatched up a piece of fruit. He spoke out before I could stop him, only to get a fulm of steel in the gut for his troubles. I found my way here, and that was that."

62,"TEXT_STMBDZ001_02635_BEVES_000_030","Well met, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Have you spoken with the freedom fighters as I asked?"
63,"TEXT_STMBDZ001_02635_BEVES_000_031","Hmm... As fascinating as they are varied... You have a knack for convincing others to bare their hearts to you. I could not have done better myself."
