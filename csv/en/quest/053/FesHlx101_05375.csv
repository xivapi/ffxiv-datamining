She senses, however, that aught is amiss within its confines, and urges you speak with the genial guiser to guide you to the manor's gates.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

Though he and his troupe once sought to take advantage of mortal guests in years past, he claims to have turned over a new leaf, and though he urges you to listen to the cries of joy echoing throughout the manor, you are answered with naught but screams of terror. Perplexed by such a reaction, the Impresario bids you investigate the cause of this commotion, starting with the manor's second floor."
