50,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_3","A traveling merchant was here not a bell ago to discuss a potential contract with us. In the midst of negotiations, Gigi commented on the man's jewelry, claiming “such tawdry baubles are beneath even a Lominsan whore.” Unsurprisingly, the man became quite upset and stormed off."
51,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_4","Our members understand that Gigi can be a harsh critic, but this foreign gentleman Roroton was visiting us for the first time."
52,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_5","Aye, if it were a guild member, we might have overlooked the incident, but he was a potential business partner! Gods, this is a disaster for the guild."

55,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_9","You're one of our best, so I'd like you to craft the earrings. When they are ready, please present them to me for inspection."

58,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_12","Despite being relatively commonplace, malachite is quite sought after, owing to its supposed power to ward off evil. Pieces bearing swirls that resemble an eye are especially popular."

66,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_20","...From Mistress Serendipity? I'm speechless. I never imagined the guildmaster would go so far as to personally craft─"

68,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_22","The gods do indeed work in mysterious ways!"
69,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_23","I don't believe I have properly introduced myself. I am Roroton, a traveling entrepreneur. I go wherever opportunity beckons, buying for a gil and selling for two."

72,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_26","I would be honored if you allowed me to purchase more of your fine merchandise. Permit me to sell your wares, and we will both be wealthy in no time."
73,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_27","Ah, but forgive my impetuousness. You are a guild goldsmith, and I must go through the proper channels. Very well! I will meet with Mistress Serendipity once more."
74,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_28","Please give my card to your guildmaster, and inform her that I shall contact her again soon to resume contract negotiations."
75,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_29","Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! While you were gone, I performed some basic maintenance on Gigi. I'm not sure if I fixed the problem─or if there was even a problem to begin with, but─"
76,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_30","Oh, but what about Roroton? Did you find him?"

79,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_34","I knew I was right to count on you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. There's something about your work that moves people, something that touches the soul."
80,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_35","It's a gift, and it can't be taught, much as I wish it could. No, you've always had it in you. And as you grow more skilled, you'll only become better at expressing it."
81,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_36","I'm certain that was part of Roroton's decision. Since we know he'll request your services when he next visits, you'd best work hard until the time comes!"
82,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_50","It was a pleasure meeting you. I believe we will have a most profitable relationship in the days to come."
