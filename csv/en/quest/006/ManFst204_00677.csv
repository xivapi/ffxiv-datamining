1,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_01","It would seem that a cult known as the Lambs of Dalamud has been engaging in suspicious activity in the Tam–Tara Deepcroft. Make your way to the burial site and ask the Quiverman posted at the entrance for further instructions."
2,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_02","You learn that the Lambs of Dalamud believe in the divinity of the lesser moon whose descent ushered in the Seventh Umbral Era. Since Dalamud's apparent destruction─for which they blame the people of Eorzea─it seems they have been seeking a means to avenge their god. Purge the Deepcroft of cultists before they can put their deranged schemes into action.

※Challenge the Tam–Tara Deepcroft with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point."
3,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_03","While scouring the depths of the Tam–Tara Deepcroft, you are assailed by a vengeful spirit who had been awakened in the corse of Galvanth the Dominator. After a titanic struggle, you succeed in sending this dark being back to the abyss, thus foiling the cultists' plot. Make haste back to Gridania, and report all that has transpired to Miounne."
4,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_04","Miounne reveals that death is becoming an ever more common occurrence within the adventuring fraternity. She attributes this unfortunate trend to the burgeoning demand for adventurers' services, which has allowed unprepared individuals to take on tasks which are beyond them. Confident that you will give her no cause to worry, Miounne informs you that the Adventurers' Guild in Ul'dah is recruiting. Speak with her again if you would know more."

53,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_9","Now, time is of the essence, so I shall proceed directly to the heart of the matter. We wish for you to nip a potential threat to Gridania in the bud."
54,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_10","Beneath the Central Shroud, there lies an underground burial site called the Tam–Tara Deepcroft."
55,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_11","The place was once a Gelmorran settlement, but we Gridanians have long interred our dead there."
56,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_12","Of late, however, shadowy figures have been seen skulking about the Deepcroft, and with ever-increasing regularity."
57,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_13","Based on the accounts of various witnesses, we suspect that these individuals belong to the Lambs of Dalamud, a doomsday cult which sprung up prior to the Calamity."

59,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_15","Ordinarily, I would have dispatched my best men to scour the Deepcroft with orders to flush the cultists out."
60,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_16","Alas, the Calamity decimated our ranks, and the limited forces at my disposal are constantly required to keep the Ixal at bay."
61,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_17","Since we thwarted their attack on the Guardian Tree, the birdmen have not allowed us a moment's respite. They have probed every ilm of our defenses in search of a weakness, compelling me to spread our forces far more thinly than I would like."
62,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_18","The situation so being, we have no choice but to entrust the task of dealing with the Lambs of Dalamud to others. Can we rely on you to handle this matter, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
63,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_19","The birdmen have grown restless of late, and I fear a storm may be brewing. In anticipation of this, I have been compelled to spread our forces throughout the Twelveswood, lest we be taken unawares."

70,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_32","In case you're unfamiliar with them, the cult emerged shortly before the Calamity put an end to the Sixth Astral Era."
71,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_33","The cultists took the lesser moon, Dalamud, for their god, believing that it would deliver them from the devastation."
72,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_34","And so they were rather disappointed when Dalamud exploded into a thousand flaming pieces before it could complete its descent."
73,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_35","Now, having seen their god turn to ash, one would think that the cultists might feel moved to question their faith. On the contrary, it served only to stoke the flames of their fanaticism."
74,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_36","The Lambs of Dalamud are convinced that “heretics”─that is to say, <Emphasis>everyone but them</Emphasis>─interfered with the coming of their lord and savior, and that it's now their sacred duty to avenge him."

82,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ISILDAURE_000_57","Always look before you leap... In my haste, this most fundamental rule of adventuring slipped my mind. <sigh> I do believe I shall rest here awhile."

84,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ALIANNE_000_61","Sometimes he has too much vigor for his own good. Age is supposed to mellow us, but if anything it has made him more impetuous."

86,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_65","The Lambs of Dalamud are hells-bent on avenging their imaginary god, and will stop at nothing till their dark work is done."

89,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_71","Nor did I expect anything less. You've made such a habit of succeeding that it's difficult not to take your talents for granted. Rest assured, however: Mother <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> impressed, even if she isn't surprised."
90,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_72","Nor did I expect anything less. Baderon's ringing endorsement left me in little doubt as to your capabilities. Even so, you are to be commended."
91,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_73","Bowlord Lewin asked me to pass on his thanks."
92,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_74","I must say, it's something of a relief to be able to call upon such a capable adventurer."
93,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_75","Sadly, death has become an ever more common occurrence within our fraternity of late. Times being what they are, the guild is constantly inundated with petitions, and we are hard-pressed to find enough hands to deal with them all."
94,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_76","While this means no shortage of work for able souls such as yourself, it also provides ample opportunity for the inexperienced to overreach themselves─with predictable consequences. Ah...as if to illustrate the point..."
95,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LIAVINNE_000_77","Avere's gone, and it's all your fault! If it hadn't taken you an age to heal him, he would still be alive!"

99,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LIAVINNE_000_81","I'm leaving as well. I doubt this comes as any surprise, but I <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> liked you. I only suffered you for your healing, but you couldn't even do that one thing right. Cruel though this may sound, you brought this upon yourself."
100,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LIAVINNE_000_82","Oh, and by way of some parting advice...get rid of Avere's head! Bury it, cremate it, do whatever the hells you like with it─but for gods' sakes, stop carrying it around! It's...it's just... Just get rid of it, all right!?"

105,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_87","Speaking of missions, I would entrust you with another."
106,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_88","About a bell ago, I received a message from my counterpart in Ul'dah. She seeks the services of a reliable adventurer, and you are nothing if not reliable."
