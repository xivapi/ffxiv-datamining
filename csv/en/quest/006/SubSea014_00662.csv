If you insist upon visiting, O'kalkaya strongly suggests that you first pay your respects and /kneel to the captain."
2,"TEXT_SUBSEA014_00662_SEQ_02","Rhoswen explains that the Sanguine Sirens are struggling to capture imperial vessels because their rivals, the Kraken's Arms, are seizing them first. Show Captain Rhoswen that you are /disappointed with this turn of events."
