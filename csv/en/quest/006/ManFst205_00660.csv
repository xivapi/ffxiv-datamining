62,"TEXT_MANFST205_00660_PAPASHAN_000_17","The people of that age used the hecatoncheires to work their mines. By way of enchanted helms, they were able to bind the ferocious creatures to their will.

63,"TEXT_MANFST205_00660_PAPASHAN_000_18","In a desperate bid to contain the unbridled fury of the hecatoncheires, our ancestors induced the collapse of the mines' lowermost levels. So it was that the Great Giant Revolt was ended─buried beneath a hundred thousand tonzes of rock."
