49,"TEXT_SUBWIL110_00618_ISEMBARD_000_2","Much harm has been levied on these lands by Amalj'aa hands. The Flames burn where they might, but their light cannot stay the darkness in all places at all times."

56,"TEXT_SUBWIL110_00618_ISEMBARD_000_012","Now, then, what of the Amalj'aa? Did you see any? Surely such massive monstrosities as they cannot conceal their presence, much less take their quarry unawares."
57,"TEXT_SUBWIL110_00618_ISEMBARD_000_013","Ah, so there <Emphasis>were</Emphasis> Amalj'aa remaining, after all... I feared as much. Their part in the lowborn disappearing is all but confirmed. But I sense there is more to this than meets the eye."
58,"TEXT_SUBWIL110_00618_ISEMBARD_000_014","The occasional Amalj'aa raiding party would not account for people going missing in these kinds of numbers. The total is too great, and the questions too many. It would not surprise me in the least to learn of another hand in this."
59,"TEXT_SUBWIL110_00618_ISEMBARD_000_015","But whose? Countless travelers pass through Drybone every day. And even if it were one among them, how would we best discover who may be implicit in these vanishings?"
