49,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_TMOKKRI_000_2","Guildleves are the means by which we document requests for assistance from the citizenry, prior to assigning them to adventurers possessed of the necessary skills."

51,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_TMOKKRI_000_4","Should your interest be piqued, I suggest you make your way to Swiftperch and speak with Swygskyf. He will be happy to set your feet on the path to completing your first levequest."

56,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_SWYGSKYF_000_14","Good to hear. Now, megalocrabs, they like to run off to their mates when they're feelin' overmatched. If ye don't want to find yerself armpits-deep in snippers, then ye'd best finish 'em quickly."
