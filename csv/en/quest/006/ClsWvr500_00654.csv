1,"TEXT_CLSWVR500_00654_SEQ_01","Mamajaru, the wealthy Lalafell for whom you once crafted an acton, intends to propose to Kokomo. Upon learning of this, Wawarukka rushes to the guild, exclaiming that he must tell the girl how he feels before it's too late. To that end, he begs you and Redolent Rose for a set of fine garments so he can make the best possible impression. Craft and deliver a high-quality pair of patrician's bottoms, a high-quality patrician's wedge cap, and a high-quality patrician's coatee to Redolent Rose─the guildmaster will prepare the other pieces."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR500_00654_SEQ_02","Wawarukka is overjoyed by the ensemble you and the guildmaster have prepared. However, it may all be for naught─Kokomo is currently in the company of Mamajaru, and the guildmaster suspects that the proposal may be imminent. Wawarukka quickly departs for the Gold Court to see Kokomo, and Redolent Rose bids you follow to observe what transpires."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR500_00654_SEQ_03","Though hesitant at first, Wawarukka rushes to Kokomo's side when Mamajaru attempts to strike her in a fit of anger. Filled with newfound confidence, he confronts the wealthy heir, who then flees. Now alone, Wawarukka and Kokomo stare deep into each other's eyes and begin a long-overdue conversation. Having observed that things are proceeding smoothly, you quietly excuse yourself. Return to the Weavers' Guild and tell Redolent Rose what you saw."
4,"TEXT_CLSWVR500_00654_SEQ_04","Upon hearing your account, Redolent Rose cannot help but laugh. Though clearly pleased to have helped the two young Lalafells, he asserts that he has acted only as a professional serving his clients. The future of Wawarukka and Kokomo's relationship is hardly certain, but he nevertheless compliments you on a job well done.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"
