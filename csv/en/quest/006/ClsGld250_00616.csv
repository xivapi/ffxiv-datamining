Thankfully, the failing part is one she can reproduce, so the stalwart assistant should soon be back to normal.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 30."

62,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_15","Well, it may seem that way to you, but I can assure you he's quite out of sorts. Anyway...silver was historically prized for its beauty. Ancient peoples even believed it to possess magical properties."

67,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_20","When he was first built over a century ago, he knew nothing. But, by assisting guildmaster after guildmaster, he's come to possess more wisdom and experience than any living goldsmith."
68,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_21","That knowledge...and the gentle soul that carries it, are our guild's greatest treasures."
