50,"TEXT_SUBWIL115_00624_TUTUSI_000_3","We're tending a wounded man at the inn who is close to death. We would like nothing more than to give him a feast of nice, juicy myotragus sirloins for what might well be his last meal."

Best to let it go and move on. There's business what needs doing. Plots, graves, embalming, tombstones. Nothing in life is free─not even death."
