3,"TEXT_JOBMNK700_02430_SEQ_03","Theobald arrives at the prescribed hour, and he and Widargelt square off before the gathered villagers. But before fists fly, it is revealed that Theobald is in fact Adri, Widargelt's dear comrade from his time at the Temple of the Fist. Made to feel powerless due to his low birth, he resents Widargelt for spurning his royal blood and the might it represents. Once the talking ends and they engage, it becomes clear that Widargelt has the upper hand, and Adri summons his minions to his aid and resorts to using imperial weaponry. For a blessing, Hamon appears with Chuchuto and Rurukuta, having been informed of the duel, and they join the fray to even the odds. At the end of a long struggle, you and yours emerge triumphant."

D'zentsa and O'tchakha, meanwhile, reaffirm their resolve to grow stronger, that they might better support their master in his endeavors. Last but not least, Erik expresses his gratitude for the role you played in helping Widargelt to forge on in the face of adversity. With the others having taken their leave, you may now give your undivided attention to your brother monk."
