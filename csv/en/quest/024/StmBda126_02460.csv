51,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_RAGANFRID_000_020","We owe you a debt of gratitude for what you did. Wercrata told me everything─how you fought with the Qiqirn and saved his life."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_LYSE_000_021","For all the good it did. We saw what happened when he met with the Skulls. How they beat him half to death. We could've stopped them."
53,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_RAGANFRID_000_022","Aye, I reckon you could. Meffrid's a warrior, as is your comrade. And you're strong, like your father. That much is plain."
54,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_RAGANFRID_000_023","But I thank Rhalgr you did not, because it would not have ended with them. Wercrata and his sister would've been branded insurgents, if not the whole lot of us."

59,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_LYSE_000_028","...I understand. Thank you for your honesty."

67,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_LYSE_000_072","I'm not <Emphasis>completely</Emphasis> naive, you know. I didn't expect them to “storm a castrum with their pickaxes and shovels,” or whatever it was. But nor did I expect Wercrata to just lie there in the dirt while they kicked him."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_LYSE_000_073","I can't claim to know their pain. I barely remember this place or...or even my father's face."

73,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_WISCAR_000_078","Aye, that I do... I, um... I said some things to you before that I shouldn't've. 'Twasn't my place to do so, and I'm sorry."
74,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_WISCAR_000_079","All that rubbish I spouted about how I loved my village...but when one of ours was in need, I was cowering here with all the others. I didn't even think to go after Wercrata...but you did."

78,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_WISCAR_000_082","When you put it like that, I, uh...I suppose I am. But not just me─there are others I know who've been thinking about it for a while now. There's not many of us, and we're not hardened warriors like you lot, but─"

83,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_MEFFRID_000_087","And with that, my friends, our mission is concluded. Let us return to the Reach."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_MEFFRID_000_090","First of all, allow me to commend you both on a job well done."
85,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_MEFFRID_000_091","Though nothing went according to plan, we nevertheless managed to attract some new recruits. And it was your passion and conviction that moved them to join. Thank you."
86,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_LYSE_000_092","No, thank <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>─for giving me an opportunity to find out what our people have been through these past twenty years. It's been...humbling."
87,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_LYSE_000_093","And troubling, too. I'd heard about the Skulls, but that was the first time I'd seen them in the flesh."
88,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_LYSE_000_094","I know you say they're the same as any other imperial soldiers─and maybe that's how I'll have to think of them myself if our paths ever cross on the battlefield, but─"
89,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_MEFFRID_000_095","<Emphasis>When</Emphasis>, not if. That day will come, Lyse. You can't afford to hesitate when it does."
90,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_MEFFRID_000_096","Young, old, conscript, citizen, Garlean, Ala Mhigan─none of that matters. They've all got their reasons. But they're no better than yours, especially when they're bearing down on you, blade in hand."
91,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_MEFFRID_000_097","...Saying that, I don't want to kill them any more than you do. If I could convince them to lay down their arms, I would. Sadly, I've never been much of a talker myself, but who knows, maybe you could be one, Lyse. Your father certainly was."
92,"TEXT_STMBDA126_02460_MEFFRID_000_098","Right, then. I'd best begin preparing for these new recruits. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, Lyse, it's been a pleasure."
