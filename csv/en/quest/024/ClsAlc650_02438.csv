93,"TEXT_CLSALC650_02438_GREINFARR_000_068","If only. I saw how he was. Dead, but not. It wasn't natural. I'd heard of the blade and what it could do. I suspected it had been used on him."
94,"TEXT_CLSALC650_02438_GREINFARR_000_069","So I thought if Heartstrike could be used to do this, perhaps it could be used to undo it. I meant to free his spirit from whatever gaol it's in. I learned the blade belonged to Lord Lolorito, and so I broke into his estate and stole it."
95,"TEXT_CLSALC650_02438_FLHAMINN_000_070","But the Heartstrike you took was already void of power, if it ever had any at all. And so you weren't able to save Nielle with it."
