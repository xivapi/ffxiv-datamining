1,"TEXT_STMBDA103_02448_SEQ_01","Conrad Kemp, the commander of the Ala Mhigan Resistance in Rhalgr's Reach, understands that you have important matters to discuss, and would not do so on their doorstep. He motions for you and the others to follow him deeper into the hidden sanctuary."
2,"TEXT_STMBDA103_02448_SEQ_02","The commander listens patiently as Alphinaud explains the details of the Eorzean Alliance's proposal. Together they would expel the imperial presence from Gyr Abania─or as Conrad wryly puts it, “engage them by proxy” with the vastly inferior forces of the Resistance. In any event, such weighty decisions cannot be made lightly, and the commander and his officers will need time to reach a consensus."

50,"TEXT_STMBDA103_02448_KRILE_000_010","Ordinarily, I'd shudder at the thought of armed rebels trampling about in an ancient temple of immense historical importance─but Rhalgr <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> the breaker of worlds, so it seems rather appropriate, if anything."
