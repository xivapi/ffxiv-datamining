1,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SEQ_01","Raya–O–Senna suggests that you offer your assistance with resolving some mysterious disturbance that is agitating the elementals. Make your way to the Conjurers' Guild in Gridania, and present yourself to Brother E–Sumi–Yan."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SEQ_02","The guildmaster is enthusiastic to receive your proffered aid, and soon explains why: the elementals' disquiet appears to stem from East End, the war-torn region lying on the border between Gridania and Gyr Abania, and he deems a journey into this unstable area best attempted with you at his side. Make your preparations, and meet Brother E–Sumi–Yan at Nine Ivies in the East Shroud."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SEQ_03","Upon arriving in Nine Ivies, E–Sumi–Yan confirms that the source of the disturbance is indeed originating from the direction of East End. His questing senses also reveal a guilty-looking Sylphie, who claims to be unable to ignore the keening plight of the forest spirits. The guildmaster reluctantly allows her to join your party, and the three of you make for Castrum Oriens to continue the investigation...

※The serpent officer stationed at Amarissaix's Spire in the East Shroud will grant you passage to Castrum Oriens."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SEQ_04","You rejoin Brother E–Sumi–Yan, and he suggests splitting up to search for the exact location of the disturbance. Head towards the southwest, and survey the area for anything unusual."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SEQ_05","You peer about for a sign of what might be upsetting the elementals, and are surprised to spot a child and her protective mother in the supposedly treacherous lands of East End. Aside from this unexpected encounter, however, you are unable to pinpoint the origin of the disturbance. Return to Castrum Oriens and aid the guildmaster in learning more about the area's inhabitants."
6,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SEQ_06","Though the matter is far from resolved, Brother E–Sumi–Yan feels he has already been absent too long from Stillglade Fane. Sylphie then offers to remain in Castrum Oriens, and take up the investigation in his place. The guildmaster acquiesces...on the condition that you agree to supervise her efforts. The future promises to be full of challenges, and you will need to continue your studies if you are to be sure of meeting them.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Sylphie upon reaching level 63."

Ah, Sister Raya–O–Senna directed you to the guild? Glad I am that she did."
55,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_ESUMIYAN_000_011","As I am sure you have felt yourself, the elementals are in an uproar. And whilst I would soon depart on my investigation, the forest's disquiet appears to stem from lands that cannot be approached in blind haste."
56,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_ESUMIYAN_000_012","I speak of East End, at the very edge of the Twelveswood. Long has this border betwixt Gyr Abania and our nation been held by the forces of the Garlean Empire."
57,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_ESUMIYAN_000_013","The Alliance did recently take control of Baelsar's Wall, and thus commands the fortifications in East End, but the stability of the region is yet tenuous at best."

67,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SYLPHIE_000_025","Yes, Guildmaster. I'm sorry for leaving without permission, but I just <Emphasis>had</Emphasis> to know what was causing all this commotion!"

They want to tell me something, I just know it!"

90,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_ESUMIYAN_000_055","...A child? Out here? By your description the mother may be a hunter, but I am curious as to her choice of hunting ground..."
91,"TEXT_JOBWHM601_02414_SYLPHIE_000_056","...Could it be <Emphasis>their</Emphasis> fear which has the elementals so upset? In any case, it seems the answer to that has run off into the brush."
