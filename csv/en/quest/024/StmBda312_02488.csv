63,"TEXT_STMBDA312_02488_ALISAIE_000_033","Afterwards, the other two join them there, and together we make a stand. With our numbers, it's not feasible to do anything more complicated, I think."

80,"TEXT_STMBDA312_02488_ALISAIE_000_080","<pant> <pant> That...that was not part of the plan! A Kojin primal was most definitely not part of the plan!"
81,"TEXT_STMBDA312_02488_ALISAIE_000_081","...Though I am sure there is a perfectly logical explanation involving the aether stored in the treasures and the religious fervor with which the Kojin guard them. Or something. <sigh> A pity Alphinaud isn't here to provide it."
82,"TEXT_STMBDA312_02488_ALISAIE_000_082","And just when I thought our fortunes had changed. I swear, if Soroban and his people knew this might happen..."
83,"TEXT_STMBDA312_02488_ALISAIE_000_083","...No, somehow I doubt that. Even the Red seemed surprised by what happened."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA312_02488_ALISAIE_000_084","All rises and falls at the whim of capricious fortune, does it? Then the same goes for him. We have to defeat that primal!"
