49,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_MNAAGO_000_010","Right. I believe we've rested long enough. We should resume our journey before someone notices their missing patrol."
50,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_ALISAIE_000_020","More soldiers? I didn't think they'd come this far west, but better to be safe than sorry..."
51,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_MNAAGO_000_030","...We're clear. Only Alliance patrols ahead."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_MNAAGO_000_031","You said the forces at Castrum Oriens were under the command of Flame General Raubahn Aldynn, did you not?"
53,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_MNAAGO_000_032","By Rhalgr! The Bull of Ala Mhigo himself! I never dreamed I'd have a chance to meet the legend..."
54,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_PIPIN_100_030","I returned from a survey of the Wall but a moment ago. We have yet to recover Papalymo's personal effects, I am sorry to say, but you may rest assured that we will notify you and yours the moment we do."
55,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_PIPIN_000_033","Our scouts recently informed me of an interesting development at Castellum Velodyna. Namely, the arrival of a shipment rumored to have come from the research and development facilities near the capital, containing prototype magitek armor."
56,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_PIPIN_000_034",""
57,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_PIPIN_000_035","It is our assessment that this armor is to be field-tested here, most likely against Alliance forces. Mayhap before the day is out."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_MNAAGO_000_036","Damn it all, more magitek weapons? That's the last thing we need!"
59,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_PIPIN_000_037","Your concern is not unwarranted, but we needn't despair just yet. The shipment is thought to have contained a single heavy unit and one or two support units. With a well-laid ambush, we are confident we can destroy them all, hindering their development and delaying future deployment."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_RAUBAHN_000_038","And should we carry this out as a joint endeavor with the Resistance, they will have their rallying cry."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_MNAAGO_000_039","It would mean dropping all pretense about the Alliance not wanting to go to war with the Empire...but you'd have a lot more folk willing to stand up and fight if they knew they weren't alone. And you were going to have to do it eventually anyway."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_PIPIN_000_040","Exactly. And so what I propose is simple: we harry their patrols to bait them into bringing their prototype weapons to East End, where our Resistance allies will take them from behind."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_RAUBAHN_000_041","Simple indeed, and well within our capabilities. I see no reason to delay, especially if a field test is imminent. What say you?"
64,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_MNAAGO_000_042","Assuming the vice marshal's intelligence is accurate, I agree with his assessment and fully support his plan. I shall notify my comrades at once."
65,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_PIPIN_000_043","Understood. I shall have one of my men bring you the details of the plan anon."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA112_02452_ALISAIE_000_044","And we for our part will be fighting with the Alliance, yes? I somehow doubt you were intending to sit this one out."
