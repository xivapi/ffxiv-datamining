56,"TEXT_STMBDA311_02487_LYSE_000_042","So...about the Red Kojin. You said there was a way to make them retreat into their shells? Are you ready to tell us now?"

64,"TEXT_STMBDA311_02487_BUNCHIN_000_050","Were the vault to be attacked, their response would by necessity be immediate. Kojin would be summoned from malms around to defend their treasures."

73,"TEXT_STMBDA311_02487_SOROBAN_000_059","The Magatama has chosen you to bear it to its brothers. Had it not, you would never have found it. And we would not be having this conversation."

79,"TEXT_STMBDA311_02487_ALISAIE_000_080","Right, then. I am not normally in the habit of sneaking into heavily guarded treasure vaults, but if this is the only way to convince the Confederacy to act, then so be it."
80,"TEXT_STMBDA311_02487_ALISAIE_000_081","We should be prepared for a fight. The bigger the better. The kind where you'll wish you had seven of your most battle-hardened friends at your side..."
