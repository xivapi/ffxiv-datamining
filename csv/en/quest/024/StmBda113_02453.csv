1,"TEXT_STMBDA113_02453_SEQ_01","Having resolved to carry out Vice Marshal Tarupin's plan to destroy prototype magitek weapons, General Aldynn is eager to begin at once. He bids you lie in wait for an imperial patrol near Castrum Oriens and slaughter the soldiers in order to goad the Garleans into a response."
2,"TEXT_STMBDA113_02453_SEQ_02","The trap has been baited with dead imperials. Raubahn and the others are already in position, waiting for you and the prototype weapons to arrive."
3,"TEXT_STMBDA113_02453_SEQ_03","The imperial officer charged with overseeing the field testing of the prototype magitek weapons is none other than Grynewaht, the brutish Roegadyn whom you faced on the Carteneau Flats. Needless to say, he is surprised to see you in Gyr Abania, but eager to seize the opportunity for revenge."
4,"TEXT_STMBDA113_02453_SEQ_04","Though Grynewaht sends wave after wave of imperial soldiers and magitek against you and your comrades, it is not enough. As the smoldering wreck of his beloved weapon belches smoke into the sky, the imperial officer flees, leaving the combined force of Alliance regulars and Resistance fighters to celebrate a momentous victory."
5,"TEXT_STMBDA113_02453_SEQ_05","The operation is a resounding success. Not only were the imperials humiliated and their magitek destroyed, but your allies suffered no casualties in the process. Thoroughly satisfied with this outcome, Commander Kemp and General Aldynn exchange a few words before withdrawing to their respective headquarters."
