58,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_YSHTOLA_000_045","On your guard. The imperials know these lands better than we."

60,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_ALPHINAUD_000_055","They call it East End because it marks the end of the Black Shroud. Note the sparser vegetation."

67,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_091","You're wondering about the tower to the south?"
68,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_092","It's part of Castellum Velodyna. That's what the imperials decided to call the old bridge after they fortified it."

77,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_123","Good eye, Y'shtola!"
78,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_ALPHINAUD_000_124","I take it they have a talented mage in their ranks─or mayhap an artificer trained in the modification of glamour prisms...?"
79,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_125","Something like that. The important thing is that it fools the Garleans."
80,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_126","Oh, before we go in─I don't know if Tataru told you, but my friend Naago, the messenger who came to the Rising Stones, is a member of this faction."
81,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_127","So they know us, and they shouldn't attack us on sight. That said, they can be a bit jumpy, so let me lead the way, and, uh...don't go reaching for your weapons or anything."
82,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_128","And with a sprinkle of demasking dust, all is laid bare!"
83,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_ALPHINAUD_000_130","Seeing it now, I feel rather foolish for not having deduced it earlier."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_131","All clear! Let's go, let's go!"
85,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_YSHTOLA_000_132","Impressive or no, twenty years is a long time for even so complex a glamour to escape the Empire's notice..."
86,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_ALISAIE_000_133","I suppose you could disguise almost anything with a glamour prism, if you really wanted to. Have you ever used one? Why am I asking─<Emphasis>of course</Emphasis> you haven't."
87,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_KRILE_000_134","Let us pray that they are amenable to our proposal. United, we stand to accomplish so much more..."

89,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_YSHTOLA_000_145","Fascinating... A massive, nigh-imperceptible glamour encompassing the entire valley... I see now how the settlement was able to escape the watchful eyes of imperial airships."
90,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_KRILE_000_150","Ordinarily, I'd shudder at the thought of armed rebels trampling about in an ancient temple of immense historical importance─but Rhalgr <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> the breaker of worlds, so it seems rather appropriate, if anything."
91,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_ALPHINAUD_000_155","This temple was once home to the Fist of Rhalgr, as I recall. Yes...there is no mistaking that statue."
92,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_LYSE_000_160","It's good to see Naago up and moving again. I wasn't there when she headed home, so I naturally assumed she'd left too soon. Always overdoing it, that one."
93,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_MNAAGO_000_165","A pleasure to see you again─and Krile and Y'shtola, without whose help I might not be standing here today. At least, not so soon."
94,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_MEFFRID_000_170","Ho, so you really came. I never thought I'd see you here, but I'm glad. I'm glad..."
95,"TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_CONRAD_000_180","You'll forgive us our precautions, but we couldn't be sure who had crossed the barrier. We see you now for who you are, though─the Scions of the Seventh Dawn."
