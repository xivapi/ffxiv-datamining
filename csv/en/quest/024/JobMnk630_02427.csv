At D'zentsa's urging, he decides to strike out in the hope that inspiration will strike along the way. Your first stop is an old training ground for monks called Schism, situated in the Fringes."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK630_02427_SEQ_02","The visit to Schism does not avail Widargelt in his quest for a creed, but he forges on undeterred. Follow him to the village of Ala Gannha, where Professor Erik has gone ahead to scout."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK630_02427_SEQ_03","Arriving at the village, Widargelt witnesses a heated exchange between two villagers. The experience is the spark Widargelt needed, and he finally comes up with a fitting doctrine to guide the Fist of Rhalgr into a new age. With that, he is ready to proclaim the order's return to the world. As the foremost monk in the party, you have been tasked with performing a demonstration before the villagers. Let Widargelt know when you are ready to begin."

7,"TEXT_JOBMNK630_02427_SEQ_07","Your blistering strikes pave the way for Widargelt's words, and he gives an impassioned speech and wins over the gathered crowd. Speak with Widargelt to learn his mind on the result of this first showing."
8,"TEXT_JOBMNK630_02427_SEQ_08","In no small part due to your aid, Widargelt has taken a first momentous step towards reviving the Fist of Rhalgr. The monk will remain in Ala Gannha awhile to initiate interested villagers into the fundamentals of the faith. In the meantime, he bids you continue honing your skills, for they will doubtless be called upon again ere long.

※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 65."
