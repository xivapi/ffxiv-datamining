1,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_SEQ_01","Meffrid, whom you first met in Quarrymill what feels like a lifetime ago, tells you of the twists and turns his life has taken since─how he dissolved his unit of Resistance fighters in Gridania and resolved to return to Gyr Abania and join Conrad's people in Rhalgr's Reach. Having subsequently risen to a position of responsibility, he has been tasked with finding new recruits, and wishes to pay a visit to the village of Ala Gannha─Lyse's birthplace. Upon learning of this, she insists that she be allowed to accompany you, and Meffrid sees no reason to deny her."
2,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_SEQ_02","After being informed of your purpose, the sentry guarding the tunnel to the Peaks quickly removes the barricade. Meffrid bids you lead the way."
3,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_SEQ_03","As the glamour obscuring the tunnel to the Peaks dissolves, you find yourselves standing in the ruins of an old temple. Your comrades pause to consider their surroundings, and a frown darkens Meffrid's brow..."
4,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_SEQ_04","Lyse explains that the temple in whose shattered midst you now stand was razed not by the Garleans but by the mad king, Theodoric, in the chaos that preceded the imperial invasion. Noting the glamour which surrounds the ruins, Meffrid reminds you that there will be nothing to conceal your presence once you leave, and advises caution as you proceed east towards Ala Gannha."
5,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_SEQ_05","Far to the southeast, Lyse spies a colossal tower rivaling Castellum Velodyna. An unwelcome reminder of the Empire's suffocating presence, you make an effort to put it from your thoughts as you press on towards Ala Gannha."
6,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_SEQ_06","You arrive at the village of Ala Gannha at last, and outside its gates Meffrid explains why Conrad identified the settlement as a promising source of new recruits. Several youths hailing from Ala Gannha were said to have lost their lives at the Wall, and it is possible that others in the village may be sympathetic to the Resistance's cause. That said, openly broaching the subject would be unwise, given the risk of being overheard by imperial sympathizers..."

56,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_022","I'm impressed! Given everything you went on to accomplish, you'd be forgiven for forgetting all about your time in Quarrymill. Suffice it to say, we didn't forget about you, either─nor the lives you saved."
57,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_023","No, no, 'twas a lifetime ago. There is no need to apologize. But know that down in Quarrymill, we didn't forget about you─nor the lives you saved."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_024","As for me...I went to Little Ala Mhigo while Gallien was recovering. Gundobald was my former commander and an old friend, and I had a lot on my mind..."
59,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_025","In the end, I decided to disband our unit. I told the men to live their lives as they saw fit. Some chose to remain in Little Ala Mhigo, and others went to Ul'dah for work."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_026","But, as you can see, I chose to come back to Gyr Abania and join Conrad and the others."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_027","I've kept busy since then, ferrying people and provisions across the border and back. It's not been easy, but it's been fulfilling."

74,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_080","We've a glamour in place here too, as you may have noticed. So far as the imperials are concerned, this is naught more than a testament to the savage impulses of a lesser race..."
75,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_081","Remember, though: once we leave these ruins, we'll have no glamours to conceal us. The village is to the east; keep watch for patrols as we move."

81,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_LYSE_000_121","It feels strange coming home like this. I always imagined it would be... Oh, sorry. That has nothing to do with why we're here. We need recruits."
82,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_122","Aye, we do, but as I said back at the Reach, it's a little more complicated than just asking for volunteers these days."
83,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_123","As you know, we're shorthanded because many of our people were taken in by the Griffin's promises and went to the Wall, never to return. It wasn't just them, though─folks from all over, including some of my former comrades, answered his call to arms."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_124","As for why we came to this particular village... It's rumored that Ala Gannha lost a few youths as well."
85,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_125","If there's truth to that, then there could be others sympathetic to the cause. Then again, after the Griffin's betrayal, they may be suspicious of outsiders claiming allegiance to the Resistance─and rightfully so."
86,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_LYSE_000_126","So with all that in mind, how are we supposed to convince them to join? I mean, I knew it wouldn't be as simple as giving a speech in the village square─"
87,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_127","Not if you didn't want the place to be burned to the ground, no. You might as well piss in the viceroy's eye. We'll need to be a good deal more circumspect than that. You never know when an imperial spy is listening."
88,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_MEFFRID_000_128","We must speak with the elder first. I know for a fact he can be trusted. We'll listen to what he has to say and decide what to do after."
89,"TEXT_STMBDA121_02455_LYSE_000_129","Sounds like a plan! Let's hope there are still some brave men and women here willing to fight."
