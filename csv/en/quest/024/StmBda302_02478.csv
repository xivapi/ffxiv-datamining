50,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_GOSETSU_000_010","Doma's position on the Confederacy could be best described as one of “guarded acceptance.” They are pirates, aye, but they adhere to a code and are a stabilizing force in the Ruby Sea."

52,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_TANSUI_000_020","You wish to pay the Ruby Tithe, yes? With your...gil, perhaps? It is just as well. Foreign currencies are in demand these days."

55,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_TANSUI_000_023","...The sea has been quite tempestuous of late. I cannot say with confidence that you would reach your destination safely─unless you tripled it."

63,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_TANSUI_000_031","...Hm. A proposition. Your comrades strike me as a worthwhile investment. I would not hear men name me a cat before koban, so I shall consider their tithe paid─not for what they have done, but for what I expect they will do."
64,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_ALISAIE_000_032","I'm not sure what to make of that man, but at least the matter of our tithe is settled. For now."

73,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_GOSETSU_000_071","...Though now that I think on it, it is passing strange that he left without warning. Mayhap he did not wish to be seen by his Kojin brethren?"
74,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_GOSETSU_000_072","I doubt he thought to leave us behind, but nevertheless, it may be prudent to return to his ship. Or at least to the Confederate encampment."

76,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_ALISAIE_000_085","I am sure he has his reasons for his odd behavior...and I should like very much to hear them. Trust requires honesty."
77,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_GOSETSU_000_090","Hah! I told you he would not abandon us!"
78,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_SOROBAN_000_100","Oh, my friends! A thousand pardons! ...As you may have guessed, I was reluctant to be seen in your company by my Red brothers. Ours is a...complex relationship."
79,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_SOROBAN_000_101","I pray you do not misinterpret their actions as a reflection of our allegiances as a whole."
80,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_SOROBAN_000_102","You...you understand? Kami be praised! Too often are shell-less quick to judge all Kojin for the deeds of one."
81,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_SOROBAN_000_103","Right, then. Now that our business with Tansui is concluded, we can traverse the Ruby Sea without fear!"
