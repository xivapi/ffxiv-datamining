49,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_GISILBEHRT_000_001","As I said before, you won't get far without the Ala Mhigans' trust. And the best way to win that trust is to get a compatriot of theirs─someone they respect─to vouch for you."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_GISILBEHRT_000_002","Coin does the talking in Ul'dah, but the Ala Mhigans are bound by something far stronger, if not as tangible: a common purpose. That purpose is, of course, the liberation of their home from the Garleans."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_GISILBEHRT_000_003","Gundobald belongs to the Ala Mhigan Resistance, so your best bet would be someone who's part of the same crew. If you know any well-connected people, you might want to start by asking them."

53,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_MINFILIA_000_011","...I see. Given all that they have suffered, it is of little wonder the Ala Mhigan refugees have lost faith in their fellow man."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_MINFILIA_000_012","They have had their homeland taken from them, and for the past two decades have had to see it remain in the enemy's clutches."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_MINFILIA_000_013","To compound matters, none of the three city–states have the means to take in all those who were displaced. As a result, a great many Ala Mhigans now live on the margins of society, suffering poverty and discrimination."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_MINFILIA_000_014","<sigh> Would that more could be done to ease their hardships. I fear that nothing short of reclaiming their homeland would be a lasting solution."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSA510_00762_MINFILIA_000_015","But let us deal with one problem at a time. Returning to the matter of your investigation, it just so happens there is an Ala Mhigan native among the Scions. I should be pleased to introduce him to you."
