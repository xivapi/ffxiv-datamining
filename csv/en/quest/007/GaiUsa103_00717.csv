Why, if I were a sylph, I'd be beside myself with delight to see an adventurer sharing my culture with <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> own kind! Me? Of course I'd be happy to join─ow, ow!

56,"TEXT_GAIUSA103_00717_ZACHEUS_000_022","Gods help me! Are you supposed to be a sylph, or a lemur in heat? You'd best work on your greeting skills, lest you frighten the poor sylphs clear out of the Shroud."
