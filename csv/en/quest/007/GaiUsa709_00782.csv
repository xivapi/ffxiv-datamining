1,"TEXT_GAIUSA709_00782_SEQ_01","Gundobald has scarcely opened his mouth when the battered and bruised figure of Bertliana stumbles back into Little Ala Mhigo. Through choked sobs, she reveals that she was being held captive by the Corpse Brigade. Fearing that this incident may spur Wilred and the others to action, Gundobald bids you go to them and see that they do not do something they may later regret."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA709_00782_SEQ_02","To your dismay, it would seem that Wilred and his friends have already set their plan in motion. Hurry back to Gundobald and show him the blunt hunting knife and the Zanr'ak map you have found."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA709_00782_SEQ_03","It seems that Wilred and his friends have been plotting to summon Rhalgr. To this end, they seek to infiltrate an Amalj'aa stronghold and steal the beastmen's cache of crystals. Intercept Wilred and his conspirators to the east of Little Ala Mhigo before the unthinkable comes to pass."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSA709_00782_SEQ_04","Wilred's plan has come to naught, as have his hopes of reclaiming his homeland. Return to Little Ala Mhigo and speak with Gundobald."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSA709_00782_SEQ_05","Wilred reveals that it was the masked stranger who first prompted him and his friends to entertain the notion of summoning Rhalgr. But what did Lahabrea─if indeed it was he─hope to accomplish by putting great power in the hands of the unworthy?"
