1,"TEXT_GAIUSA603_00765_SEQ_01","One of Meffrid's men requires urgent treatment for a wound, but the residents of the hamlet refuse to lift a finger. You must prevail upon Albreda to convince them to aid him."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA603_00765_SEQ_02","Although her compatriot's life is in danger, Albreda cannot bring herself to disregard the will of the elementals. Instead, she bids you consult the hamlet's resident Hearer, a woman named Charline."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA603_00765_SEQ_03","Despite your earnest pleas, Charline does not relent; the will of the elementals is absolute, and there will be no succor for the Ala Mhigans. You sorely dread having to return to Meffrid with the unhappy tidings."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSA603_00765_SEQ_04","Meffrid is understandably displeased with the verdict, and uses some choice words to express his opinion of the elementals. Is there no other way to aid him and his people?"
