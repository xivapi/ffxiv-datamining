2,"TEXT_GAIUSA301_00733_SEQ_02","You learn from Baensyng that a Qiqirn merchant on Hawkers' Alley named Kyokyoroon may know something of Teteroon's whereabouts. Bring the trader a chicken egg to coax him into spilling the goods."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA301_00733_SEQ_03","After receiving the chicken egg, Kyokyoroon is more than happy to tell you that Teteroon has since moved on to barter his wares at a trading post elsewhere. However, he cannot recall where said trading post is, and instead directs you to a man named Wineburg at the Lominsan ferry docks, who he believes knows Teteroon's whereabouts."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSA301_00733_SEQ_04","Wineburg recalls only that Teteroon rode the ferry to Aleport, and nothing beyond that. Should you decide to continue your search there, he advises you to speak with a man named Ahldfoet."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSA301_00733_SEQ_05","According to Ahldfoet, Teteroon headed north into upper La Noscea, most likely in search of Memeroon's Trading Post. Proceed to the outpost and present Teteroon with his forgotten scarlet earring."
