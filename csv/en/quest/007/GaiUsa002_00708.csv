Before going there, however, stop off along the way at Fullflower Comb and pay your regards to Rosa Hawthorne."

53,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_005","Aye, your little bird sings true. No doubt you've heard that we're investigating the sylphs─that curious beast tribe that calls the depths of the Twelveswood home."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_006","The sylphs are, for the most part, a peaceable bunch─much to the delight of the Elder Seedseer, who has no desire to see her people embroiled in yet another fruitless war."

59,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_011","Do we strike at Ramuh, or leave the sylphs to their own ways? That is the question, yet I find myself lacking ample knowledge to arrive at an answer."
60,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_012","Opinions abound within Gridania, but to listen only to one's own is among the greatest mistakes a commander can make."
61,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_013","I would hear from the other side─the sylphs themselves─and seek an impartial party to serve as my liaison. That is where you Scions come in."
62,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_014","The sylphs of Little Solace remain untempered, and have held many a productive dialogue with our people. I would hear their candid thoughts on their tempered brethren."
63,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_015","That said, I urge you to exercise due caution. Sylphic tradition and etiquette bear little resemblance to our own. It would not do to have any cross-cultural <Emphasis>faux pas</Emphasis> get in the way of a productive parley."
64,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_VORSAILE_000_016","En route to Little Solace, you will come upon the Hawthorne Hut. Our officer stationed there can enlighten you as to how to win the sylphs' favor. May your expedition be a worthwhile one."
65,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_PAPALYMO_000_017","A friendly palaver with the sylphs? This should be a pleasant enough diversion."
66,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_PAPALYMO_000_018","The Hawthorne Hut, was it? Why, I believe the ferry departing from Westshore Pier should take us straight there."
67,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_YDA_000_019","A friendly palaver, indeed! I hope this will be as straightforward as you say, Papalymo."
68,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_MITAINIE_100_010","Aye, the ferry docked at the base of this hill will carry you across the lake to the East Shroud."

77,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_ROSA_000_032","There is one who goes by Amelain. He is a sentry at Josselin's Spire, but makes regular excursions to our hut. He's quite enamored of our honey and the tales of my husband, Rolfe. Though I've found him to be tight-lipped around those he's unfamiliar with."
78,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_ROSA_000_033","...Ooh! I know what we might try. Why don't you take a jar of fresh honey to him? I reckon you'll find him <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> than talkative then."
79,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_AMELAIN_000_040","Indeed, I am Amelain of the Twin Adder. Your face is unfamiliar to─hm? You have a present for me, you say?"

82,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_AMELAIN_000_043","A-Ahem... Forgive me. You have come to discuss not honey, but sylphs. For all their whimsy, they are a wary lot. Particularly since the Empire has come to the Shroud..."
83,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_AMELAIN_000_044","Earn their trust, however, and they're as friendly as any folk. They have their quirks, but so do we all, no?"
84,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_AMELAIN_000_045","Would you know more, you'd do well to speak to Rosa's husband here, Rolfe. He's <Emphasis>forgotten</Emphasis> more about the sylphs than I'll ever know."
85,"TEXT_GAIUSA002_00708_POP_MESSAGE_000","A deafening buzzing assaults your ears!"
