1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_01","Q'yantaa wants to try one more time to convince Hudde to join up with her, and enlists your help to go looking for him. She rushes off to the northeast. Go after her in search of any clues of Hudde's whereabouts."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_02","There are even fewer Dravanian lilies blooming than the first time you picked them. Q'yantaa rushes to the northwest, as if she had caught the scent of a certain someone. Follow her deeper into the forest and see if her instincts were correct."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_03","You follow along Hudde's trail and come upon a single petal from a Dravanian lily. Q'yantaa proceeds further into the forest, certain that Hudde is not far ahead. Follow on her heels before she abandons you in her eagerness."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_04","Q'yantaa's tracking skills bring you to a recently abandoned camp. The novice hunter seems convinced that it was none other than Hudde who camped there, and ventures deeper into the woods. Follow her to see where this hunt will end."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_05","Among some dragon-infested ruins you find a Dravanian lily placed in front of a pile of rubble. Q'yantaa seems confused as to why such flowers would be placed here, and bids you investigate the lily for clues."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_06","Your inspection of the Dravanian lily is interrupted by Hudde, who is surprised that Q'yantaa was able to track him down despite the efforts he made to hide his tracks. However, he remains adamant that Q'yantaa is unfit to be his partner. After she prods him for an explanation, Hudde relates to you the tragic story of his previous partner, who died at these selfsame ruins during a routine hunt. After Hudde finishes his tale, Q'yantaa restates her desire to learn the ways of hunting under Hudde's tutelage, and ensures him that she will not meet the same fate as Hudde's previous partner. Hudde, moved by the strength of her conviction, finally agrees to take her under his wing, but warns that being his partner will be far from easy. Hudde and Q'yantaa return to Tailfeather to make preparations for their first hunt together. Bring news of this new partnership to Loupard."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_07","Loupard is overjoyed at the good news, and is confident that the pairing is beneficial for both hunters. Q'yantaa will soon begin her journey to become one of the realm's great chocobo hunters, and Hudde will finally be able to leave behind his tragic past."
