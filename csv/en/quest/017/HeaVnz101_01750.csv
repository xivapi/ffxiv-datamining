1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ101_01750_SEQ_01","As Bohemondas tells it, the knights of Ishgard plan to make his former home into a military encampment. This has upset Bohemondas greatly, made worse by the fact that his son has enlisted to help. He asks that should you see him, you present him with two choices: return to his family or forfeit them for good. Travel to Falcon's Nest and relay Bohemondas's message to his son."
