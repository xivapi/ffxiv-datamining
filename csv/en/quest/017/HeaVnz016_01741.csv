1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ016_01741_SEQ_01","Gildon continues his quest to revitalize the spirit of Camp Cloudtop. To achieve this goal, he means to slay a dragon together with his men. This plan will fall through, however, if no dragons can be found in the area. Still waiting to be relieved from sentry duty, he asks that you gather information from the guards about Camp Cloudtop. Speak with the guards, then venture off in search of his prey."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ016_01741_SEQ_02","You speak with the men standing guard about Camp Cloudtop. While none have seen leathery hide nor tail of dragons, one guard suspects they are being watched as they continue repairs of the <Emphasis>Protector</Emphasis>. Search the area for what may be monitoring the camp and prepare yourself for the worst."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ016_01741_SEQ_03","While hunting for dragons, you find a Vanu atop a cliff with a clear view of Camp Cloudtop. The Vanu engages you, but is no match for your long-proven skill in combat. Report back to Gildon and tell him of your findings."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ016_01741_SEQ_04","You tell Gildon of the Vanu, but he is disappointed rather than surprised. Uninterested in the threat of Vanu, he continues his search for a way to motivate his men."
