1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ112_01761_SEQ_01","In light of how easily you dispatched the rheums he previously tasked you with, Jantellot proposes that you hunt down some actual dragons this time. Archaeornis make up the vanguard of the Dravanian Horde, and a number of them roam the snowdrifts to the north of the camp, near Banepool. Jantellot tells you to find and slay three of these scaly, feathered beasts."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ112_01761_SEQ_02","With relative ease, you seek out and slay three archaeornis. Return to the Convictory and let Jantellot know that you did not shirk from this challenge."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ112_01761_SEQ_03","Impressed by the efficiency with which you slew your quarry, Jantellot explains that you would be more than welcome as a member of the Convictors, should you wish to join. They are always in need of more good men and women."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ112_01761_JANTELLOT_000_001","If you want to try your hand at it yourself, I suggest you start with some archaeornis. They are great, feathered scalekin monsters and they form part of the Horde's vanguard."

54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ112_01761_JANTELLOT_000_032","Many Ishgardians think we nobles at the Convictory are simply here out of foppery and whim. They scarce understand the risks we take defending Ishgard from the Horde. But I feel perhaps that you understand... If ever you decide you want to join the Convictors, you need but say the word!"
