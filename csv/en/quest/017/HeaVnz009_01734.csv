49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_001","The village here grew, years ago, around the barracks housing the Ishgardian scouting forces. It may have been a small village, but it had a long and rich history."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_002","Being so close to the Dravanian border, it had its fair share of legend and wisdom passed down from generation to generation."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_003","But after the Calamity─and the freezing winds it brought─the whole village was lost to the ice."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_004","Thanks to House Dzemael, the fortress's reconstruction is progressing rapidly. But the village─and all the belongings left behind in the Calamity's aftermath─still lies deep beneath the snow. I'd wager that feather ornament you found was previously dug up around here."

57,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_021","Maybe you really know how I feel. Maybe you're just helping an old man out of pity. Whichever it is, I still owe you my thanks."
58,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_022","I've never been happier than when they first started talking about rebuilding Falcon's Nest. I thought I'd finally have the old village back."
59,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_023","Of course, the Holy See wasn't interested in the village at all. They just wanted their fortress. And now it's bigger and grander than ever before."
60,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_024","The Falcon's Nest I knew─that small village I grew up in─it's been lying under all this snow ever since the Calamity."
61,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_025","All the villagers who could never return home─they've all had to move to the capital... It's for them that I'm still digging through all this snow, trying to recover that lost history."
