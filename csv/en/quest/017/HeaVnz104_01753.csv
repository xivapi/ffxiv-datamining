The remains of those who fell in combat rest peacefully at the bottom of the lake, but gelati now wander its surface, sullying their memory and marring the lake's beauty. He bids you slay these disrespectful monsters."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ104_01753_SEQ_02","You slay the gelati as requested. Let the knight know that the resting place of his brothers-in-arms is a little bit more tranquil now."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ104_01753_SEQ_03","The old veteran thanks you for your work. Without the gelati obscuring his vision, the great lake surrounding the Dusk Vigil once more appears like it did in the days of his youth."
