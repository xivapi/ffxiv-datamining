2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ216_01785_SEQ_02","At Mare's Oath, you find two lifelike dragon statues, which may pass for living creatures to a drunk. Return to Tailfeather and report your discovery to Remaclon."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ216_01785_REMACLON_000_001","That's right, <Emphasis>dragons</Emphasis>! Two of them, with great big wings and fire in their eyes. I ran straight home at the sight of them. My memory's a bit hazy, but if it really <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> dragons I seen, we could all be in danger. I can't very well go back there by myself, but, well...
I almost hate to ask, but do you think you could traipse on over to the ruins for me? I'll mark down the area I was wanderin' around in on your map."

...Statues, you say!? Ugh, maybe I should go easier on the ale..."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ216_01785_REMACLON_000_031","They say those ruins up north were built by heretics. Even just goin' near them might have people doubtin' your allegiances."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ216_01785_REMACLON_000_032","Well, since there's no <Emphasis>real</Emphasis> dragons, I guess there ain't nothin' to worry about! Now that I know what sort of place it is, I'll be sure to give it a wide berth."
