1,"TEXT_JOBMCH500_01703_SEQ_01","Stephanivien, exultant that the day of the tourney is at hand, would have you call your colleagues back to the manufactory. Head outside the workshop, and speak with Joye."
2,"TEXT_JOBMCH500_01703_SEQ_02","You approach Joye, only to find her frantic at the discovery of a crate full of broken firearms. After you soothe her panic somewhat, she is able to tell you where Rostnsthal is to be found. Head towards the other side of the workshop, and seek out the master of marksmanship."
3,"TEXT_JOBMCH500_01703_SEQ_03","Rostnsthal is furious to hear of the smashed weapons, and bids you scour the area around the manufactory for the culprit's accomplices. Search Foundation for lingering miscreants, and scare them away using Slug Shot.

When Slug Shot is unavailable, Heated Slug Shot may be used instead."

5,"TEXT_JOBMCH500_01703_SEQ_05","No sooner have you described your encounters to Stephanivien when a nearby explosion rocks the workshop. Head outside and speak with Joye."
6,"TEXT_JOBMCH500_01703_SEQ_06","Joye mournfully shares her discovery of the destroyed turrets, but it seems that Stephanivien is not yet ready to surrender House Haillenarte's place in the tourney. The chief machinist vows to replace the damaged weaponry, and sends your colleagues ahead to put on a show of confidence. Join Stephanivien in the manufactory, and discuss what must be done to overcome this latest disaster."
7,"TEXT_JOBMCH500_01703_SEQ_07","In the face of repeated attacks against the workshop and your dwindling chances of success, Stephanivien finds himself ever more dependent upon the brilliance of a talented few─namely you and Joye. But will skill alone be enough to balance the loss of so much machinist weaponry...?"
