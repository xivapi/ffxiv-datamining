1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_SEQ_01","Virgeaume has asked you to check on the two traps he set up: one is upstream of the Whilom River and the other lies to the east of Tailfeather. Check if the chocobo traps have caught anything."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_SEQ_02","It appears the chocobos that Virgeaume had intended to ensnare made off with the bait without triggering the traps. Bring him the sad news."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_SEQ_03","Although Virgeaume mourns the loss of his bait, he is surprised that the birds─and you─were able to avoid his cleverly dug pitfalls."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_VIRGEAUME_000_001","There are two of them: one upstream of the Whilom River and one out to the east of Tailfeather. All you really need to do is head out there to see if they've caught anything."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_VIRGEAUME_000_010","Go upstream of the Whilom River for the first trap, and out east of Tailfeather for the second. Let me know if they've caught anything."

54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_VIRGEAUME_000_041","I half expected that would happen. That's why I dug pits near the traps in hopes of catching one off guard. Ah, sorry...guess I forgot to mention that part. Looks like both you and the chocobos managed to get past them on your own, though!"
55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_VIRGEAUME_000_042","Truth be told, this isn't the first time I've been outwitted by a chocobo. I've got more trap designs in the works, and I plan to test them out soon. Stop by again if you feel like joining in."
