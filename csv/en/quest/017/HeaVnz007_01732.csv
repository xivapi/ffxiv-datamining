1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ007_01732_SEQ_01","Noirterel has asked you to gather meat for him. Kill three steinbocks and obtain their meat."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ007_01732_SEQ_02","You slay the steinbocks and butcher their carcasses. Return to Noirterel with the meat."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ007_01732_SEQ_03","Noirterel explains that, as a key strategic location, Falcon's Nest must withstand some of the Horde's most vicious attacks. These onslaughts take the form of both direct, frontal assaults and long, drawn-out sieges. The meat you recovered will be frozen and stored for use as emergency rations in the event that supply lines are severed."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ007_01732_NOIRTEREL_000_002","It's horrible stuff. It's tough like boot leather and it tastes like it too. But we can't afford to be picky around here─especially not with our food stores looking the way they do."
