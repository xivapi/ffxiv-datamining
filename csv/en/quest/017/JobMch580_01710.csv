1,"TEXT_JOBMCH580_01710_SEQ_01","Stephanivien seems confused by the Temple Knights' seeming inertia─a confusion that is compounded by the sudden arrival of a smirking Tedalgrinche. The nobleman casually explains how the manufactory's evidence against him was overturned, and goes on to deliver an ultimatum to the chief machinist: slay the dragon Veri Selen, or be judged guilty by the Holy See. Realizing that to face the immense beast is akin to suicide, Rostnsthal offers to spare the machinists by turning himself in for the crime of insurrection. Speak with Stephanivien and discuss what can be done."

Head to Ok' Vundu Vana in the Sea of Clouds, and acquire clear lightning crystals for the chief machinist's latest marvel."
