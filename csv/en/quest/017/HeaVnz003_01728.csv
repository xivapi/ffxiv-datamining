1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ003_01728_SEQ_01","A regular of the Forgotten Knight has fallen on hard times, and Gibrillont is counting on a bottle of mulled wine to grant him a few moments of solace. Take the bottle that Gibrillont has given you to the bibulous bloke in the basement."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ003_01728_SEQ_02","You hand over the wine to the bibulous bloke, who still seems to be reeling at the recent course of events in his life. He tells you the lady of the noble house he served was accused of heresy, leading to a series of events that ultimately ruined the family and cost him his employment. But rather than drown his sorrows in wine, he asks that you take the bottle to his former lord, as a token of appreciation for allowing him to serve the family. Deliver the bottle of mulled wine to the title-stripped lord, who you are like to find near the airship landing."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ003_01728_SEQ_03","You see the bottle of wine into the hands of the title-stripped noble. While he is touched at his former knight's concern, he has already resigned himself to the judgment of Halone, and has prepared to take an airship to parts unknown with his son. However, his son is missing, and he is starting to worry. He asks that you find his son before they are late for the flight."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ003_01728_SEQ_04","You find the former noble's son standing not far from the Supreme Sacred Tribunal, where his mother stood trial. His father vowed to do all within his power to save the boy's mother and see justice served. Unfortunately, justice was not what they expected it to be. As the boy turns to leave for the airship landing, he cannot help but wish there was more he could have done to protect his mother."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ003_01728_GIBRILLONT_000_010","A small gesture, I know, but he'll appreciate it. And between you and me, I think he could use a sympathetic ear right about now."

Rather than play the drunken fool, I would like to make a gift of this to my lord. Surely this pain I bear is nothing next to his─completely unaware that his wife had committed such heinous crimes.
He is a good man. He deserves better, but this is all I can offer him now."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ003_01728_TEARFILLEDSOLDIER01728_000_025","I am loath to impose upon your kindness further, but could you take this to him in my place? To let him see me in my current state would be disgraceful. I imagine he is still at the airship landing in the Pillars."
