The chief machinist plans to create yet another new device, but explains that the process will be much expedited with the acquisition of existing magitek components. Infiltrate Castrum Centri in Mor Dhona, and salvage warmachina parts from the crates found around the imperial base."

3,"TEXT_JOBMCH520_01706_SEQ_03","Stephanivien eagerly accepts the magitek components. Before returning to his inventing, however, he tells you of the troubles Celestaux has encountered in his efforts to locate Joye. It would seem that someone has paid good coin to cover the ex-machinist's trail out of Ishgard. Head into the Brume, and try questioning its inhabitants as to the whereabouts of Joye's father instead."
4,"TEXT_JOBMCH520_01706_SEQ_04","You have spoken to several residents of the Brume, and learned several vital snippets of information. Return to the Skysteel Manufactory, and share your findings with Stephanivien."
5,"TEXT_JOBMCH520_01706_SEQ_05","After considering the information you uncovered in the Brume, Stephanivien is convinced that Joye will be found in Falcon's Nest. Travel to the settlement in the Coerthas western highlands, and cast your gaze about for the elusive ex-machinist."
6,"TEXT_JOBMCH520_01706_SEQ_06","You succeed in locating Joye in Falcon's Nest, but Stephanivien is unable to convince the young lady to return to her former position in the workshop. Return to the Skysteel Manufactory and console the chief machinist."
7,"TEXT_JOBMCH520_01706_SEQ_07","Celestaux shares his suspicion that Joye's father is being held against his will, thus forcing Joye's decision to abandon her employment in Ishgard. Stephanivien, however, refuses to meddle further in his former employee's affairs, choosing instead to focus on his preparations for the operation with House Dzemael. Accept the chief machinist's latest invention, and continue improving your skills that you might compensate for the workshop's dwindling ranks.

※The next machinist quest will be available from Stephanivien upon reaching level 54."
