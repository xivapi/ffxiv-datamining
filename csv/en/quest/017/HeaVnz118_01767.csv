2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ118_01767_SEQ_02","You fill the bottle with water from the spring. Return it to Jantellot so that he might regain his strength."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ118_01767_SEQ_03","You provide Jantellot with the spring's healing water. He explains that, while the Convictory's supplies─particularly of healing potions─are low, the water you retrieved is more effective than the strongest of potions...or so some people say."
