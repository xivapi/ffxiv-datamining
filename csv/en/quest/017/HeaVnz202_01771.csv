You look right fierce enough to get the information outta 'em. It's a simple job that'll earn you some coin─can't rightly say no to that!"

Wasn't a damn thing we could do about it. If we're goin' to keep on in this area, we'll need some extra hands. You tell the chief that."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ202_01771_MARCECHAMP_000_030","So they've all got issues...but none of 'em thought to ask me for help. Do they think I'll bite off their heads or somethin'!?"

Say...since you've already struck up an acquaintance with my people an' all, maybe you'd be willin' to lend 'em a hand? Seems they talk to you of their troubles readily enough."
