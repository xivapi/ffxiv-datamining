1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ220_01789_SEQ_01","The Vath Hungerer explains that the nearby meliae interfere with the Vath's hunting and gathering. She asks you to kill four of the monsters, lest her tribe go hungry, unable to collect food."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ220_01789_SEQ_02","You fell the meliae as requested. Return to the Hungerer with the good news."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ220_01789_SEQ_03","The Hungerer tells you that, to the Vath, fighting is simply a means to gather food. The idea of attacking something inedible is unpalatable to them. Though, from the way they talk, it is clear they have tried to eat meliae before."
