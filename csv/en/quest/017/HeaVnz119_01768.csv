1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ119_01768_SEQ_01","Luciae sent a messenger out on a mission near Riversmeet. He should have returned long ago, but there is still no sign of him. Head out after him and find out what happened."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ119_01768_SEQ_02","You find the missing man near Riversmeet as expected. He completed his mission but was attacked by a yeti and thrown from his chocobo. The steed saved his life by bravely drawing the beast away, but has not been seen since. The messenger returns to base to report to Luciae, but asks you to track down his beloved chocobo, Amberbeak, fearing for his safety."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ119_01768_SEQ_03","You find the chocobo─or rather, its corpse. You pluck a feather from its slowly freezing body, a token from the fallen bird. Take the feather back to the Convictory and break the grim news to Amberbeak's fretting owner."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ119_01768_SEQ_04","The hope fades from the man's eyes as you hand him the feather. He is heartbroken to have lost his loyal companion, but appreciates you retrieving this memento of his cherished steed."
