2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_SEQ_02","You have found the thieves and dealt with them. Return the stolen crate to Auriaune at Falcon's Nest."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_SEQ_03","Auriaune thanks you for recovering the stolen goods. She also finds something curious within the crate: a feather ornament. She is able to identify it as being from the Sixth Astral Era, but can tell no more than that. She asks you to take it to Sigan, a local man who collects relics from that period."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_SEQ_04","Sigan thanks you for the ornament. He points out that they were a common sight in Falcon's Nest─before the Calamity, that is."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_001","The damage from the Calamity─and the freezing winds it brought with it─was tremendous. Even the rats fled, driven out by the cold."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_002","With the impostor Guillaime dealt with, we can move forward with the rebuilding of the fortifications. I'm truly delighted─and proud─to be a part of it. But it's no simple task."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_003","The heretic's various supporters are obviously still a major concern. And the High Houses still have their squabbles and their disputes with the citizenry. Frankly, there's no end to the difficulties we face."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_004","Just yesterday, some valuable supplies went missing─stolen from within this very fortress, right beneath our noses!"
53,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_005","We've no leads, and we don't have the resources to scour the highlands looking for these supplies. But if you happen to see a group of suspicious-looking fellows carrying a large crate with them, it may well be our stolen goods. Please recover them for us."

56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_031","Yes, yes! This is the very crate that was stolen. This looks very much like the heretics' handiwork."
57,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_032","...But there's something in here that shouldn't be. A feather ornament? Whatever could it mean...?"
58,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_033","It looks like a type of ornament that was popular in Falcon's Nest before the Calamity. This sort of thing is of no use to us here─a mere decorative trinket. But there is someone who might be interested in it."
59,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_034","There's a humorless old man named Sigan who collects antiques from the small mountain village that used to be here at Falcon's Nest. I'm sure he'd love to take a look at something like this. Do you think you could do me a favor and take it to him?"
60,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_043","Have you taken that ornament to Sigan yet?"

62,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_SIGAN_000_041","Ah, you used to see these all the time before the Calamity─back before Falcon's Nest ended up looking like this."
63,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_SIGAN_000_042","This brings back some memories. You say it was left with supplies stolen by the heretics? ...Well, thank you, in any case."
