Upon the great beast's demise, the grateful noble at last recognizes machinistry's worth, and promises to work alongside the manufactory chief in building a place for the machinists in Ishgard. Return to the Skysteel Manufactory, and share this triumph with Stephanivien."

Take the lessons you have learned in the manufactory, and do your part in spreading the machinist trade to the farthest reaches of Eorzea!

※The next machinist quest will be available from Stephanivien once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"
