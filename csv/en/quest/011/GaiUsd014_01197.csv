2,"TEXT_GAIUSD014_01197_SEQ_02","The disappearance of the Immortal Flames scouting parties deployed into Zahar'ak suggests that Ifrit once more rages within the Bowl of Embers.

7,"TEXT_GAIUSD014_01197_SEQ_07","You deliver the ritual object to Urianger and describe your encounter with the shadowy Ascians. The Elezen laments that while he is occupied with uncovering a more permanent solution to the primal threat, there is no recourse but to continue slaying the beastman deities whenever they arise. It appears, however, that he may have a means to aid you in this increasingly dangerous endeavor."

71,"TEXT_GAIUSD014_01197_URIANGER_000_041","Ah, yes, it doth most closely resemble the others in form, and, I daresay, in function. The bone is, of course, Amalj'aa in origin."

75,"TEXT_GAIUSD014_01197_URIANGER_000_044","Each ritual object thou didst recover is a manner of focus─a tool fashioned from the bones of a willing worshiper. These foci contained the vast aetheric power generated by the fervent prayers of a beastman zealot in the moment of his death...
This power was then poured into each primal during the rite of summoning, thus giving rise to the augmented avatar thou didst engage."
