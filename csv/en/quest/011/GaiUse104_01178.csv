2,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_02","Gazing upon the foul-smelling pugil carcasses is enough to deprive you of any lingering appetite. You can only hope that the gurangatch will regard them more favorably. Place the bait at the water's edge in gurangatch territory and find out if your quarry's tastes truly are so different from your own."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_03","The trap now set, you can but wait and hope. Retreat to a safe distance and bide your time."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_04","As if to confirm the fundamental differences between the palates of your respective species, the pugil carcasses prove irresistible to a truly gigantic gurangatch, which you duly slay. While you set about the nauseating task of scraping the creature's belly oil into a flask, you ponder what manner of individual first thought to use the secretions in a perfume... Push such irrelevant musings aside and deliver the fetid fruits of your labors to F'lhaminn in Wineport."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_05","F'lhaminn requires only a brief moment to finish her perfume. Her preparations complete, she agrees to accompany you and Alphinaud to Vesper Bay. Return to the Waking Sands and seek an audience with Minfilia."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_06","Upon seeing Alphinaud escort F'lhaminn into the solar, Minfilia rushes forward to embrace her long-lost mother, overjoyed to learn that reports of her death were indeed exaggerated. During their tearful reunion, Minfilia explains that her father was once a member of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, and that following his death in a tragic accident, F'lhaminn raised her as her own. After praising Minfilia for her victories over the Empire, F'lhaminn states that the Scions must leave Ul'dah behind if they are to continue their work. Agreeing at last to Alphinaud's proposal, a reinvigorated Minfilia declares that the order will quit Vesper Bay and establish a new headquarters in Revenant's Toll."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_FLHAMINN_000_001","I require pristine salamander oil to complete my perfume."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_FLHAMINN_000_002","Oil this pure can only be obtained from the belly of a gurangatch, a notoriously elusive species of wavekin native to Bronze Lake."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_FLHAMINN_000_003","Elusive, I say, yet no less sensible to the allure of the right bait. In this instance, that would be freshly slain mud pugils. Three placed at the water's edge should be sufficient to tempt any gurangatch lurking nearby."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_FLHAMINN_000_004","They are aggressive when startled, and will attack on sight. Yet given the ease with which you dispatched that goobbue, I doubt they will trouble you unduly."

78,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_MINFILIA_000_047","When I was yet a child, he brought me here to Ul'dah. The accident which claimed his life happened shortly after our arrival."
79,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_MINFILIA_000_048","It was Lhaminn who took care of me then. She raised me as her own─taught me everything I needed to know to survive."

82,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_MINFILIA_000_051","This cat's-eye was the first stone I unearthed. It wasn't much, of course, but I was exceedingly proud to have found it nonetheless."

But there I am at a loss. Why are you returning this to me? Is something amiss?"

85,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_FLHAMINN_000_054","You and your allies have accomplished more than I could ever have hoped. You have succeeded where I failed, and made me so <Emphasis>proud</Emphasis> that...that words fail me."

90,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_MINFILIA_000_059","Alphinaud. The time has come for the Scions to leave Vesper Bay."
