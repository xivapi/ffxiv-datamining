She has departed for Revenant's Toll, and bids you follow as soon as you are able. Travel to Mor Dhona, and speak with Tataru inside the Seventh Heaven to gain entrance to the Rising Stones."

The distant yet dependable Students of Baldesion are no longer responding to his messages. Fearing the worst, Minfilia bids Urianger do everything he can to determine the cause of their uncharacteristic silence. For the time being, however, the Scions have no choice but to continue their work without the aid of one of their closest allies."
