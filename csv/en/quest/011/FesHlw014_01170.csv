※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW014_01170_SEQ_01","The Impresario, pleased with your honest efforts on his troupe's behalf, has entrusted you with the most vital task of placing one final warding lantern in a dimly lit area of town. Speak once more to the shifty thespian to obtain the necessary supplies.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

4,"TEXT_FESHLW014_01170_SEQ_04","Upon lighting the final warding lantern, a curious voice speaks to you, raising doubts as to the true identity of the Impresario and his men, and encouraging you to seek the truth from the troupe's purported patrons. Begin your investigation by speaking to Storm Captain O'adenek at Maelstrom Command."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW014_01170_SEQ_05","O'adenek insists that the Maelstrom has had no dealings with the Impresario and his dubious band, saying that she hears they were personally summoned by the Yellowjackets. Seek the truth from Sundyrund at the Coral Tower."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW014_01170_SEQ_06","Sundyrund is adamant that the Yellowjackets know nothing of the Impresario and his troupe, saying that he heard that they were invited by the Adventurers' Guild. Make for the Drowning Wench and see what Baderon might know of the matter."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW014_01170_SEQ_07","Hearing your words, Baderon concludes that the Impresario is not who he claims to be. Use the sparkler he has given you to spook the dubious troupemaster into showing his true colors."
8,"TEXT_FESHLW014_01170_SEQ_08","Spooked clean out of his costume, the Impresario is revealed to be an actual imp. As he tells it, he and his monstrous minions cooked up their scheme in hopes for a return to the old days, when All Saints' Wake afforded an opportunity for his kind to frolic and purvey mischief in town. Assuring you that he means no harm, you agree to keep his secret. All told, this has proven to be an eventful All Saints' Wake─though the true identity of the disembodied voice that guided you to the truth remains cloaked in shadows..."
