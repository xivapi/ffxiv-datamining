Speak with Rammbroes when you are ready to assist in the Sons' mission to understand and preserve the potent technology of the fallen Allagan Empire."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_SEQ_03","According to Rammbroes, the entrance to the Crystal Tower is guarded by potent elemental defenses which will need to be circumvented before any expedition into the structure can be attempted. Cid's research suggests that the wrath of the elements can theoretically be reflected by crystals of sufficient clarity. Unfortunately, such flawless specimens are most likely to be found in the midst of the various beast tribe strongholds, and will not be had without a fight. It falls to you to obtain a flawless earth crystal from U'Ghamaro Mines in outer La Noscea, and a flawless water crystal from the Sapsa Spawning Grounds in western La Noscea by participating in the FATEs “Stopping the Shakes” and “Making Waves,” respectively."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_SEQ_04","You have wrested the flawless crystals from the clutches of the kobolds and the Sahagin. Deliver your prizes to Rammbroes where he awaits you at Saint Coinach's Find."

Obtain a flawless fire crystal from Zahar'ak in southern Thanalan, and a flawless wind crystal from Natalan in the Coerthas central highlands by participating in the FATEs “He's a Firestarter” and “The Storm Caller,” respectively."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_SEQ_06","You succeed in infiltrating the strongholds of the Amalj'aa and the Ixal, and escape with the beastmen's flawless fire and wind crystals. Deliver them both to Rammbroes at Saint Coinach's Find."
7,"TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_SEQ_07","Thanks to your daring forays into the beastmen's strongholds, the Sons of Saint Coinach now possess flawless crystals of each of the four elements. If they are to be relied upon to reflect the wrath of the tower's sentinels, however, the crystals must be cut and polished to exacting specifications. According to Rammbroes, this process calls for certain extraordinary materials. Clearly, much work remains to be done."
