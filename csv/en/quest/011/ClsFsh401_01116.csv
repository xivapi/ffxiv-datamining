1,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SEQ_01","A representative from the Brugaire Consortium has come to the Fishermen's Guild, drawn by your growing celebrity. Sisipu directs you to speak with the representative in person, who can enlighten you on the nature of the Consortium's request."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SEQ_02","In an effort to satisfy the needs of wealthy Ul'dahns, the Consortium seeks five raincallers, which are said to possess certain desirable properties. Raincallers can be fished out of Gridania's Jadeite Flood with stem borers, but only when rain falls, hence their name. Procure the fish and deliver them to Sybell."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SEQ_03","Sybell appears elated at receiving her raincallers, and at the prospect of seeing you again in future.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 45."

51,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SISIPU_000_003","I, for one, cannot, but perhaps you'll have something else to say when you speak with Sybell. She's waiting for you outside the guild."

55,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SYBELL_000_013","Keep an eye to the skies─you'll need the fish to be aroused, so that they'll bite at the bait. Stem borers are most effective, or so I am told."

62,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SYBELL_000_023","The elder males have been led to believe that ingesting the raincallers will endow them with...let us say “vigor.” No one knows whether it is true, and I don't personally care to find out."
63,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SYBELL_000_024","I only know that rich men will stop at nothing to recapture their former glory, and so these fish should fetch a fair price at market."
