1,"TEXT_GAIUSD004_01158_SEQ_01","As if on cue, the kobolds have succeeded in summoning Titan. According to Y'shtola, in his current incarnation, Titan now surpasses even Garuda in strength. Report to Maelstrom Command and speak with Commander Rhiki to learn how you might arrange a confrontation with the Lord of Crags."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD004_01158_SEQ_02","According to Commander Rhiki, a beastman aetheryte leading to Titan's domain, the Navel, has been discovered within U'Ghamaro Mines in outer La Noscea. Fight your way to the innermost depths of the kobold stronghold, and attune to the aetheryte."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSD004_01158_SEQ_03","You have successfully attuned yourself to the U'Ghamaro aetheryte, and the path to the Navel lies wide open. Assemble your stoutest adventuring comrades, and vanquish the Lord of Crags.

49,"TEXT_GAIUSD004_01158_YSHTOLA_000_001","It pains me to say that Titan is also returned, and with a vengeance. As was the case with his primal brethren, he is grown stronger than he was before."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSD004_01158_YSHTOLA_000_002","When I went about my investigation, all indications suggested that the kobolds were nowhere near ready to resume their summoning rites."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSD004_01158_YSHTOLA_000_006","A primal's might is determined by two factors: the amount of crystals it has gorged upon, and the fervor of its believers.

57,"TEXT_GAIUSD004_01158_YSHTOLA_000_009","But do not despair, for the Maelstrom has reportedly found another in its place. You will want to speak with Commander Rhiki at Maelstrom Command for the details."
