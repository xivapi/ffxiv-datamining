※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW023_01173_SEQ_01","Duly impressed with your efforts on his troupe's behalf, the Impresario would seek your aid with another All Saints' Wake tradition─the lighting of the traditional warding lanterns. Donning your costume, first speak to the shifty thespian and obtain a bomb digit for the task.

You have, no doubt, observed the warding lanterns about the streets─those that bear a striking resemblance to the mask I wear. This mask, in turn, was crafted in the likeness of the Great Gourd, the patron spirit of All Saints' Wake, who descends upon the realm but once a year..."

55,"TEXT_FESHLW023_01173_IMPA_000_019","I'd be wary of walking around like that if I were you, friend. The spirits of the dead walk the streets tonight, and they bear little fondness for the living..."
