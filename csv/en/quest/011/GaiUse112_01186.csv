2,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_SEQ_02","Upon returning to the Waking Sands, Alphinaud declares that preparations for the move to Mor Dhona have fallen behind. Demonstrating an almost Slafbornian eagerness to put you to work, he then bids you scour the headquarters for any packages labeled for shipment to Revenant's Toll. It would seem your report will have to wait."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_SEQ_03","A cursory search yields four labeled packages. Though an average <Sheet(Race,PlayerParameter(71),0)/> might feasibly struggle to carry them all, the same cannot be said of you. Bluntly, you have faced greater challenges. Take the packages to Tataru who is waiting outside."

We have a major crisis on our hands, you see─one which will demand your full attention for weeks if not months. I'm sorry, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. If you've made any other plans, you'll just have to cancel them."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_SLAFBORN_000_002","Anyway, your work here is done─for the time being, at least. Master Alphinaud has sent word that you are to report to him at the Waking Sands. I gather he wants to know how you've been getting on. Be sure to tell him how welcome we've made you feel, won't you?"
51,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_SLAFBORN_000_003","As much as I would like to impose upon you further, Alphinaud was insistent that you return to Vesper Bay at once."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_ALPHINAUD_000_010","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─you've returned. I trust they kept you busy in Revenant's Toll?"
53,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_ALPHINAUD_000_011","We have had nary a moment's rest since you departed. Despite our best efforts, however, we've begun to fall behind."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_ALPHINAUD_000_012","No matter. We shall soon make up the lost ground with you here to help us. Now, there are a number of packages which must needs be delivered to Revenant's Toll as a matter of urgency."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_ALPHINAUD_000_013","Don't give me that long-suffering look─I only require you to take them upstairs to Tataru. She will handle the rest.

56,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_ALPHINAUD_000_014","Of course I wish to hear your report, but you've caught me at an inopportune moment. I daresay I will have some time to talk when you have finished your little errand."
