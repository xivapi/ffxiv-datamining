Riding your bird is one thing; asking it to take hurts in your name is quite another. I will help train your chocobo, but on the promise that you will never unduly expose it to danger. Do I have your word?"

This simple-yet-effective methodology was developed by the Fortemps family, one of the foremost houses in Ishgard."

64,"TEXT_SUBFST911_01162_LUQUELOT_000_033","Ah, before I forget, I have one last parting gift: a saddlebag for your chocobo. Carrying gysahl greens about can be quite cumbersome, after all, and there should be sufficient room for your personal belongings should the need arise. I pray it serves you well on your travels."
