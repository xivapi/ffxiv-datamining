1,"TEXT_SUBSEA153_01144_SEQ_01","After the fireworks comes paperwork. S'nairoh has completed a report on the sordid incident of the hedgemoles. It falls upon you to deliver it to Commander Falkbryda at Camp Skull Valley."
2,"TEXT_SUBSEA153_01144_SEQ_02","The report is safely in the hands of Commander Falkbryda, whose steel-grey eyes appear to miss very little of the goings-on in Aleport. The docked pay and the hard words will, you hope, prompt S'nairoh to mend her ways."
