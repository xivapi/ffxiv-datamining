1,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_SEQ_01","T'laqa Tia has asked that you supply him with garjana wrasse for data collection purposes.

※Garjana wrasse can be fished from the Great Runoff using shrimp balls as bait.

※Minimum collectability rating for this delivery is 133. Delivering items with a rating of 313 or more will earn greater rewards."

62,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_011","So the rumors were true! Still, you could always fish off the island's coast. I reckon there wouldn't be much risk in that."
63,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_012","Anyhow, I'd like you to fish the same species that Professor Nele studied twenty years ago: to wit, the garjana wrasse."
64,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_100_012","According to the books the professor gave me, they live near the Great Runoff, and are known to enjoy nibbling on shrimp balls. And that should do it! Be safe out there, yes?"

68,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_020","Well, would you look at that wrasse! Splendid! I can scarcely wait to analyze it, that I might compare my findings with Professor Nele's from two decades ago!"
69,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_021","Dear me! What an impressive specimen! This should allow me to collect data as complete as Professor Nele's from two decades ago. I can't wait to compare my findings!"
70,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_030","Well, I daresay I've more than enough samples now. Pray wait for just a moment—I'm going to ask Professor Nele to take a look."
71,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_NELE_000_031","It's not every day that you ask after me, T'laqa. I trust this means that your research is coming along well?"
72,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_032","Better than I could have ever imagined! As a matter of fact, I was hoping to hear your thoughts on my latest findings."
73,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_033","Comparing my data with yours from twenty years ago, I can say with confidence that the concentration of aether in the area did indeed show an increase around the time of the Calamity. From these numbers, I would posit that smaller fish species in the area have increased in abundance severalfold!"
74,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_034","The garjana wrasse, in particular, is known for protecting itself from predators by creating disturbances in the surrounding aether. A population increase of such scale would undoubtedly result in a dramatic impact on its habitat."
75,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_035","Which would go a long way to explaining the countless shipwrecks. The sheer number of these fish would surely play havoc with ships' aether compasses."
76,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_NELE_000_036","Outstanding work, T'laqa! Of course, more data will be needed to prove your assertions as fact. Should it hold true, however, this could be a discovery of no small import."
77,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_NELE_000_037","Come to think of it, I remember you showing considerable interest in my research into the seas around Thavnair. What exactly was it that drew you to my work?"
78,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_038","Oh! It's just, well, I always found the figures somewhat...unnatural. Call it a hunch, but I couldn't help but feel like it warranted further research."
79,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_NELE_000_039","Ah, now <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> the true spirit of a scholar. Even the most epoch-making of discoveries often started from observation of a simple irregularity or curiosity."
80,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_NELE_000_040","With that intuition and power of observation, you're going to go places, T'laqa. I knew my faith in you was not misplaced."

82,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_NELE_000_042","Haha! Take care not to let it go to your head. Your potential will only be stifled if you allow yourself to be content with minor progress and faint praise."
83,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_043","O-Of course, Professor. I will redouble my efforts, and work harder than ever to deliver results!"
84,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_044","And on that note, I'd best get to work summarizing my findings for inclusion in my thesis."
85,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_045","If I am able to identify an explicit correlation amongst the post-Calamity change in aether concentration, the explosion of the fish population, and the increase in shipwrecks, it will go a long way toward proving my theory correct!"
86,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_000_046","Of course, I'll be needing more fish specimens before that can happen. Fair warning─I might have to send you to even more hazardous locales. And yet I'm sure you're up to the challenge, yes?"
87,"TEXT_AKTKLA503_04162_TLAQATIA_100_046","Splendid! I swear, this is the most invigorated I've ever felt about my research! Now, where to start...?"
