106,"TEXT_AKTKLA105_04136_RURUSHA_000_066","Just think back to the state we found it in, and yet it's now capable of flight for goodness' sake! We've made incredible progress."
107,"TEXT_AKTKLA105_04136_RURUSHA_000_067","That said, the rattling noise just now does have me worried. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere when inserting the new parts. We'll need to dismantle it once more and see if we can't deduce what went wrong."
