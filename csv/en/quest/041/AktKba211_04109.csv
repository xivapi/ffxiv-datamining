1,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_01","Raubahn and Arenvald relay to you worrying accounts from throughout Gyr Abania of several people transforming into beasts. Since the recent incident in Ala Gannha, rumors have been spreading that suggest those with familial ties to the Crania Lupi are the ones most likely to turn, which has only served to isolate them further and exacerbate their plight. As the former commander of the imperial unit that she herself annihilated, Fordola has volunteered to investigate the matter, with you assigned to accompany her to Ala Gannha."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_02","Raganfrid explains that the relatives of one of the Crania Lupi have disappeared under suspicious circumstances, with evidence suggesting the presence of beasts. You and Fordola decide to split up and scout the surrounding area for clues as to the missing family's whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_03","You are confronted by a ferocious beast, though it reckoned without your considerable might and is swiftly defeated. Once the dust has settled, you discover a letter that the creature appears to have been carrying."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_04","The letter contains a short message from a member of the Crania Lupi to their mother, who almost certainly transformed into the beast that you vanquished but moments ago. You stow the letter away as evidence and continue your search."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_05","Once more, you are assailed by a beast, and as before, you are victorious. As the creature dissolves into nothingness, you notice what seems to be a ring, perhaps dropped during the struggle."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_06","Upon closer inspection, the ring appears to be a wedding band, complete with an engraving. With this personal effect of the recently deceased in hand, you make your way back to Ala Gannha."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_07","During her search, Fordola also slew a blasphemy, which bore a ring that matches the one you discovered, all but confirming the fates of the three missing family members. Raganfrid's lamentations are interrupted by a man named Evrat, the brother of one of the Crania Lupi who has benefited from the efforts of the Silver Griffins. His expression soon darkens when he notices Fordola, the person responsible for his bereavement, and he is quickly overwhelmed by a malevolent aura, one with which you are all too familiar. In mere moments, his transformation into a beast is complete, and he moves to strike a young girl standing nearby. Fordola arrives in the nick of time, taking a blow to the shoulder before cutting him down. When she attempts to check on the creature's intended target, the girl's mother demands that she keep away from her child. Fordola turns to leave, but as her injury has yet to be treated, Raganfrid bids you go after her."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_08","Catching up with Fordola, you find her clutching her wounded shoulder. Although she initially refuses your aid, you insist on putting your healing abilities to use."
9,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_09","After treating Fordola's injury, she begins to speak openly about her personal struggles. Her feelings of regret and remorse come boiling to the surface, manifesting as a dark mist. For a moment, you fear she may transform into a beast in the same way as Evrat, but a few well-chosen words soon help her to regain control. She then asks that you wait with her while she recovers from her ordeal, during which time the normally taciturn soldier discusses her past."
10,"TEXT_AKTKBA211_04109_SEQ_10","Returning to the Ala Mhigan Quarter, you report to Raubahn, who offers his thanks for your part in the investigation and for minimizing casualties. He goes on to explain that in order to escape the animosity they faced in Gyr Abania, several surviving relatives of the Skulls have relocated to Ul'dah. Fearing for their safety, Raubahn plans to discuss the matter with Nanamo, and he invites you to join him.

※The next role quest will be available from the blasphemy hunter upon reaching level 87 in any healer class."
