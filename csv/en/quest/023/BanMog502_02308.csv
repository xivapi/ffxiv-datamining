Mogek looks up and nods at you approvingly."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SEQ_01","Mogek tells you that with the growing number of enterprises the Mogmenders are taking on, the demand for more crystals for crafting is growing along with it. A moogle from Moghome offered his assistance in gathering the extra crystals, and while Mogek is grateful to accept any help he can get, he mentions that the moogle has no experience whatsoever. He asks you as an expert to meet with a mirthful moogle atop Sohm Al, who is waiting patiently.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SEQ_02","You speak with the moogle at Sohm Al who confirms that he knows little about what crystals look like, let alone where he should gather them. Help him by finding a source and a sample crystal that the young one can take with him when he goes harvesting."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SEQ_03","After rooting through a selection of kupa trees, you finally find one with crystals ripe for the picking. Bring the sample kupa tree crystal back to the moogle at Sohm Al."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SEQ_04","You hand over the crafting crystal to the moogle and apprise him of the location of the tree where you found it. He thanks you for your help and prepares for his journey to the Landlord Colony. Return to Mogek and report that the young moogle is well on his way to harvest."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SEQ_05","Mogek appreciates your help in teaching the young one how to find quality crystals for the Mogmenders' construction efforts. After some thought, he mentions how strange it is that dragons were the first to teach man how to gather crystals, and now it is man who is teaching the moogles."

You see, the more enterprises the Mogmenders take on, the more crystals we must stockpile for crafting. We accepted help from an eager moogle of Moghome who will gather crystals so we can maintain our pace."
49,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_MOGEK_000_001","While we are grateful for an extra set of paws, this young one has no experience, kupo. Likely he cannot even tell a crystal from a glass shard. I would like you to assist him in finding a sample crystal. He is expecting you at the summit of Sohm Al."
50,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_010","Mogek told me to wait here for a crystal expert, so I suppose that would be you. Pleasure to make your acquaintance, kupo!"
51,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_011","I'm afraid to say I don't know very much about what kind of crystals the Mogmenders want. I was told kupa trees like the ones at the Landlord Colony are a viable source, but I wouldn't even know which ones are ripe for harvest."
52,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_012","Mogek and I agreed this would go much swifter if a master such as yourself informed me of the precise location of the trees that have crystals ripe for harvest. Then I'll handle the rest, kupo!"
53,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_013","Don't worry, I'll stay riiight here, kupo!"
54,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SYSTEM_000_020","You have found a crystal of fine quality for synthesis!"
55,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SYSTEM_000_021","You have found a crystal, but it is of unsuitable quality for synthesis."
56,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_030","Did you have any luck, kupo?"
57,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_031","So <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> is what one looks like. Wherever did you find it?"
58,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_032","Well then, I'm off to gather my first crystals. You have my thanks, kupo!"
59,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_GATHERINGMOOGLE02305_000_033","If all goes well, this could be the start of a new life for me. Maybe I could get my own set of mining tools, kupo!"
60,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_MOGEK_000_040","I suppose you were able to teach him what a well-chosen crystal looks like. Good, good."
61,"TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_MOGEK_000_041","It's strange, isn't it? That it was the dragons who first taught man how to gather the crystals from the kupa trees, and now in turn, the moogles are learning from man, kupo!"
