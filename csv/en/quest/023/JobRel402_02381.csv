0,"TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_00","Angelet looks at you expectantly."
1,"TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_01","You speak with Angelet, who makes a seemingly innocent request─with her magicked cloth in hand, she asks you to relive the fiercest battles of your past. The only condition, however, is that you do so at the scene of battle, as that is the only way to quicken the magicks of her fabric. Though the locales she insists upon are likely still teeming with danger, you are not one to balk at a challenge. And so you make haste to the sites of your past adventures.

※The key item can be obtained by clearing a dungeon via Duty Roulette: High-level Dungeons."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_02","Your stroll down memory lane was fraught with peril, but both you and Angelet's magicked cloth remain none the worse for wear, and surprisingly no different. Which seems peculiar since, according to Angelet, there should be some discernible difference in the cloth. Perhaps she can explain what, if any, change has taken place."
3,"TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_03","Angelet is beaming with excitement upon your return, and the reason for her elation gives you pause. As she explains it, her profession is the crafting of dolls using cursed materials. What was once an ostensibly normal bolt of fabric is now replete with the pain and suffering of your fallen enemies. As promised, she bequeaths to you the singing cluster you desire. In the event you cross paths with her again, you remind yourself not to ask after her merchandise.

51,"TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_ANGELET_000_004","But you can't do it in just any old place or it won't work. You'll have to take my fabric to where the fighting happened, so the memories are fresh in your mind. Now be careful, and try not to get it dirty."

61,"TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_ANGELET_000_043","Would you look at this. The texture is smooth with agony, the colors rich with hopelessness. It practically drips with the resentment of all the people you've slain."
