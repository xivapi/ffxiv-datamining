50,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_010","There you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Do not look so tense, my friend. For once this does not concern our difficulties repairing the plaza."
51,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_011","On the contrary, I simply wish to offer you my sincerest gratitude for your help thus far. You have given this old man a meaningful way to spend his days, and thanks to the efforts of all and sundry, I have recaptured a piece of my family's history."
52,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_013","Yes, <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> family. For although House Dzemael is now renowned for its skill at stonemasonry, that was not always the case. No, as recently as three centuries ago, we were but humble crafters."
53,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_014","It was not until a lord of House Dzemael married the daughter of a minor lord─whose house was known for its deep knowledge of architecture─that the first brick of our renown was laid. That maiden's family name was Faurechort."
54,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_015","A name which rings familiar, yes? One of the three original architects of Bahrr Lehs: Marinche de Faurechort. His blood courses through the veins of every son and daughter of House Dzemael, and his teachings have enriched our lives."

57,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_018","I never did feel entirely comfortable among the stiff nobility of Ishgard, and I doubt I shall be sorely missed. Certainly many will bid good riddance to me, but it does not matter. The feeling shall be mutual!"
58,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_OHLDEEH_000_020","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, greetings! Quite the impressive work, wouldn't you agree?"
59,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_OHLDEEH_000_021","When Mogzin first told me about Bahrr Lehs, I was sure nothing would ever get done. I certainly never dreamed he would go so far as to receive Gullinbursti's praise!"

61,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_OHLDEEH_000_023","As for me, I have no pressing engagements for the next hundred years, after which I will go into hibernation.

62,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_OHLDEEH_000_024","After all of our hard work, I've come to understand why Gullinbursti felt so attached to this place. Perhaps in a thousand years, I'll look upon Bahrr Lehs with a similar fondness."

65,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_MOGZIN_000_032","No doubt we'll face difficulties that'll make repairing this plaza look as simple as painting a pebble. But the experience we've gained here will see us through!"
