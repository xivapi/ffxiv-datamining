The seething stonemason is shouting obscenities into the wind."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_01","On the outskirts of Moghome, you cross paths with a visibly agitated stonemason. He is grateful to speak with someone who stands on two legs, and explains he was dispatched to Moghome by the Temple Knights to teach its denizens stonemasonry, only to be sent on a journey of tedious chores and pointless errands upon his arrival. Eager to return home and never see another pom-pom again, the stonemason asks you to inform Mogkul of his immediate resignation.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_02","Mogkul is disappointed but not surprised in the least by your news. He confesses that this is the ninth time an Ishgardian craftsman has been driven from the Churning Mists by the moogles' antics. Fearing that Ser Handeloup may come to regret the arrangement between Moghome and Ishgard, Mogkul asks you to accompany him to the Congregation so he might offer his sincerest apologies in person."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_03","Mogkul apologizes to Ser Handeloup for the actions of his kin, but while the commander is willing to forgive and forget, he explains that Ishgard can spare no more stonemasons. As if on cue, an elderly male addressed only as Lord Tarresson enters the Congregation. Apparently, the nine stonemasons sent to Moghome were his own pupils, and for the honor of his house and his profession he says he will bear the burden of helping the moogles. He worries that his aged body and mind cannot attempt the task alone, however, and persuades you to lend him your aid. Heartened by your agreement, Tarresson immediately instructs Mogkul to gather the moogles involved in Zenith's repair. After Mogkul departs, Tarresson claims he plans to show the moogles some trickery of his own, and bids you follow him to the Jeweled Crozier."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_04","You find Tarresson in the bustling marketplace, a mischievous look on his face. He questions you about the eating habits of the moogles, and once you mention kupo nuts you can see the gears turning in his head. He asks you to make a fake kupo nut, as you are the most familiar with their shape. Use the materials he has given you to make the most appetizing kupo nut you can muster. 

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mathye."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_05","Tarresson is impressed by your final product, and understands now why moogles have such affection for the nuts. He will remain behind in Ishgard to make more, based on your example, and bids you go to Bahrr Lehs near Zenith and await his arrival."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_06","Bahrr Lehs is little more than dust and rubble, and you arrive to see Tarresson and Mogkul looking over the dismal scene. The Mogmenders are nowhere in sight. Unperturbed by this setback, Tarresson asks Mogkul who among them is most prone to trickery. The moogle reveals that one Mogzin, leader of the Mogmenders, is often the butt of his brethren's jokes. Tarresson, eager to proceed, assures Mogkul that the Mogmenders will be hard at work before long. It seems that Tarresson's plan is soon to come to fruition, and he asks for your assistance in locating Mogzin, who should be somewhere in the nearby palace ruins."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_07","After a thorough search, you and Tarresson come upon a moogle, who is muttering aloud. Surprised by your sudden appearance, the moogle hastily explains that a rare sickness that occurs once in a millennium has washed over Moghome, causing all the moogles' wings to feel as heavy as stones. Tarresson makes a show of sympathy, lamenting the fact that he cannot share his bounty of kupo nuts with the moogles. Mogzin perks up at the mention of the delicacy, and quickly changes his story. It would seem that Mogzin mistook napping moogles for sick ones. Satisfied by this attempt to explain away his lie, Mogzin departs to gather the rest of the Mogmenders, and states they will meet you at Bahrr Lehs."
8,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_08","The Mogmenders await their promised feast in the ruins of Bahrr Lehs, and Tarresson gladly obliges them. He presents them three plump kupo nuts on a silver platter, and the moogles can barely contain themselves at the sight. Mogzin bites into the nearest one, only to find out that it is a fake. Though disappointed, the moogles are quite impressed by Tarresson's deception, some going so far as to say it may be the most elaborate trick in recent memory. With his plan finally at an end, Tarresson makes the moogles an offer. If they pledge to be hardworking students, he will teach them to craft whatever they can imagine. Mogzin agrees to this arrangement with much aplomb, and Tarresson gives the Mogmenders their first project: the restoration of Bahrr Lehs."
9,"TEXT_BANMOG001_02320_SEQ_09","With an amicable agreement having been reached, Mogzin formally introduces himself as the leader of the Mogmenders, and reaffirms his resolve to be a diligent pupil and fulfill the moogles' obligation to restore Zenith. He asks if you intend to remain and assist with the rebuilding and the Mogmenders' education, and flits with joy when you say yes. Full of vim and vigor, the moogles set to work. How long their work ethic lasts, however, remains to be seen."
