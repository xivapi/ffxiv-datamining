1,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_01","Commander Bloeidin confirms Urianger's report that the kobolds of U'Ghamaro have grown more aggressive of late. Of more immediate concern, however, is the fact that one of the beastmen may be skulking about the camp, possibly with designs on the crystal store. Perhaps with the aid of Alphinaud and Alisaie, you can sniff out this mysterious infiltrator."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_02","Though Alphinaud readily acknowledges that the kobolds' recent behavior does suggest that a summoning is imminent, he finds it odd that a single kobold would wander so close to a Maelstrom camp and risk drawing attention to the efforts of his brethren. Nevertheless, the beastman's presence presents a valuable opportunity to learn more of the kobolds' plans─providing he can be taken alive, of course."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_03","The curiously small kobold proves quite easy to find, but difficult to catch, darting away after sensing your approach. However, in his panicked, disoriented state, he surely cannot have gone far."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_04","Sure enough, you come upon the young kobold hiding beneath the wooden stairs to the east of the camp. This time, he begins to make a half-hearted appeal for you to keep your distance, but overcome by fear, stops short and flees once more."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_05","You catch up with the kobold yet again, who─yet again─manages only a handful of words before running away. With a sigh, you resume your pursuit, offering a silent prayer that his little legs will grow weary before your own."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_06","Blessedly, the kobold does not attempt to escape a fourth time, having mustered the courage to stand his ground and plead his case. Joined by Alphinaud, Alisaie, and Commander Bloeidin, you listen as he introduces himself as Ga Bu of the 620th Order. The young child then reveals his reason for coming to Camp Overlook: to beseech the Maelstrom to stop the patriarch from summoning Great Father Titan. Ga Bu goes on to explain that his parents, along with other like-minded kobolds, spoke out against the patriarch's plans, only to be taken away to serve as “coke for the furnace.” This ominous turn of phrase prompts Alisaie to recall tales of beastmen fashioning ritual foci from the bones of their brethren as a means to summon more powerful incarnations of their gods. Fearing the worst, Alphinaud instructs the commander to inform Maelstrom Command that Titan's return may be imminent, and declares that the Scions will attempt to infiltrate the kobold stronghold, secure the crystals, and free the prisoners."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_07","Lowering his voice, Alphinaud confesses that although he is confident the primal has yet to be summoned, it may yet be too late to save Ga Bu's parents and the other prisoners. Regardless, you must do all you can to stop the patriarch's plans, and for that you will need to enlist the help of the brave young kobold before you."

51,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_BLOEIDIN_000_011","Matter of fact, our scouts spotted one sniffin' about the stores just now, likely lookin' to make off with an armful of crystals."

55,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_ALPHINAUD_000_030","Our Maelstrom friends seem notably more agitated than when first we arrived. Do you happen to know why that might be?"
56,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_ALPHINAUD_000_031","A kobold in the camp, you say...?"
57,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_ALPHINAUD_000_032","That would appear to corroborate Urianger's information, yes. But to be so reckless as to infiltrate a Maelstrom camp and draw attention to their efforts is passing strange."
58,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_ALPHINAUD_000_033","Well, there will be time to think on this later. For the present, we must do everything in our power to prevent Titan's summoning─and that means finding and questioning this kobold."
59,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_ALPHINAUD_000_040","Surely all this commotion cannot have escaped the kobold's notice. If he has any sense, he will attempt to quit this place, will he not?"
60,"TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_ALISAIE_000_045","One of the scouts said he looked quite small for a kobold. Could he be hiding somewhere like this?"
