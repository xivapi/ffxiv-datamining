1,"TEXT_HEAVNF101_02351_SEQ_01","Tataru asks that you meet her at the Diamond Forge within Rowena's House of Splendors. Though she neglects to explain the nature of her business there, she assures you it will not take long..."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNF101_02351_SEQ_02","After being ambushed by the Diamond Forge artisans and their measuring tapes, you are called to attend a meeting with your fellow Scions at the Rising Stones.

Hearing this, Y'shtola bids you bear word of the looming threat to Ishgard while she and the others notify the rest of the Alliance leaders. You resolve to bring the matter before Lucia at the Temple Knights' headquarters."
