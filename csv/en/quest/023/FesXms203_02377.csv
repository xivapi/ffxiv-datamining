※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_01","You approach the raven-haired registrar, who is on the verge of quite literally tearing out his flowing locks as he laments his utter inability to lift young Reauverre's spirits. He quickly gathers himself and proposes that the two of you ask around to see what might be behind the boy's recent malaise. Mayhap the other children in the ward might be able to offer some insight.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_02","Along with less practical information, you manage to glean from the children that Reauverre has been sighted concealing an object beneath his bed. You resolve to investigate, in hopes that whatever lies hidden might shine a light upon the boy's recent change in behavior."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_03","Your search of the space beneath Reauverre's bed reveals an envelope containing a missive for the child. Loath to breach the boy's privacy without proper permission, you resolve to take it to the raven-haired registrar."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_04","With some pause, the raven-haired registrar decides to open the letter, deeming the boy's safe recovery to take priority over the observation of proper privacy protocol. Within the envelope is a missive from Reauverre's father─an apology for breaking a promise to visit his boy for Starlight. The registrar deduces that this is the cause for the boy's low spirits, and determines that the best course of action is to seek out the father and inform him of Reauverre's plight. He departs for the Hustings Strip to rendezvous with a friend who might have some information as to the father's whereabouts, and entreats you to join him there."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_05","You arrive at the Hustings Strip to see the raven-haired registrar immersed in conversation with a bearded Lalafell. He explains that the man is an old acquaintance of his mother's who was able to use his vast web of informants to ascertain the whereabouts of Reauverre's father─for a likely substantial fee. As the physician tells it, the boy's father is currently in Limsa Lominsa awaiting a vessel to carry him east to Radz–at–Han. He bids you hurry there with news of Reauverre's state in hopes of catching the father before he sets sail."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_06","You find Reauverre's father on the ferry docks in Limsa Lominsa. The man is deeply pained to hear of his son's despondent state, but explains that he simply cannot return to Ul'dah at this time. As he tells it, he is on the verge of procuring a sizable stock of the rare herb needed to treat his boy's illness─an opportunity that may never present itself again. He proffers a gift intended for Reauverre, and bids you take it to the boy in his stead. You resolve to return to the children's ward and do precisely that─after checking in with the registrar, of course."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_07","Upon hearing your story and seeing the gift entrusted to you by Reauverre's father, the registrar is hopeful that this act should suffice to return a smile to the boy's face, and the will to stave off illness back to his heart. Observing the bond of friendship you have forged with the boy, he bids you be the one to make the special delivery."
8,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_08","Reauverre initially balks at the gift, but relents when you and the registrar explain the true reason behind his father's breaking of his Starlight promise. Finally coming to understand that both his father and those around him have only his health and happiness at heart, the boy breaks into a beaming smile and resolves to triumph over his sickness, that the day he may live with his father once more may not be far off. The registrar breathes a sigh of relief, and bids you come to the admitting desk, where he would have a final word with you in private."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_09","A surprise visit from Guildmaster Severian of the Alchemists' Guild leads the registrar to reveal to you his true identity. He is none other than Damielliot─a one-time patient of the children's ward who now serves as its director, a position he inherited from his parents, who lost their lives in the Calamity. He reflects upon his own reasons for choosing the path of a physician, and thanks you for the kindness you have shown to those who need it most this Starlight season. In the end, he encourages you to return to the children's ward before Starlight is over, that your presence might bring good cheer to his charges once more."
