Master Mogzin is tugging at his pom in frustration."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_01","The Mogmenders are dealing with the latest in what has been a long string of difficulties. It is time once again to put your collective knowledge to work and find a solution to their current problem.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_02","A shipment of supplies from the Temple Knights is long overdue for arrival, and Mogzin suspects that the moogles in charge of delivery may have hidden them. He takes it upon himself to find the moogles responsible and give them a harsh talking to, and sets off towards Asah. Worried that the crates will be too heavy for the moogle to carry back alone, Tarresson asks you to follow him and assist in the recovery."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_03","You catch up with Mogzin in Asah, and next to him you find a remorseful-looking moogle. Evidently, this is the moogle who hid the supplies, and after a stern lecture from Mogzin he has agreed to reveal their location. Mogzin is determined to handle this matter on his own, although he does give you one crate to deliver to Bahrr Lehs before departing to look for the rest of them."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_04","Tarresson confides in you that the supplies are meant to increase the speed of the Mogmenders' work. After observing that their current tools were unfit for a moogle's small paws, he surmised that wind-aspected tools might be more suitable for the flying folk. Before he produces tools for all the Mogmenders, however, he requires a sample to base the rest on. He enlists your aid in producing a special moogle hammer, and instructs you to bring the crate to Mogmul before beginning your work."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_05","Mogmul gladly accepts the supplies, although you can hear disappointment in his voice at the lack of kupo nuts. However, the hungry moogle remains diligent, and is ready to replenish your materials at any time.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mogmul Mogbelly."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_06","As Tarresson applies the final touches to the hammer, Mogzin returns to Bahrr Lehs, bearing news that he has found the rest of the supplies. Tarresson then informs Mogzin of the gift you both made, and although the moogle is wary at first, he eventually accepts. With hammer in hand, Mogzin remarks that the difference between this tool and the old ones is like night and day. It would seem Tarresson's intuition was correct, and with these tools the Mogmenders can forge further ahead on the path to mastery."

50,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_002","I've heard you have plenty of experience with matters of this sort. Perhaps you can lend us your expertise in searching for lost things, kupo!"
51,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_010","Just when I had forgotten how entertaining the moogles' antics could be, this happens. You see, we are expecting a shipment of supplies from the Temple Knights, but their delivery is long overdue. Mogzin here suspects foul play."
52,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_011","That's right, kupo! With the Mogmenders busy at Bahrr Lehs, I asked the moogles at Asah to help transport the supplies. Unfortunately, I fear they may have hid them, or worse. Our only choice is to find the moogles in charge and question them ourselves!"
53,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_012","Give them a good talking to, Mogzin! As the leader of the Mogmenders, you must make it clear that you will not tolerate such trickery! I have faith the supplies will be here at Bahrr Lehs before long."
54,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_013","Of course, Tarresson! I'll give them a scolding they won't soon forget! Perhaps I'll even make them carry the supplies themselves!"
55,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_014","Ah, look at him. Off to rebuke an irresponsible moogle, as a father would a disobedient child. However, as we are expecting a good many crates, another pair of young strapping legs to carry them certainly would not hurt. Go and assist him should he require it."
56,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_015","Mogzin will certainly be grateful for your company when he sees the size of the crates. Besides, it would bring me comfort to know you were by his side."
57,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TRANSPORTER_000_016","You must be that adventurer who's helping the Mogmenders! I'm terribly sorry for hiding the supplies, kupo. I couldn't help myself. It's like there's some other moogle living inside my pom, and he made me hide them up there, and over there, and down there..."
58,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_020","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, what're you doing here? Did Tarresson send you to accompany me again?"

60,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_022","Alas, I'd rather not spend my time reprimanding others. There's still so much to be done at Bahrr Lehs. But lately, I've felt that no matter how many hours we labor for, we never get any closer to completion..."

With any luck, we'll see each other again shortly!"

65,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_031","Aye, these are certainly the supplies we ordered. How kind of Mogzin to shoulder the burden of finding the rest. While he is occupied, there is a matter I would like to discuss with you."
66,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_032","As you have doubtless noticed, Mogzin has become an admirable crafter in his own right. In fact, the zeal with which each and every Mogmender approaches their work has been naught short of astonishing. However, despite their best efforts, their progress leaves something to be desired."
67,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_033","Curious as to why, I observed the Mogmenders at work, and one thing that struck me was the feebleness of their blows. Now, this is no fault of the moogles. It is not due to laziness that they strike so lightly. No, I believe the tools are to blame."
68,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_034","The moogles cannot grip their tools firmly, and they do not have our thewy arms. Tools made for us are entirely unsuitable for them. But what if we were to furnish them with tools attuned to their aetheric energy?"
69,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_036","Which brings us to the supplies. With them we shall make wind-aspected tools, which I believe the Mogmenders will be able to swing as mightily as we swing our own tools! I would give you the honor of helping me craft the first one!"
70,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_040","I only ask that you craft a hammer head. I have procured a material known as aurum regis, possessed of superior aetherial conductivity. Use it to make a well-balanced head so the tool is not clumsy in our furry friends' paws."
71,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_050","I ask that you craft a simple, but essential part: a hammer's handle. Ensure that its shape is suited to a moogle's paws. Afterwards, I shall apply a specially made varnish which will enhance the aetherial conductivity of the tool."

75,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGMUL_000_070","The others think I have the easiest job in the Mogmenders, but they're wrong! Have you ever flapped your wings in place for hours on end? No? Then you have no idea how hungry it makes you, kupo! But I must do my duty. What supplies do you require this time?"
76,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGMUL_000_071","Ah, so these are the errant supplies? Any kupo nuts? I thought not. In that case, feel free to take anything you need!"

78,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGMUL_100_072","Well, you've certainly outdone yourself this time, kupo! If only I had a kupo nut half so splendid as the work you create."
79,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_080","Are you finished already? Of course, I expect only the most superb craftsmanship from you."
80,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_081","Ah, yes. This is a masterpiece, of that there can be no doubt! Now, we only need take what I have made and..."
81,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_082","Look, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, have you ever seen a hammer so mighty, so majestic, so...miniature!?

85,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_086","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you too? Hmmm, perhaps you are telling the truth after all. Very well, show me your present. Just in case, I shall gird my pom for the worst!"
86,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_087","This hammer, it's...different from the others."
87,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_088","Both <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and I poured our hearts and souls into it, so I hope you are able to make good use of it.

88,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_MOGZIN_000_089","It's so light, and fits in my paws perfectly. Were those other tools just for practice? Why, I feel as if I could chip away at stone all day and night, kupo!"
