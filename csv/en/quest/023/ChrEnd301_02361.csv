1,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_SEQ_01","Ulaa's safe return has brought with it the revival of a certain vicious rumor. Once more, the seminarians whisper amongst themselves, accusing Archombadin of arranging the girl's kidnapping, and this time they are resolved to take justice into their own hands. When the headmistress calls for an emergency meeting, the student body takes full advantage of the lack of supervision and moves to call for Archombadin's removal from the scholasticate. Asking that you look into matters on his behalf, Briardien leaves you with Blaisie to pursue his own line of investigation."
2,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_SEQ_02","The tension is palpable as the seminarians call for Archombadin's immediate expulsion. One youth is particularly vocal about seeing the prefect removed, and his frenzied shouts are quick to incite the other students gathered around. Her own efforts to do so having already failed, Blaisie asks you to attempt to ease the mounting tension. Perhaps you should start by trying to /soothe the stern seminarian."
3,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_SEQ_03","While your soothing words have helped to calm the enraged seminarian, the possibility of not taking immediate action seems to have triggered a deep-seated fear of retribution from Archombadin in another. Help to /rally the terrified boy's spirits before the feeling begins to spread to the rest of the seminarians."
4,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_SEQ_04","Upon hearing your words of encouragement, the young seminarian's fear dissipates and the floor finally opens for a calm discussion on how to proceed. Speak with Theomocent that the talk might commence."
5,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_SEQ_05","The merciful moment of measured discussion and decorum is sadly short-lived, as Theomocent declines to lead the proposed charge on Archombadin. Accusations and insults fly, and a furious student body marches out of the room, intent on starting up a petition that will see the dormitory prefect expelled. A flabbergasted Theomocent, Leigh, Crammevoix, and Blaisie are left in their wake. Is there nothing that can be done to prevent further discord from taking root at the scholasticate?"

The Temple Knights have deemed Ulaa fit to recount the events of her kidnapping, and have taken her into the room just beyond for questioning, with Blaisie to accompany for support."

52,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_KNIGHT02361_000_004","As she tells it, the only people she saw during her captivity were the two thugs now in our custody. We've questioned them thrice over, but they insist their employer had disguised themselves so well they cannot even say for certain if they are a man or a woman, much less give us a description."
53,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_KNIGHT02361_000_005","For what little it's worth, we did learn that the two were once orphans, raised as charges of the See. To betray the nation that fed and clothed them for a handful of coin... <sigh> But I must return to my post. Should we come across anything of actual significance, I shall be sure to alert you."

55,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_BLAISIE_000_007","I fear that Ulaa's testimony proved entirely unenlightening. There is another development, however, that has been troubling me. Rumors that Archombadin was behind the abduction are circulating around the scholasticate once more."

57,"TEXT_CHREND301_02361_BLAISIE_000_009","And this time, the students seem convinced more than ever of his guilt. No longer content to sit back and wait for events to take their course, they've been pushing for his expulsion."
