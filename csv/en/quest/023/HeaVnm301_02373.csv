1,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_SEQ_01","Stacia hails you on Coldwind, and explains that Cait Sith has made some significant discoveries in the recovered Mhachi tome. It seems the feline familiar is eager for you to return to the Parrock so that he can share his revelations with you and the Redbill crew. Fly over to the sky pirates' hideaway, and speak with Cait Sith inside Leofard's chambers."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_SEQ_02","Cait Sith once more holds court atop Leofard's table, and reveals the history behind his master, High Voidmage Cessair, and the summoning of Diabolos. As if in response to the mention of his name, the bat-winged voidsent descends upon the Parrock, and, after a decidedly one-sided battle, seizes the Nullstone scepter from Cait Sith's paws. Diabolos then threatens to tear the Parrock from the sky, only to withdraw when Radlia and a fleet of Talons arrive to reinforce the Redbills. Speak with the injured Leofard, and discuss what is to be done in the aftermath of the fiend's attack.

※The Parrock can be reached from the Redbill standard on Coldwind."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_SEQ_03","With the secrets of the Nullstone's power now revealed to him, Cait Sith is desperate to recover the relic from Diabolos's clutches and carry out the will of his long-dead master. The familiar is convinced that the island where Radlia uncovered the Mhachi tome is the logical location of the fiend's stronghold, and counsels a swift and sudden assault. Reasoning that Leofard's injuries will only endanger the mission, however, Cait Sith instead recruits Radlia and her crew to escort you to the floating haven. Gather your party of battle-hardened adventurers, and ride the winds into the voidsent's lair!

※Dun Scaith can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_SEQ_04","You have recovered the Nullstone and defeated the nightmarish Diabolos. Make your way back to the Parrock."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_SEQ_05","Despite besting Diabolos in combat, the wily voidsent is not so easily banished. Even as the fiend stands poised to flee with the Nullstone in hand, however, Leofard's unexpected and forceful arrival turns the tables in your favor. You retrieve the artifact for Cait Sith, and the Mhachi familiar unleashes its power upon Diabolos. With your demonic foe annihilated, it is time to return to the Parrock and discuss events with the Redbills' irrepressible captain.

※The Parrock can be reached from the Redbill standard on Coldwind."

56,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_CAITSITH_000_100","As I suspected, this tome was penned by a Mhachi sorcerer of superior standing. As well as detailing the methods by which the full power of the Nullstone might be unleashed, its pages also contain a number of revelations concerning my master, High Voidmage Cessair."

65,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_CAITSITH_000_109","The only saving grace in all this madness was when that damnable fiend was sealed away by the white mages of Amdapor. I shudder to think what would have happened had he been reunited with his queen."
66,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_LEOFARD_000_110","So now, fifteen hundred years later, Diabolos is lookin' to finish what he started? I thought the bat-faced bastard was just some opportunistic underling, but it turns out he's the main villain behind this whole mess..."

96,"TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_CAITSITH_000_311","As the Void Ark never arrived at its destination, however, the island remained uninhabited. I can imagine no more suitable hideaway for our scheming fiend."
