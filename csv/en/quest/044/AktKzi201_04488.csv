Verpaulaine has something to ask of you once more."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZI201_04488_SEQ_01","Verpaulaine informs you that he has recently made friends with a young troll, who you soon identify as Shaggles. He mentions that he is struggling to communicate with the creature, so you join him to go and see your mutual acquaintance.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZI201_04488_SEQ_02","Shaggles explains to you that he has come up with a spell that would enable him to converse properly, but he is unable to activate it on his own. Verpaulaine then says he could try using the elemental reactor to create an artificial current of wind-aspected aether, which could give Shaggles the helping hand he needs. The troll agrees to give the boy's plan a try, so the three of you head to the reactor."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZI201_04488_SEQ_03","Having created an artificial current some distance from the reactor, Verpaulaine bids you accompany him and the troll once more, so as to keep them safe from the threats that would sup on its aether."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZI201_04488_SEQ_04","Leading the pair, you prepare to wend through Labyrinthos's weeds so that Shaggles can do...whatever it is that Shaggles plans to do.

※You must be accompanied by Shaggles and Verpaulaine to complete this task. Speak with either of them again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZI201_04488_SEQ_05","The plan is a roaring success and Shaggles is at last able to communicate freely. Before he is able to fully enjoy his new voice, however, Mussalfret and N'welhi Tia appear claiming they have something to impart to the pair. You are all bid to join Verpaulaine's father in Sharlayan Hamlet."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZI201_04488_SEQ_06","A representative from the Studium says that in light of their recent accomplishments, the scholarch has decided to invite Verpaulaine and Shaggles to enroll at the Studium. Verpaulaine is unsure at first, given his lack of experience of the outside world, but you and Shaggles succeed in convincing him to take the chance of a lifetime."
