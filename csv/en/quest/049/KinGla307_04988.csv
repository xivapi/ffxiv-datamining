※Should you run out of ingredients while attempting to concoct the Boonewa soda, more can be found in Xeerol Ja's spice box."

Befitting her position of proprietress, Xeerol Ja welcomes her guests and bid them imbibe the offerings of Xeerol Ja Juicecraft to their hearts' content. You watch the diverse peoples of Tuliyollal wander the tables in search of tasty and healthful drinks, and Xeerol Ja suggests a personal toast─to you and Halnaruk, her faithful companions. Leading you to three glasses of Boonewa soda, Xeerol Ja explains that she conceived this drink in your honor, and hopes it might refresh you during your journeys to come. The heartfelt thanks proves too much for Halnaruk, who insists on professionalism, even as he hops up and down in embarrassment. The mild aftertaste of syrup and spice lingers in your mouth, long after the event has drawn to a close..."

Having reaffirmed their bond as friends and business partners, Xeerol Ja and Halnaruk will continue tending to the good health, happiness, and hydration of Tuliyollal's diverse peoples. After all, as Halnaruk so succinctly put it: juicymix is bestlife."
