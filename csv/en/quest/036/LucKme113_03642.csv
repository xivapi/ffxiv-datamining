50,"TEXT_LUCKME113_03642_CHAINUZZ_000_010","Gah, there's no point worrying about such things now. I'll get back to my calculations. You, meanwhile, should go and rest as your friends suggested."

75,"TEXT_LUCKME113_03642_ROBEMAN_000_911","(-Zenos-)It is because they are no longer in the Source."

77,"TEXT_LUCKME113_03642_ROBEMAN_000_913","(-Zenos-)This presents an opportunity. If we can defeat the Alliance prior to the Scions' return, we may eliminate their order at a stroke."
78,"TEXT_LUCKME113_03642_ROBEMAN_000_914","(-Zenos-)And with the Scions gone, none shall remain to thwart our plans. It will be but a matter of striking down the hero upon <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> homecoming."
