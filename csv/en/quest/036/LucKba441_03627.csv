1,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_SEQ_01","Cerigg is pleased to inform you that Taynor's training has been progressing well in your absence. There is one rub, however─while there is no doubting the boy's abilities, he lacks for experience on the battlefield. Cerigg proposes an excursion to Lakeland and the Forest of the Lost Shepherd, where Taynor might learn how to wield his magical abilities in battle."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_SEQ_02","You arrive in the forest, where Cerigg would have you provide a demonstration for Taynor before the boy ventures into the fray for himself. Find a suitable specimen from among the local fauna and dispatch it with your spells, so that your young protégé might follow your lead."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_SEQ_03","You pick out a particularly nasty wolverine and make short work of it as Taynor looks on. Speak with the boy and offer any further guidance you may to prepare him for his first battle."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_SEQ_04","Taynor struggles mightily in his first attempt at fighting on his own, prompting Cerigg to rush into the fray and dispatch the feral wolverine himself. The boy, clearly dismayed, retreats from the battlefield and hangs his head low. Speak to him and offer whatever encouragement you can."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_SEQ_05","Though his disappointment is palpable, Taynor is able to regain his courage thanks to advice and rousing words from you and Cerigg. He challenges a wolverine once more, and this time emerges victorious in his attempt. Duly impressed, Cerigg encourages the boy to face more foes until the tactics and techniques become second nature. The fighting done for the day, you decide to speak with Taynor and congratulate him on his success."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_SEQ_06","You speak with an elated Taynor, who clearly has gained a newfound confidence from his triumphs on the battlefield. Cerigg, too, is duly impressed, commenting that the boy has more than proved himself today. The three of you agree to return to Mord Souq, where you will plot out your next course of action."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_SEQ_07","Upon your return to Mord Souq, Taynor─who has taken to his training like a fish to water─rushes off to review all that he has learned. Cerigg observes that the boy has come far in a short time, and that it is only a matter of time before he will be ready for the ultimate confrontation with the sin eater Phronesis─a battle which will also be a confrontation with Taynor's own past. The bounty hunter and you, as well, will endeavor to train as best you can, that your entire band will be fully prepared to face your formidable quarry.

※The next role quest will be available from Cerigg upon reaching level 80 in any magical ranged DPS class."

48,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_000","I was just talking with Cerigg, when I had a thought. If Nyelbert's regrets truly live on inside Phronesis, might I not be able to reach him somehow? To convince him to leave us in peace?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_001","The words had barely left my mouth when he shot me a glare that pierced me like a dagger. “Expect reason or mercy from a sin eater, and it will be the death of you,” he said. “Though it may have the form of a man, its mind is that of a beast that lives only to feed on our flesh.”"
50,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_002","It would seem I was a bit too idealistic. Clearly, I still have much to learn about this world..."
51,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_010","That look in your eyes... Yes, I can see that you have gained much strength since last we met. You'll be pleased to hear that Taynor has managed to make steady progress in his training as well."
52,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_011","The boy believes he has regained much of the knowledge and skill he possessed before getting sucked into that pocket of time and space. An admirable feat, considering that it was not long ago that he could scarcely remember his own name."
53,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_012","And yet...there is one aspect of his training that has yet to be addressed. Put simply, the boy lacks experience in battle."
54,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_013","To work the magic necessary to seal up the hollows, I must maintain perfect focus and clarity of mind. If the battle with Phronesis is my first, I fear my concentration will be disrupted all too easily."
55,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_014","And so I thought I'd take the boy out into the wilds, that he might acclimate himself to the battlefield and further hone his command of magic in the process."
56,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_017","And yet, we must keep a wide berth of Amh Araeng. Were we to encounter Phronesis before we are fully prepared, the results could be disastrous."
57,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_018","And so I propose that we go on an excursion of sorts. Would you be willing to accompany us? I believe there is much the boy could learn from your example."
58,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_019","Excellent! Then let us make for Lakeland. The beasts in the Forest of the Lost Shepherd should provide a fair challenge for the lad."

61,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_051","How do you like my new clothes, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Not only are they stylish─why, I can just feel the power welling up from deep within me! They were a present from Cerigg. Isn't he the best!?"
62,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_052","It was a simple investment, nothing more. We must seize every possible advantage if we hope to triumph over our foe."
63,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_053","But enough idle chitchat─we have work to do. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I would ask you to begin by setting an example for the boy─showing him precisely how you conduct yourself in battle."
64,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_054","We can't very well just toss him to the wolverines all on his own, now can we?"
65,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_055","So why don't you get out there and hunt one down for us? Taynor, watch carefully and let <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> show you how it's done."
66,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_070","If he were an aspiring archer, I'd gladly show him the ropes myself, but I fear I'm out of my league when it comes to magic. Go hunt down one of those wolverines and show the boy how it's done."
67,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_075","It is an honor to learn from you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I promise I will not take my eyes off you for even a moment!"

69,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_100","That was incredible! The sheer destructive power of your spells, the way you seamlessly weaved one incantation after the next...everything! But tell me: what would you say is the most important thing a mage should keep in mind when doing battle with a fearsome foe?"
70,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
71,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_A1_000_000","Just blast your foes with everything you've got."

78,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_120","Forgive me, friend. I was beginning to fear for the boy's dignity, if not his life."

80,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_141","Don't get so down on yourself, lad. I shouldn't have jumped in the way I did. I daresay you were starting to get the hang of it there at the end."
81,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_142","I thought it would be a simple enough task to follow <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s lead, but when that savage creature stared me down, I was too flustered to put what I learned into practice."
82,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_143","...Indeed. It is not the strength of your magicks that is the issue. You simply must learn to compose yourself."

87,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_150","Thank you. I'm sure you are right. I can't allow my foe to break my concentration like this. Anyhow, let me try once more. This time will go better─I promise you!"
88,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_151","Yes, the boy will be fine... I must stay my hand..."

90,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_153","Now <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> how you wallop a wolverine! Well done, lad─I'm proud I could be here for your first victory."

92,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_155","But don't let up now, boy! You must keep battling until all that you've learned becomes second nature. Now, are you ready?"

94,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_180","<pant> <pant> That was...rather more difficult than I expected. And yet, thanks to you and Cerigg, I feel like I can hold my own on the battlefield now."
95,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_181","I'd have to agree. The way you made short work of that last critter, I'd say it's time to find you a more worthy foe. Let us return to Mord Souq and plot our next course of action."
96,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_200","I must say, that training session was most exhilarating! There's nothing quite like the feeling of vanquishing fearsome foes and gaining confidence with every thrilling victory."

98,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_221","You've taught him not only how to wield his spells in battle, but how to maintain his focus in the face of danger. With those fundamentals under his belt, it is just a matter of time and practice until he's ready to face Phronesis."
99,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_TAYNOR_000_222","I promise you, my friends...I will not let you down. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd best go and write down all I've learned today while it's fresh in my memory!"
100,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_223","Such passion and determination... This must be the boy he always was, before his time beyond the rift stole from him his memories and his spirit."
101,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_224","He devotes himself to his training that he might help us fell Phronesis, and bring his friend a measure of salvation..."
102,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_225","There is no telling what course the battle will take, but I suspect the boy will be forced to confront his past head-on. It will not be easy for him, and yet I believe it is a necessary step for him in order to forge himself a new future."
103,"TEXT_LUCKBA441_03627_CERIGG_000_226","For Taynor's sake, and for the sake of those who call Amh Araeng home, we must triumph in this battle."
