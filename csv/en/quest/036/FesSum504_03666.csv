49,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_001","Don't fret if this is your first time, for the rules of the challenge are simple enough. First, I will prescribe for you a particular dish. Next, you'll procure the necessary ingredients and get cooking. Finally, you'll bring your creation back to me for inspection. If your culinary creation is up to snuff, you'll win yourself a Faire voucher for your efforts!"
50,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_002","And now, without further ado, the dish you'll be preparing for us is...battered fish! Never saw that one coming, did you?"
51,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_003","It's a simple yet tasty treat that really is all the rage among faire-goers at this time of year. Crispy on the outside, lightly flaky on the inside...if you've never had it yourself, you really owe it to yourself to give it a try!"
52,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_004","Back again to take part in the Iron Culinarian Challenge, are we? Well, then you've come to the right place! I'll spare you the details, as I know you're an old hand at this by now."
53,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_005","If you're in need of fresh haddock, the friendly fisherman just over yonder would be happy to part with one of his catches...for the right price, of course. Now go forth, friend, and fashion a culinary creation that will win the hearts of all who partake in it!"
54,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_006","I just can't wait to feast my eyes on the battered fish you whip up for us, friend!"
55,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_010","Take a whiff of that simply scrumptious aroma! I can only assume that you have what I think you have?"
56,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_011","Why, just look at it! Freshly caught haddock, battered and fried to a deep golden brown! Why, if I hadn't already wolfed down ten pieces just today, I doubt I could keep myself from devouring it on the spot!"
57,"TEXT_FESSUM504_03666_HILDELANA_000_012","But I jest. You may rest assured that your most mouthwatering creation will find a good home in the tummy of one of your fellow festival-goers. Take this Faire voucher as your reward, and take pride in a job well done. Farewell, and should you ever be so inclined as to show off your skills with a skillet once more, you know where to find me!"
