50,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_GUTHJON_000_011","Before you set it in the Talos, would you take it to Magnus?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_GUTHJON_000_012","For three long years he's believed she died for nothing. He must know the truth─that her sacrifice was not in vain."

57,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_MAGNUS_000_031","If you've come to complain about the trolley, you'll find no sympathy from me. I told you before it won't run, and you wouldn't listen."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_THANCRED_000_032","Oh, but it will. Now that we have this."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_THANCRED_000_033","Your name is engraved on it, along with your son's. It was a gift from your wife, Magnus. From Agna."

70,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_THANCRED_000_050","Finally we can move on to Nabaath Areng. Assuming this works, of course."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_RYNE_000_055","Sorry I couldn't be of more help. By the sounds of it, you have a knack for handling strange requests."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_RYNE_000_056","On the bright side, Urianger taught me a lot about the Talos and their hearts. I think I can help if they need further repairs."

76,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_080","Thou art returned, and with leonine it would seem."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_081","As promised, the Talos hath been made ready to receive its heart, thanks in no small part to Jeryk, Thaffe, and Minfilia."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_082","At last we shall return time to the timeless, this sentinel of stone, that we may press on towards Nabaath Areng."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_083","Very good. Now, let us begin."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_THANCRED_000_090","I only want what's best for her. If only she could see that..."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_RYNE_000_095","<sniff> I'm fine. Really. It's just been a long day."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_MAGNUS_000_100","I must confess you've impressed me. I did not expect the Talos to be in such fine condition."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_THAFFE_000_105","You've done us a kindness far greater than anything we deserve. Thank you. Thank you so much."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_JERYK_000_110","Just thinking about the trolley running down the tracks, gears churning─gods, I can't stop smiling! "
85,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_120","Mine apologies for the delay. Minfilia and I had a private matter to discuss."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_121","Which bringeth me to the question─how didst thou find Thancred during your search?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_122","He spoke of Minfilia? Of his own accord? I see..."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_123","'Tis well that he did, and with such candor."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_124","I attempted to broach the subject before. Mine intention was to ensure no words remained unspoken between them, lest tragedy intercede. A regret I myself know all too well. Alas, in the end he refused to heed my counsel."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_125","A time will come when they must face the reality of their circumstances. But I have faith that all will be well in time..."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMD113_03618_URIANGER_000_126","Now, let us not tarry any longer. The Talos and Nabaath Areng await."
