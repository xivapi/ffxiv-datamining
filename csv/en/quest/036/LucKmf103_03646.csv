0,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_SEQ_00","Lyna urges you to follow her."
1,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_SEQ_01","Lyna is resolved to unlock the door to the Umbilicus. She bids you return to the Crystarium, and meet her in the Ocular."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_SEQ_02","You enter the heart of the Crystal Tower and a vision from the past washes over you. The Echo stretches on for what feels like many long minutes as you witness the Exarch reveal the truth of his motivations to a stunned Urianger. G'raha Tia─for that is the steward's true identity─speaks of an apocalyptic future in the Source, and of a determined group's efforts to bend time and space so that your life, and the lives of countless others, might be spared. Overwhelmed by the enormity of the endeavor, Urianger grimly agrees to conceal the truth from his fellow Scions, and to prevent them from interfering with the Exarch's planned act of self-sacrifice.

As you recover from the shock of these revelations, Ardbert appears and helps guide you towards a possible course of action. First things first, however, you must report to Lyna where she awaits you outside."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_SEQ_03","You speak with Lyna, and ask for the most direct means of reaching the Tempest. Somewhat taken aback by the request, the guard captain directs you to the tamers at the Amaro Launch."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_SEQ_04","Your attempts to secure an amaro for the forthcoming journey are interrupted by the arrival of your concerned comrades. You discuss your intention to press on despite your delicate condition, and the objections raised by Ryne are met with an impassioned argument from Alisaie. In the end, your companions agree to accompany you to the Tempest─an endeavor which gains the unexpected support of the Crystarium citizenry. They have long suspected your role as the Warrior of Darkness, and it seems you will not want for allies in the days ahead."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_SEQ_05","Although impressed by your determination, Urianger hints that he may have a less strenuous way of reaching the ocean floor. Before you discuss his solution, however, he suggests you conclude any pressing business you might have in the Crystarium."

64,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_ALPHINAUD_000_040","I once said that I wanted to fight for Estinien─that I wanted to save him, not let him be sacrificed for a cause. And now I say the same to you."

70,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_CASSARD_000_065","I might offer some words of encouragement to the masses while I'm out and about on business. You need proper support to do what you need to do, and we can't let morale start flagging now, can we?"
71,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_KATLISS_000_070","Not to worry─the Mean will keep the cogs greased and turning, as we always do. I'll see our crafting quotas are filled, and then some!"
72,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_CHESSAMILE_000_075","Hm? Do you need a tonic for your travels, sweetie? Oh, and maybe you should take one for the Exarch as well. Invigorating stuff if you can abide the smell..."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_SZEMDJENMAI_000_080","My fellow tamers and I will keep an eye on the horizon. Should the need arise, we shall speed to your side with a flock of amaro in tow."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_GLYNARD_000_085","A good, strong pint to see you down the road? ...Ah, best not, eh? You'll need your wits about you by the sound of things."

76,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_BRAGI_000_090","All stocked up on supplies then? Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it, as my old man used to say. Be safe, and bring the Exarch back to us..."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_URIANGER_000_100","Thou didst plan to commandeer an amaro for thy journey to the open sea? I fear the following dive down unto Emet-Selch's underwater abode would drain even thy legendary stamina..."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_URIANGER_000_101","Thus, during thy convalescence, we considered the most efficacious method for reaching the depths of the Tempest. And I believe we have arrived at an elegant solution."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMF103_03646_URIANGER_000_102","Yet ere we discuss this step, I suggest thou dost conclude such pressing business as remains to thee in the Crystarium. Once the sea closeth above our heads, we are unlikely to surface again until our grand deed is done."
