48,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_000","Answer me this, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>: when you were a child, what was your favorite dream you ever dreamed? Wait, you <Emphasis>were</Emphasis> a dreaming child once, yes? That's how it works, is it not?"
49,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_001","Anyhow, let me guess: you loved to dream of going on grand adventures. Journeying to the bottom of the deepest waters! Braving perilous ruins in search of ancient treasures! Why, that's what <Emphasis>I'd</Emphasis> like to dream of if I were a mortal child!"
50,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_002","Yes, I do believe that settles it: something precious from the ruins of the House of the First Light should be just what I need to spin the most stirring and dramatic dream ever! And <Emphasis>you're</Emphasis> going to bring it to me─for the children, of course!"
51,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_003","What sort of relic will make the children happy? Well, how should I know? Only one of us has been a mortal child once, and it certainly isn't me! Anyhow, I'll leave it up to you. If I don't like what you bring me, I'll just send you back for more! Tee hee!"
52,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_010","Ooh! You're back! Wait...back from where, again? Oh, that's right! Tell me: what wondrous relic did you find for me under the waters?"
53,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_011","Why, it's a teensy-weensy figure of a knight. How very interesting!"
54,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_012","They say that in the old days of Voeburt, people used to play a game where they moved these bitsy people around a board. It doesn't sound nearly as fun as spinning dreams, but to each their own, I suppose."
55,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_013","A silver ring...? It's so strangely cold to the touch. And these engravings..."
56,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_014","Ack! These runes are to ward away pixies! Whatever is the meaning of this, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!? Could it be that─gasp!─you don't like me as much as I like you?"
57,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_015","Why, it's an old Voeburtite coin! They say that back in the days of the Kingdom, you could buy all sorts of things with these. I haven't seen one of these in years..."
58,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_016","Anyhow, I simply must polish it up to the finest sheen! Only the very best for my dreamers!"
59,"TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_017","In any event, I do believe this will make for a most rousing treasure hunt for the children. If only you could be a child again, yes? I'd like nothing more than to spin you a dream as a token of my thanks!"
