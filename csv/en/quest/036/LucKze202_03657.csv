Quinfort is enamored with his new companion."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZE202_03657_SEQ_01","Valan is not sure what to make of the creature Quinfort has found, but decides to indulge his friend nonetheless. Their first task is to carry the beast to Slitherbough and away from possible danger and prying eyes. Valan finds the serpent-like creature repulsive, and Quinfort believes himself unworthy of holding it, which leaves you as the only one who can see the deed done.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

3,"TEXT_LUCKZE202_03657_SEQ_03","After a frightful journey, tiptoeing past treants and overgrown beetles, you arrive safely at Slitherbough with the burlap sack. You find Valan in the corner of a cave where the shadows will hopefully offer a modicum of privacy. He suggests taking the snakelike creature out of the sack to ensure it is still in one piece."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZE202_03657_SEQ_04","Quinfort arrives not long after you, enthralled by what he believes to be a divine beast of the Greatwood. Valan continues to make light of the situation, but Quinfort assures him that he will save Slitherbough with the aid of the great serpent. "
