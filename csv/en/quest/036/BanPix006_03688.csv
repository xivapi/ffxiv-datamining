※You may enter Lyhe Mheg by speaking with Thon Sul in Lydha Lran.
※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

Though they no longer see Titania's dreams, the will of the departed monarch lives on in them, and they intend to honor it by watching over Lyhe Mheg. You then take your leave, safe in the knowledge that the Garden of Dreams is in good hands."
3,"TEXT_BANPIX006_03688_SEQ_03","Back outside in Lydha Lran, Tyr Beq muses on the connection that pixies and mortals share in dreams before bidding you farewell for now. Together with their fellow Dreamspinners, Tyr Beq will continue working to make dreams fun and beautiful, and suffice it to say your help shall ever be welcome in their endeavor."
