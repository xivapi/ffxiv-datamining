0,"TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_SEQ_00","The Adventurers' Guild investigator is suspicious of something else, now.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_SEQ_01","Upon inquiring as to what the investigator's other concerns regarding the Continental Circus might be, he explains that he has cause to believe that would-be attendees of their masquerade are being spirited away to another location entirely─and that said location is fraught with fiends and other dangers. He requests that you, in the name of public safety, infiltrate this apparently haunted manor to ensure that no victims have been trapped within.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_SEQ_02","At the investigator's suggestion, you speak with the enthralling illusionist, who appears genuinely quite delighted to explain how you might enter the manor─by simply asking a harlequin guide to escort you. She also cautions, however, that you had best understand the rules to the extent that your mundane consciousness allows if you intend to survive it..."

49,"TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_INVESTIGATOR03670_000_001","I know not whether you yourself have yet received an invitation, but the troupe is once again hosting a masquerade event in a vacant manor nearby. Now, we've received no complaints this year from those who have <Emphasis>successfully</Emphasis> attended this event. However..."

51,"TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_INVESTIGATOR03670_000_003","I grant that some people enjoy that sort of thing, bizarre though it may be. However, the guild would be remiss were we not to ensure that none have become lost or trapped in such a clearly unsafe location."
52,"TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_INVESTIGATOR03670_000_004","We can hardly ask the troupe for its cooperation in this matter, as I doubt that their intentions in terrifying unsuspecting revelers are pure.

Over the course of my observing the troupe's movements, I have seen her conversing with at least two people that would later report having been to the haunted manor."
54,"TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_INVESTIGATOR03670_000_010","To be quite honest, if you were to ask nicely, the illusionist might be willing to take you to the haunted manor straightaway. They're not the brightest, these fiends."
