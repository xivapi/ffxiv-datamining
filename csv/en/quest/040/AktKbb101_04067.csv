※This quest will unlock the sage job."
1,"TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_SEQ_01","As you make your way through the lower decks of Limsa Lominsa, an outlandishly dressed maiden catches your eye. Curiosity piqued, you approach her and learn that she is Lalah Jinjahl, a Sharlayan operative come to Eorzea on a Forum-sanctioned mission to capture fugitives. Lalah seeks an adventurer to serve as her escort, and you agree to lend her your aid. Before divulging the particulars of the mission, she suggests moving to more private surrounds, and you head outside the Zephyr Gate to continue your conversation."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_SEQ_02","The fugitives Lalah hunts are dangerous individuals who have enhanced themselves via forbidden means─means which have rendered them unsound of mind. One committed murder while in a state of delirium, and though he subsequently died, three others remain at large. They have also stolen technical secrets in the form of a sage's soul crystal, and when Lalah makes to show you another, the stone appears to react to your presence. Convinced that you are meant to have it, she offers to bestow the crystal upon you─if you would swear to use the sage's art only for good."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_SEQ_03","Having given Lalah's offer due consideration, you make your pledge and accept her gift of the soul crystal along with a set of sage's garments. She then bids you take up the stone and don your attire, that your training as a sage may begin."
