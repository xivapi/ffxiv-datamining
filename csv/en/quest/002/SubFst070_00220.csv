49,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_GONTRANT_000_2","Guildleves are the means by which we document requests for assistance from the citizenry, prior to assigning them to adventurers possessed of the necessary skills."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_GONTRANT_000_3","From “battlecraft leves” that require the extermination of monsters, to “tradecraft leves” that ask for the creation of goods, the tasks we term “levequests” are many and varied in their nature."
51,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_GONTRANT_000_4","Should your interest be piqued, I suggest you make your way to Bentbranch Meadows and speak with Tierney. She will be happy to set your feet on the path to completing your first levequest."
52,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_10","Greetings, adventurer. My name is Tierney, and I am in charge of assigning local levequests here at Bentbranch Meadows."
53,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_11","Gontrant convinced you to seek me out, did he? Then I shall assume you have a basic understanding of what accepting a guildleve might entail."
54,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_12","But first things first: I must be certain that your skills are a match for your enthusiasm. The Adventurers' Guild would not approve of me sending a fledgling hero to <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> death or dishonor for want of the requisite capabilities."
55,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_13","Take a moment to peruse the task outlined in this guildleve. Do you believe yourself up to the challenge?"
56,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_14","I am glad to hear it. Pray be aware, however, that anoles are wont to flee to their broodmates when they sense they are overmatched. You would be wise to prevent such a reunion, lest the battle be drawn out past your limits of endurance."
57,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_SYSTEM_000_15","Open your journal under Duty in the main menu, and begin the selected levequest by pressing the “Initiate” button."
58,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_SYSTEM_000_16","When an anole feels overmatched, it will flee the battle. If it reaches a certain distance, then another anole will appear. The levequest objective can be more easily achieved by slaying the fleeing creature before it is joined by more of its kind."
59,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_20","Ah, your first foray into the world of levequests appears to have been a success. And here is the reward for your efforts."

63,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_24","If you wish to know more, pray speak with Battlewarden Ribald in yonder tent. I will inform him of your success against the anoles so that there are no doubts as to your abilities."
