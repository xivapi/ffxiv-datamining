1,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_SEQ_01","Fafafono has asked you to slay rusty coblyns and gather four bottles of coblyn grease."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_SEQ_02","You have collected the coblyn grease Fafafono requested. Deliver it to Adelard at the Hammers."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_SEQ_03","Adelard is happy to receive the coblyn grease, and is thankful to you and Fafafono for acquiring it. He explains that the hammers are creating a foundation on which estates for Ul'dahns of considerable means are to be built. Of course, not everybody is excited at this proposition, such as the Silver Bazaar's own Kikipu. It would seem that not everybody's idea of progress is the same."

49,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_FAFAFONO_002","All you need do is slay enough rusty coblyns to gather four bottles of coblyn grease, and then deliver them to a Hyur by the name of Adelard at the Hammers. Once he has the grease, he can use it to keep the hammers running. It couldn't be more simple!"
50,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_FAFAFONO_003","I'm surrounded by fools here. They detest the hammers and the new way of life they symbolize. They care only for the successes of the past, but it blinds them to the opportunities of the present. Change isn't coming, friend─it's already here!"

54,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_ADELARD_003","Before long, these tracts will be covered with the estates of Ul'dahn elite. But the ground is still too loose to build upon. The hammers are pounding to make a solid foundation. Once that's done, then you'll see the structures start to rise."
55,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_ADELARD_004","The building was planned to stretch even farther─to the heart of the Silver Bazaar, even. But it seems the powers that be are being met with some...local resistance."
56,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_ADELARD_005","I hear some lass named Kikipu holds the rights to the bulk of the land there. Stubborn to a fault, that one. A bloody thorn in the side."
