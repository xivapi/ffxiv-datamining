1,"TEXT_SUBWIL034_00226_SEQ_01","Four laborers who tend the derricks are taking an elongated break in the Silver Bazaar, and testing Kikipu's last nerve in the process. Chase them out of the Bazaar by casting /doubt on the validity of their actions, the purpose of their presence, and the very nature of their existence."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL034_00226_SEQ_02","You have rid the Silver Bazaar of the surly derrick workers. Run and tell Kikipu of your feat."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL034_00226_SEQ_03","It seems the laborers were not laborers at all, but cowardly thugs hired to disguise themselves as laborers and prospect land in secret. Here's hoping nothing further comes of the incident..."

50,"TEXT_SUBWIL034_00226_KIKIPU_003","But they're no workers. They're nothing but hired muscle sent to threaten the people of the Bazaar and harass our shops. It's not the first time."
