53,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_6","As I believe I mentioned, he is passionate about cookery, and has little patience for those who show anything less than absolute commitment to the craft.

56,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_13","...Hahaha! I jest, I jest... <sigh> It don't take muscle to be a culinarian. 'Ells, it don't even take talent─'least not on its own."
