50,"TEXT_FESXMS004_00250_XAVALIEN_100_001","The principal hero of the tale─a snowy-bearded captain─is often referred to as the “Saint of Nymeia,” for it was by his unorthodox order that the wayward waifs were given food and shelter. The compassionate acts of this saint and his soldiers are now honored by an annual tradition, wherein gifts are given to younglings during the coldest days of the year."

As is the custom, the Starlight celebrant and her colleagues have donned scarlet apparel reminiscent of the jackets worn by those charitable knights─the saint's “little helpers,” so to speak. Thus attired, they plan to distribute gifts to every child who writes a letter to Nymeia, patron goddess of celestial wonders."
