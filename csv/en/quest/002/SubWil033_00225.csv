1,"TEXT_SUBWIL033_00225_SEQ_01","Fafafono is the sad victim of some baggage haulers having left their work undone. His wares lie beyond the gates, undelivered and unguarded. Gather the three pieces of said baggage and deliver them to their worried owner."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL033_00225_SEQ_02","You have picked up all of the abandoned baggage. See the bags safely back to the fretful Fafafono."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL033_00225_SEQ_03","Fafafono's baggage contains miswoven articles of clothing from Sunsilk Tapestries. To the isolated people of the Silver Bazaar, however, the fact that they are brand-name goods is all that matters."

55,"TEXT_SUBWIL033_00225_FAFAFONO_015","Everyone clings to the glories of the golden past, yet none make efforts to reshape the dismal present. I pray this damnable Bazaar someday sinks beneath the sands that strangle it. The sooner the better."
