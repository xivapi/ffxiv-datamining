1,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_SEQ_01","Danyell believes that his fisherman father has been stuck on land of late because his compass is broken. Venture outside the Silver Bazaar and see if you can find three chunks of magnetite to fix the broken instrument."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_SEQ_02","You have collected three chunks of magnetite. Deliver them to Galfridus at the Silver Bazaar."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_SEQ_03","The magnetite you supplied can be used to mend the damaged compass. Tragically, however, there does not seem to be much use for it once repaired."

51,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_DANYELL_004","Such stones can be found near the lighthouse, but the search is not without its dangers. The area is rife with earth sprites drawn to the magnetism. I'm a lowly fisherman's son. I have no arm for fighting, nor the stomach."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_DANYELL_005","Three chunks of magnetite would serve to mend the compass. Once you find them, please take them to my father, Galfridus. No doubt he'll be dawdling about the Bazaar, as always."

55,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_GALFRIDUS_003","I've a vessel what's barely seaworthy, an' scarce big enough for me alone. I've no crew, no hands to help with the haul. All bloody day at sea bustin' me arse gets me a few gil at best."
56,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_GALFRIDUS_004","Gods, days ain't what they were. Time was ye could scarce count the ships what used to make berth here. There weren't no empty coinpurse or stomach in all the Bazaar."
57,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_GALFRIDUS_005","Small ships ain't got no place at sea no more. E'erywhere I go, I'm in the shadow or wake of some monstrous trawler or seiner. The old ways're done. We li'l fishermen done lost our way."
58,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_GALFRIDUS_006","I ain't no fisherman no more, nor much of a father, I s'pose. Just a broken man with a broken compass an' broken dreams."
