1,"TEXT_CLSBSM101_00294_SEQ_01","Having singularly failed to articulate his blacksmithing philosophy, Brithael irritatedly bids you craft a dozen bronze rivets. Prepare the requested items and deliver them to him."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM101_00294_SEQ_02","Brithael pronounces your rivets perfect before illustrating the importance of high-quality craftsmanship with another of his odd yet effective examples. Now that you have gained sufficient experience, he suggests that you try marketing your skills to other Lominsans by speaking with T'mokkri at the Drowning Wench.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 15."
