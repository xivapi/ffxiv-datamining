0,"TEXT_CLSARM301_00280_SEQ_00","In a bid to quell mutinous murmurings within the guild, Forgemaster H'naanza has decided to entrust you with a prestigious commission."
1,"TEXT_CLSARM301_00280_SEQ_01","H'naanza has asked you to undertake the commission of a wealthy and highly respected client on her behalf. To learn more about the job, make your way to the Fishermen's Guild and seek out Nortyrwyb, the customer's maidservant."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM301_00280_SEQ_02","Upon arriving at the Fishermen's Guild, a rather nonplussed Nortyrwyb explains that Blanstyr has already accepted her master's commission as the armorers' appointed representative. Clearly, there has been some sort of misunderstanding... Track the veteran craftsman down and attempt to resolve the matter."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM301_00280_SEQ_03","In order to decide who should have the honor of taking the commission, Blanstyr proposes a contest of skill. Craft an all-surpassing suit of steel chainmail and deliver it to the Roegadyn artisan for appraisal alongside his own work."
4,"TEXT_CLSARM301_00280_SEQ_04","Blanstyr is both impressed and dismayed by the quality of your chainmail. Though he admits defeat, it is plain that the old artisan has no intention of putting the matter behind him. You have acquired a bitter rival this day. Continue to strive for mastery over your craft and prepare yourself for the inevitable confrontation to come.

※The next armorer quest will be available from H'naanza upon reaching level 35."

I need hardly add that I would not entrust this commission to an armorer in whom I had aught less than the utmost faith."
