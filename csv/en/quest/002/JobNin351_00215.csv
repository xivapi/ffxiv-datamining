By forming the mudra Ten and Chi─in that order─you can channel the power of heaven and earth to wield the ninjutsu Raiton, or lightning release. Demonstrate the technique for Oboro on the mokujin outside the storehouse."
2,"TEXT_JOBNIN351_00215_SEQ_02","You have successfully wielded Raiton, sending crackling bolts of lightning coursing through the mokujin, whose wooden limbs thankfully feel no pain. Speak with Oboro to hear his assessment of your technique."

By reversing the order and forming the mudra for Chi followed by Ten, you can wield the ninjutsu Katon, or fire release. Unleash the skill on the poor mokujin, who clearly has not taken enough punishment."

Wielding your newfound talents to the best of your ability, you and Oboro manage to stand your ground against this formidable foe, who departs the scene with a swift stealthiness reminiscent of his namesake. Take a deep breath, calm your mind, and speak with Oboro to hear his thoughts on these events."
7,"TEXT_JOBNIN351_00215_SEQ_07","Oboro expresses his displeasure at his own carelessness and inability to foresee Karasu's ambush. Accompany him back to the dock storehouse to regroup and assess your next course of action."
8,"TEXT_JOBNIN351_00215_SEQ_08","Oboro reflects upon the events at the falls, and surmises from Karasu's words and actions that your foe sought not to kill you, but merely to test your strength. At the same time, he reaffirms his belief that you will prove a valuable ally to the two Domans in their mission of vengeance, and encourages you to continue to hone your skills.

※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 40."
