0,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_SEQ_00","Hien is mulling over the details of Alphinaud's linkpearl call."
1,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_SEQ_01","Based on your information, Hien is of the opinion that Alphinaud indeed encountered some manner of trouble at the Burn. He suggests conducting a search of the wasteland upon flying mounts, and Yugiri bids you see to your preparations before joining them at the overlook near the House of the Fierce."
2,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_SEQ_02","The party is assembled, as are the birds that will carry you. It is time to set out for the Burn in search of Alphinaud.

※Challenge the Burn with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point."
3,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_SEQ_03","Scant moments after arriving at the Burn, you are caught in the midst of a fierce sandstorm which forces you to land. With no other recourse, you fight your way through hordes of fearsome desert creatures, as well as machina, inside what appear to be Allagan ruins. At length you emerge in an area of relative safety, and it is then that you spy the remains of the airship which bore Alphinaud away in the distance. Evidence of a battle abounds, but your friend and his traveling companions are nowhere to be seen. At Y'shtola's prompting, the party proceeds to scour the area for clues."
4,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_SEQ_04","Judging by the insignia upon a fallen soldier's uniform, Alphinaud's party came under attack from the Emperor's personal guard. While the implications of this discovery are unsettling, there is little more to be done at the crash site, and Yugiri suggests returning to the Doman Enclave to consider your next move."
5,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_SEQ_05","The journey back to Doma proves blessedly uneventful, and Hien is visibly relieved."

55,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_YSHTOLA_000_022","The Burn offers a glimpse of the future we seek to prevent. Know you of any reason why Alphinaud might have gone there?"
56,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_HIEN_000_023","Aye. Mischance. Though it lies on the route to Garlemald, it is no place to make a stop. My guess is they encountered some manner of trouble there."
57,"TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_HIEN_000_024","In any event, I am of the same mind as Alisaie─we have no choice but to take our search to the Burn. Given the considerable distances involved, 'tis best we went by bird."
