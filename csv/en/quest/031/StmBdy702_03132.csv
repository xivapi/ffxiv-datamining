1,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_SEQ_01","Having returned from the thirtieth floor of Heaven–on–High, you seek out Kyusei to deliver your report. However, he seems uninterested in discussing your findings and, surprisingly, admits that not everything he has told you thus far has been the truth. He seems even more furtive than usual as he asks you to meet him in a secluded area of the coastline, presumably to discuss the circumstances surrounding the tower."
2,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_SEQ_02","Rasho arrives at the agreed location accompanied by Kyusei and two other Confederates, with all but Rasho dressed in unusual, matching attire. Kyusei reveals that he and his similarly clothed companions are in fact members of the Onishishu, a clandestine organization that researches ancient relics and maintains the aetherytes of Othard. He goes on to explain that Heaven–on–High was built thousands of years ago by his predecessors as a proving ground for warriors who would one day become protectors of the realm. The founder of the Confederacy was one such warrior and succeeded in besting Hiruko, the guardian of the thirtieth floor, before devoting his life to protecting the Ruby Sea. The Confederacy and the Onishishu have shared close ties ever since, and each Confederate leader must follow the founder's example by battling Hiruko. Kyusei hints at further mysteries involving Hiruko and the tower itself, the answers to which can be found at the Ten–thousand–year Pine."
3,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_SEQ_03","The Ten–thousand–year Pine conceals a device that projects images recorded in the days following the fall of the Allagan Empire. You witness a conversation between a man who appears to be the founder of the Onishishu and one of his apprentices. It is revealed that he gave his life to activate Hiruko, an artificial being created to face those who would challenge Heaven–on–High. Following the noble scholar's final soliloquy, the recording comes to a close and the Ten–thousand–year Pine falls silent once more."
4,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_SEQ_04","Kyusei is pleased that you have seen the recording left by the Onishishu founder. He reminds you that defeating Hiruko is but a malmstone in the ascent of Heaven–on–High, and that greater challenges lie ahead. Upon hearing this, you cannot help but wonder what formidable foes await in the upper reaches of Heaven–on–High."

55,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_023","Ours is a sacred brotherhood which has endured for millennia. That we may safeguard our knowledge, we side with no nation and strive to remain neutral in political affairs.

58,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_026","In all fairness, I should like to think we all serve the realm in our own way.

60,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_028","Very few people know this, but this tower was built as a training ground thousands of years ago by the founding members of the Onishishu. They foresaw that a great calamity would befall this star and in preparation sought to instruct warriors in warcraft."
61,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_RASHO_000_029","To keep the island free of intruders, tales of holy-this and sacred-that were spread throughout the Ruby Sea. Only the truly fearless would dare approach."

63,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_RASHO_000_031","Abandoning his conquest of the tower, he decided to become a protector of the Ruby Sea. Every Confederate leader since has used the thirtieth floor as the yalmstick by which we measure ourselves. And, like him, we aid the Onishishu in their search for would-be heroes."
64,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_032","The higher-ups of your organization have always been our staunchest supporters, allowing us to go about our work while we ostensibly serve as members of your crew.

65,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_033","Yes, like Rasho and the pirate captains before him, you bested Hiruko. He looked into your soul and found you worthy. Were you found wanting, well...I am sure you can guess the fate of those who do not pass muster."
66,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_034","Yet his is a tragic tale. For one of our revered predecessors made the ultimate sacrifice so that Hiruko may be given life."

88,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_RASHO_000_071","I can tell you're cut from a different cloth, though. If the rumors about you are true, you could be exactly what the Onishishu have been searching for all these years."
89,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_080","So, what did you think? The millennia that have passed since the recording have not aged our founder one bit. Ah, the wonders of ancient technology... A pity it is only a projection, though."
90,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_081","Hiruko is also looking rather well for his age. Of course, that can be attributed to the automated systems that revive him after every defeat."
91,"TEXT_STMBDY702_03132_KYUSEI_000_082","Provided that the machinery is carefully maintained, Hiruko should continue to function as judge─and in most cases, executioner─of those who would climb the tower. That is, until the trials of Heaven–on–High are no longer necessary."
