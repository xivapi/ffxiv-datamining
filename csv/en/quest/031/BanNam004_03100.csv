1,"TEXT_BANNAM004_03100_SEQ_01","Gyoshin is on the point of relaying another dire warning imparted by his ancestor when Seigetsu the Enlightened, having detected a familiar pattern, interjects to hasten matters along. He recommends that Gyoshin look into the Xaela's traditions, which may have been influenced by those of the Namazu long ago, for clues as to what vital element might be missing from the festival. Gyoshin, however, refuses to go without your protection, lest the Xaela get any ideas about their evening meal.

Perhaps sensing the intent behind her hungry stare, Gyoshin thanks her and asks that you set off for your next destination, the Dawn Throne, immediately."

5,"TEXT_BANNAM004_03100_SEQ_05","Based on what the Xaela said of their own traditions, the Namazu conclude that a proper festival must include fins-on activities for attendees. Without sparing a thought for such seemingly vital questions as, “Is it possible to pull a bow without getting one's whiskers tangled in the string?” and “Are horses not a bit high off the ground?” the Namazu decide to copy the three Xaela tribes' competitions wholesale. You have been tasked with preparing for the archery contest together with Gyoshin."
6,"TEXT_BANNAM004_03100_SEQ_06","Once all materials for the ceremonial bow and arrows are assembled, Gyoshin excitedly reveals what he has been working on in the meantime─a target.
