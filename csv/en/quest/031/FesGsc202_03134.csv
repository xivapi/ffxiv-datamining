※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESGSC202_03134_SEQ_01","The moogles are free to enjoy the sights and sounds of the Gold Saucer at their leisure. As the moogle maiden runs off, excited to begin their romp through the grounds, the moogle suitor makes a confession. The purpose for their coming to the Saucer is so he can ask for her paw in marriage. Before that can happen, however, he wishes to take her on the perfect romantic outing, and he needs your help. Having laid bare his plans, he rushes after his love to Event Square.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESGSC202_03134_SEQ_02","Their outing will begin with the Moogle's Paw. Or so they think. When they arrive, the machine is already in use. The moogle suitor suggests they patiently wait their turn, but so long as they remain hidden, the moogle maiden fears the patrons in front of them may never realize others are waiting. Fearing his lady love grows despondent, the moogle suitor excuses himself to seek your advice. He follows your words to the letter, and he seems to have pleased his companion as a result. Seeking a brief respite, they make for Wonder Square."
3,"TEXT_FESGSC202_03134_SEQ_03","At last, they have a chance to rest. The view from the upper floor of Wonder Square is beautiful, and the moogle suitor intends to make the most of the moment. At a loss as to how to do that, he once again turns to you for sage council. Your plan seems to have worked. All things considered, the moogle maiden appears to be enjoying herself. They prepare to return to Entrance Square, where the moogle suitor plans to make a bold move."
4,"TEXT_FESGSC202_03134_SEQ_04","You offer the moogle suitor a few final words of encouragement. Emboldened, he returns to the moogle maiden to profess his love, and ask her to marry him. The result is...not what you expected. But regardless of the dubious outcome, the couple is pleased with how the day turned out."
5,"TEXT_FESGSC202_03134_SEQ_05","The moogle suitor did not woo his lady love as he had hoped, but he is not a quitter. As they plan to remain at the Gold Saucer a while longer, perhaps there is hope he will win her heart. With your help, of course."
