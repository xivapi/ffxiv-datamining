49,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_001","As you are doubtless aware, the Namazu tribe originated on this very steppe, and traces of our heritage remain to this day. The pilgrimage will involve paying visit to those spiritual locations where our ancestors once trod. Well, swam. You take my meaning."
50,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_002","Our traditions include a particular orison: “In his whiskers' name.” Speak these words where the Hak Khaal cascades into the Sea of Blades, and at the shrine of Chakha Zoh. Of course, you are free to embellish on the prayer if you find it lacking in sophistication. I often do so myself."
51,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_GUARD03104_005","Here we honor noble Chakha, so she may rest ever in glory. Never shall those who come to pay respects be turned away."
52,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_WORSHIPNAMAZUO03104_006","This is apparently one of the Namazu's most holy, holiest of places. I will pray with gusto! In his whiskers' name, yes, yes."

54,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_GUARD03104_011","Several Namazu have come here recently, speaking words solemn and strange─much like you did just now. It would seem that this place holds some significance to them."
55,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_GUARD03104_012","What that might be, I cannot imagine. Chakha Zoh enshrines the bones of the wyrmslayer Chakha, a woman bold yet wise. She was by no means an associate of the Namazu."

57,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_WORSHIPNAMAZUO03104_000_021","Oh, are you a fellow pilgrim? According to Seigetsu the Enlightened, long, long ago this was the site of a fierce battle between clansmen."
58,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_WORSHIPNAMAZUO03104_000_022","The victors became our Namazu ancestors. Yes, yes. The others swam down this waterfall in defeat, and eventually became underworld catfish. But could catfish really live beneath the ground? It seems unrealistic to me."

63,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_041","Please avert your disapproving glare. Pilgrimages require holy sites. It is hardly my fault that no written records regarding those of antiquity are extant."
64,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_042","In any case, the authenticity of the sites is irrelevant so long as pilgrims have a meaningful spiritual experience on which to build. Hingan traditions may be sophisticated now, but their ancients found spirituality through the worship of mountains, trees, and even fish. Fish!"
