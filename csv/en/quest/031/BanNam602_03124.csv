48,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_000","Ah, what fortuitous timing. You recall our recent rehearsal for the archery game taught to us by the Dotharl, yes? Simple though it may be, I took it upon myself to modify their techniques to better suit our soon-to-be refined tastes. "
49,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_001","Indeed, I have done all I can so that even the likes of Gyoshin should have no trouble participating, yet it seems my kin are wholly inept at this seemingly facile skill."
50,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_002","To remedy this problem, I would have them bear witness once more to your exceptional marksmanship. Gyobi awaits you at the shooting gallery, hopefully with pen and paper to take notes."
51,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_GYOBI_000_010","Thank you for coming. We're all quite excited to see your skill with a bow. Yes, yes, delighted. I realize I'm the only one watching, but...I'm quite sure that's how the others feel."
52,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_GYOBI_000_011","Whenever you're ready, take aim and fire away!"
53,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_SYSTEM_000_012","Take aim at the Festival Targets, zoom in to avoid accidents, and fire with <If(Equal(PlayerParameter(80),0))><UIForeground>F20222</UIForeground><UIForeground>01</UIForeground><Else/><CommandIcon(15)/> / <CommandIcon(8)/></If>."

56,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_A1_000_001","I hold my breath."
57,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_A1_000_002","I calm my spirit and focus."
58,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_A1_000_003","It's all in the wrist!"
59,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_GYOBI_000_021","Of course! By holding your breath it's easier to keep still. Yes, yes. Unmoving like stone."
60,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_GYOBI_000_022","Calm your spirit, you say? And focus... Now that you mention it, the look in your eyes was rather intense. Yes, yes. Like Seigetsu when he's reading his favorite books."
61,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_GYOBI_000_023","Your wrists...? Ah, your wrist bands! I see. I never realized the answer could be so simple."
62,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_GYOBI_000_024","You've given me much to think on─a treasure trove of knowledge to digest. I'll be sure to share everything you've taught me with the others."
63,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_GYOBI_000_025","Thank you again for the archery lesson. We have much to practice before the festival. Yes, yes."
64,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_030","I could hear Gyobi's cries of admiration from here. No doubt she's been duly inspired by your prowess."
65,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_031","Though there still remains the matter of finding a bow that isn't unwieldy in our fins."
66,"TEXT_BANNAM602_03124_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_032","Or perhaps we needn't use a bow at all. We could use something smaller, like a pistol! But first I must find volunteers to serve as targets..."
