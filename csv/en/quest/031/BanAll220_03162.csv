1,"TEXT_BANALL220_03162_SEQ_01","You speak with J'olhmyn, who has little patience for delays─particularly those that come in the form of M'zhet. She dashes off toward the Ruby Price almost the instant you suggest it as a likely spot to find eyewitnesses, leaving him struggling to keep up."
2,"TEXT_BANALL220_03162_SEQ_02","You meet with J'olhmyn and M'zhet, the latter of whom seems to have recovered his senses, if not his good sense. As time is of the essence, the former suggests that the three of you split up to more efficiently speak with those manning the Ruby Price and search for any other clues that may be present in the vicinity."
3,"TEXT_BANALL220_03162_SEQ_03","Though you speak with several people zealously undertaking their duties at the Ruby Price, they assure you that no one matching Nhaza'a Jaab's description has passed through the area. Disappointing though the result may be, it at least narrows the range of potential routes he may have taken across the Ruby Sea."
4,"TEXT_BANALL220_03162_SEQ_04","Midway through reporting the results─or notable lack thereof─of your investigation to J'olhmyn, you hear M'zhet's scream ring through the salty air. Rushing to its source, you find him being menaced by none other than Kabuto, who has evidently mistaken him for the man who stole Tsukumo─or rather, the materia that once was the kami's soul─right from the Kojin's helmet. Thankfully, your presence causes him to realize his error sooner rather than later, and the initial misunderstanding is soon forgotten. As it appears that the one who purloined Tsukumo and Alpa's kidnapper are one and the same, Kabuto eagerly joins you in your continued search for Nhaza'a Jaab."
5,"TEXT_BANALL220_03162_SEQ_05","On Kabuto's recommendation, you make your way to the fishing village of Isari, again in search of eyewitnesses. Perhaps your inquiries will bear more fruit this time around."
6,"TEXT_BANALL220_03162_SEQ_06","Upon questioning, one of the villagers claims to have seen a man with the characteristics you describe. Though he was apparently not accompanied by a mermaid, given the rarity of Miqo'te in the Far East and the man in question's peculiar fashion sense, it is all but certain that Nhaza'a Jaab indeed passed through Isari, and thereafter headed for either the Azim Steppe or Yanxia. Though the other fisherfolk can provide you with no additional information as to the villain's whereabouts, one man does mention a curious legend of potential note─that of the Three Wonders. According to the fisherman, these mythical treasures─which include the flesh of a mermaid─have been the subject of much gossip of late, as a certain noble lady has made their provision a requirement of those who would claim her hand in marriage."
7,"TEXT_BANALL220_03162_SEQ_07","As you discuss your findings with your companions, Kabuto reveals that he is familiar with folklore regarding the Three Wonders, and that, in addition to Merflesh, the Jewel of Fair Souls and the Philosopher's Fin are counted among their number. He and J'olhmyn theorize that, due to Alpa's oft-remarked-upon resemblance to a mermaid of Far Eastern legend and Tsukumo's rare nature, it may be possible to pass them off as two of the three treasures to a gullible recipient. What Nhaza'a Jaab's ultimate goal in doing so might be remains shrouded in mystery, but if he is indeed collecting counterfeits of the Wonders, it is imperative that Alpa be rescued before her flesh can be separated from her person."
