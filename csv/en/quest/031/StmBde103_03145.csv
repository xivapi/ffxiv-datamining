57,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_ALISAIE_000_023","Of course─if you think it will be useful."
58,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_HIEN_000_024","Thank you. Let us return to my manor, then."
59,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_ALISAIE_000_040","Yugiri assures me the task of searching is best left to her comrades. I shall trust to their experience and focus on what I can do."
60,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_YSHTOLA_000_045","That the Alliance would extend an invitation to Doma bespeaks the depth of their concern. Nor are they misguided. If Garlemald has fallen under Ascian control, the threat we face is incalculable."

66,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_HIEN_000_073","I thank you for coming, Lyse─even if it was on official business. I had hoped there might be time to show you the land you helped to save, but I will settle for a fleeting visit if needs must."

68,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_LYSE_000_075","...Um, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? I was wondering if I might have a word with you before I go. In private."
69,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_HIEN_000_076","Go on, my friend. I will send for Hakuro and the others in the meantime."

73,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_HAKURO_000_095","So the Eorzean Alliance has invited Doma to attend a council. I had wondered if that might be the purpose of Mistress Lyse's visit."

76,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_LYSE_000_102","The Alisaie I know is overbearing, willful, and reckless─and that's <Emphasis>fine</Emphasis>. It's how she deals with feeling weak. She has to keep moving, or she's afraid she'll fall apart."

78,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_LYSE_000_104","But the thing about people like us is that we need someone to keep an eye on us. I had Papalymo, and now I have my friends in the Resistance. And Alisaie has you and the Scions."

83,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_LYSE_000_110","Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It goes without saying, but if there's anything <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> can do, you only need to ask."

91,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_YUGIRI_000_140","Your return is most timely. We have just apprised those newly arrived of where matters stand."
92,"TEXT_STMBDE103_03145_HAKURO_000_145","We all had our suspicions from the start, but a part of me was credulous enough to believe the Empire's promises. Never again. The imperial court is a nest of vipers, and any peace they offer is laced with poison."
