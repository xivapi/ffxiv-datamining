※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW502_03170_SEQ_01","Having consulted her network of manor furnishings, Little Yin reports details regarding the true forms of those malevolent mummers who she believes to possess useful information. You also learn that assorted decorations have taken to using transfiguration magicks bestowed by the pumpkin-headed apparition, so you need only speak with one in order to be transformed into a convincingly freakish fiend.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

The former reacts with an uncharacteristic show of enthusiasm, while the latter reveals that he was not, in fact, paying attention. For both of their sakes, you agree to calmly review what you have learned so far before proceeding to the next phase of the plan."
