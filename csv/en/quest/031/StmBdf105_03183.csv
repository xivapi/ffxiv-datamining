1,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_SEQ_01","The hour of battle has arrived at last. Together with a contingent of Doman soldiers, you and your comrades make for the Ghimlyt Dark, and the front lines of battle.

※Challenge the Ghimlyt Dark with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point."
2,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_SEQ_02","Chaos erupts from all sides as you wage your way through the Ghimlyt Dark. Though the imperials send wave after wave of soldiers against you and your allies, their forces are still found wanting. They eventually concede defeat and begin a hasty retreat."
3,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_SEQ_03","Just as you are making ready to give chase, your minds are assailed once again by a mysterious voice. When the pain subsides, you find Alisaie lifeless on the ground."
4,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_SEQ_04","Thanks to your efforts, the Garlean forces have retreated, offering the Alliance a brief reprieve. While discussing the present state of the battle against Garlemald, Yugiri returns from the infirmary with distressing news─the chirurgeons can find no cause for Alisaie's affliction. With five of the Scions now fallen, Raubahn suspects you may be shaken, and exhausted besides. With no further signs of Garlean movement, he bids you rest for the interim."
5,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_SEQ_05","You return to the Rising Stones and speak with Hoary Boulder, who is dismayed to hear that Alisaie too has succumbed to the deathless sleep that has taken hold of the others. Though Krile and the other remaining Scions have yet to find a remedy, he believes all hope is not yet lost. For now, however, all you can do is wait."

52,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_RAUBAHN_000_010","So the Garleans have been routed, have they? Well done."
53,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_RAUBAHN_000_011","Though this exchange was no more than a test of our strength, like as not. They won't be taking any chances now that the Emperor has joined the fray. They'll want to take their time─whittle down our defenses..."
54,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_RAUBAHN_000_012","Still, with your help, and that of our Eastern allies, we've passed the first test. Our line is unbroken."

56,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_YUGIRI_000_014","My lord─the chirurgeons have completed their examination of Mistress Alisaie, and it is as we feared. She is locked in a slumber without any outward cause."
57,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_HIEN_000_015","Just like the others. Damn it all..."
58,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_RAUBAHN_000_016","Aye...the Garleans picked a fine time to come knocking."
59,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_RAUBAHN_000_017","Five Scions incapacitated... And with the enemy on our doorstep, I cannot spare the men to assist in the search for a cure. The best I can do is see to it that Alisaie is escorted safely back to the Rising Stones."
60,"TEXT_STMBDF105_03183_HIEN_000_018","Yugiri and I would return to our encampment. The main contingent of our forces from the Far East is under sail, and all must be made ready for their arrival."
