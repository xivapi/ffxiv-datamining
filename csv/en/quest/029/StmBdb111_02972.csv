1,"TEXT_STMBDB111_02972_SEQ_01","Wary of Qalyana treachery, Raubahn is minded to bolster security for the forthcoming meeting. Arenvald duly volunteers to round up your fellow Scions, and bids you assemble with them in the Ala Mhigan Quarter."
2,"TEXT_STMBDB111_02972_SEQ_02","At the appointed location, you rendezvous with Arenvald, who has succeeded in enlisting the aid of Alphinaud, Y'shtola, and Thancred. Deeming it best to have eyes both inside and outside the throne room, you proceed to divide your forces into two groups. Thancred and Y'shtola will keep watch without, while you and the others take up positions within. Make your way to the palace's rear entrance, on the eastern edge of the quarter, and identify yourself to the guard on duty."
3,"TEXT_STMBDB111_02972_SEQ_03","In the midst of the meeting, the Qalyana broodmother somehow summons forth an incarnation of Sri Lakshmi, plunging the throne room into chaos. Too late, you realize that the guards entrusted with keeping the area free of crystals have themselves been enthralled. As the only warriors present blessed with the protection of the Echo, you and Arenvald must occupy the primal whilst your companions defend the visiting envoys from the Qalyana and the enthralled guards. Rally the hesitant Arenvald, and make your stand against the Lady of Bliss!

※In the event that you leave the palace, speak with the Resistance guard in the Ala Mhigan Quarter to re-enter the throne room."

Swallowing your questions, you engage Sri Lakshmi together, and succeed at last in banishing her to the aether. The battle is over, but the Butcher still stands before you, free of her fetters, weapon in hand..."
5,"TEXT_STMBDB111_02972_SEQ_05","After a taut moment, Fordola surrenders her sword, and returns to her cell of her own accord. It would seem the danger has passed. Ask Lyse if she and her guests are unharmed."

No longer needed, you retire to the rooftop gardens, where you are joined after a time by Raubahn. The General tells you of the council's decision to form an elected government, signaling the end of his time in Ala Mhigo.

7,"TEXT_STMBDB111_02972_SEQ_07","As you and your companions discuss the day's events, Nanamo arrives, flanked by Pipin and a rather sheepish-looking Raubahn. After some prompting by the sultana, the gruff warrior duly announces that he has been dismissed as leader of the Immortal Flames, and stripped of his seat on the Syndicate. Shocking though these revelations are, it does not take long for the assembled company to make light of them─and small wonder, for Ala Mhigo's dearest son is finally home. Speak with Lyse, and learn of her plans for the future."
8,"TEXT_STMBDB111_02972_SEQ_08","For the moment, it seems that Lyse intends to return to Rhalgr's Reach. Follow Alphinaud's lead, and join her at the Resistance stronghold."
