1,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_SEQ_01","Ser Alberic greets you by mentioning that he has finished gathering information on the Dravanian legends that appear relevant to your search. He hands you a piece of parchment detailing the first tale he suggests you investigate, taking care to mention that the Congregation priest emphasized these stories can rarely be taken at face value. You set off to relay this information to Heustienne and Orn Khai."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_SEQ_02","The legend Ser Alberic has dug up concerns the Slumbering Wyrm of Gyr Abania. Orn Khai is initially distracted upon seeing the parchment, as dragons do not have a written language; they pass down their history through song, which is how he knows the name of his father's consort: Faunehm. Heustienne asks you to accompany Orn Khai to the Fringes to learn more about the Slumbering Wyrm."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_SEQ_03","The impatient young dragon rushes into the temple without you, and judging by his cries for help, he regrets having done so."
4,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_SEQ_04","Orn Khai's assailant bested, you resume your search for the dragon of legend. Just as the youthful Dravanian is wondering whether or not the creature you encountered was the Slumbering Wyrm itself, a rather scholarly looking gentleman appears."
5,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_SEQ_05","The gentleman turns out to be one Professor Erik, and he too has an interest in the legend of the Slumbering Wyrm. He goes on to give you a lecture on the subject─the only noteworthy part of which being that the Slumbering Wyrm was actually a high priest, who passed away over three hundred years prior. Orn Khai soon grows tired of Erik's musings and suggests you head to Coerthas to speak with Ser Alberic. "
6,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_SEQ_06","Ser Alberic apologizes for sending you on a wild goose chase of sorts, but is quick to note that he has another legend you may wish to explore. This one's roots lie far to the east, Ser Alberic remarking that Orn Khai may struggle to make the journey with you due to his modestly sized wings. Orn Khai is, however, undeterred and convinces Ser Alberic to come up with a way to allow him to make the crossing to Kugane.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Ser Alberic upon reaching level 65."

51,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ALBERIC_000_021","However, the priest bade me make it clear to you that these kinds of legends are oft told in increasingly...<Emphasis>colorful</Emphasis> ways as the years go on."
52,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ALBERIC_000_022","Quite common it is for a mere scalekin or puk to, with the Keeper's help, transform into a fearsome dragon. I suppose it should come as little surprise. Legends gain fame by capturing the imagination of the masses; it would not do for an unadorned winged lizard to be the protagonist."
53,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ALBERIC_000_023","But let us put the issue of authenticity to one side for a moment. I have summarized the first tale which seemed most relevant on this piece of parchment; pray put it to use in your search. Oh, and lastly, tell Heustienne that she is ever in my thoughts."
54,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ALBERIC_000_025","Never before have I looked into Dravanian legends with any purpose other than hunting a dragon in mind. Mayhap this is a glimpse of the dragoon's future role in this realm."
55,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_HEUSTIENNE_000_030","Would that parchment happen to be for mine eyes?"
56,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_HEUSTIENNE_000_031","Ah yes, I would never forget Ser Alberic's exquisite handwriting. This information shall be of great use, I am sure. Let us see, it seems he thinks we ought to commence our search with the Slumbering Wyrm of Gyr Abania."
57,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ORNKHAI_000_032","This is my first time seeing these patterns that men use. Fascinating indeed that you can share information in such a manner."
58,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ORNKHAI_000_033","Dravanian history is chronicled not with letters, but through song. These verses have taught me much about Faunehm─my father's consort."

73,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ERIK_000_074","Hahahaha! You Dravanians could do with studying up on your history. The time when one could meet the Wyrm has long since passed!"
74,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ERIK_000_075","The high priest Heimart, also known as the Slumbering Wyrm, departed this world over three hundred years ago!"

76,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ERIK_000_077","But of course! Why would you think otherwise? Heimart was a monk renowned for his mastery of meditation. Though, when necessary, he was quite capable of harnessing his wyrm-like strength to trounce his foes."

82,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ALBERIC_000_102","A port city called Kugane? Sounds positively fascinating. I imagine 'twould be a fine place to begin looking into this next legend. Regrettably, I should not think Orn Khai will be able to accompany you on this journey."
83,"TEXT_JOBDRG630_02911_ALBERIC_000_103","Truly, you have never made the journey? You are so well traveled I assumed you must have visited the city.
