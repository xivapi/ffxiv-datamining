49,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_010","All jesting aside, we must tell people the good news. And I think Lyse should be the first."
50,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ALPHINAUD_000_011","Seconded. She is bound to be delighted."
51,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_JMOLDVA_000_012","If I am no longer needed, then I shall take my leave."
52,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_013","Of course, don't let us keep you. Thanks again, and say hello to V'mah for me."
53,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ALPHINAUD_000_014","Now then, there is to be a meeting of representatives from across Ala Mhigo, so Lyse is sure to be in the city. Shall we seek her out?"
54,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_020","Oh? You three look pleased with yourselves. What've you been up to?"
55,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_021","I'm glad you asked, Lyse. And I'm pretty sure you're going to like the answer..."

59,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ALPHINAUD_000_025","Arenvald did not exaggerate, I assure you. We could not hope to carry even a fraction of it out on our own. I have taken the liberty of sketching out a rough map of the ruins─if you will assemble a squad of your most trusted freedom fighters, they should be able to follow the route to where the treasure lies."
60,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_026","Understood. I'll make sure every coin is accounted for, and that goes for the spending of it as well!"

62,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_028","Oh, there is one other thing: when the time comes to draw up a plan for distributing the spoils, I would ask that you consult Alphinaud."

64,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_030","Oh, I know the feeling! I'd welcome any advice you could give us, Alphinaud."
65,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ALPHINAUD_000_031","Of course. I shall be at your disposal."

75,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_RAUBAHN_000_061","'Tis a difficult tide to stem. 'Twas that same rage which brought us to our feet, and carried us to victory. But now the war is over, all the unspent fury is being channeled into vengeance."
76,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_MNAAGO_000_062","Aye, and it's not just here─we've reports of mobs forming all over."
77,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_MNAAGO_000_063","They've been targeting folk known to have cooperated with the Garleans. It starts with insults most often, then someone picks up a stone..."

79,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_065","I want to build a country where everyone, regardless of race or origin, can live side by side in peace. But maybe the time isn't right. Maybe people just aren't ready..."
80,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_066","But that doesn't mean I'm not going to try. The representatives will be here soon, and I'll be damned if I'm going to give up before I've even begun."

82,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_068","Oh, village elders, refugee leaders and the like. It wouldn't be right for us to dictate the nation's future on our own, so we've planned a summit of sorts."
83,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_069","We've even invited the Ananta and the Qiqirn to participate."

85,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_MNAAGO_000_071","Then let's execute her and be done with it. She herself asked to be put to death."
86,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_072","Naago! I already explained why we wouldn't do that!"
87,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_073","Sending her to the gallows might satisfy people right now, but where would it end? Should we round up everyone who collaborated? And everyone who didn't resist? There would be no one left! And we'd be no better than Theodoric and Zenos!"
88,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_074","Begging your pardon, but...might I be allowed to speak with Fordola? Only, I caught a glimpse of her past. A moment of it, anyway─during the fight."
89,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_075","She's done terrible things, aye...unforgivable things... But...in some ways, she's a victim of the circumstances in which she was born. And that's something I can understand..."
90,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_076","All right. Speak with the prison guard when you're ready, and I'll come and join you. I want to talk to her too."
91,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_RAUBAHN_000_077","I'll return to my other duties, then─we've barely begun to investigate the facility where they gave Fordola her powers. Be fairly warned, friends: she will test you. Don't let your emotions color your judgment when she does."
92,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ALPHINAUD_000_080","If you will have me, I have a mind to attend this interview as well."
