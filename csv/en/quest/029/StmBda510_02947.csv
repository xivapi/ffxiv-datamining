56,"TEXT_STMBDA510_02947_TSURANUKI_000_012","Yes, yes, plates of steel, all that you can carry. The better to shield them from blade and bullet!"
57,"TEXT_STMBDA510_02947_ISSE_000_013","If only it were so simple, Master Tsuranuki. Steel plates are not so easily procured─"
58,"TEXT_STMBDA510_02947_TSURANUKI_000_014","Blind, deaf, and dumb you are, boy! We are awash in broken steel. Magitek, great cylinders come crashing to the earth from on high!"

69,"TEXT_STMBDA510_02947_TSURANUKI_000_045","Every shred of pride and honor he cast aside, without a second thought! All to win their trust. All to serve as their puppet. Restored to his throne years later, a paper tiger."
70,"TEXT_STMBDA510_02947_TSURANUKI_000_046","Such shame he must have felt, but no matter! He would suffer it for his people. A life as slaves is better than none at all, he believed. But not us."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA510_02947_TSURANUKI_000_047","After my lady died, we began to whisper in his ears dreams of freedom and liberation. We pushed him to take action, if only a little..."
