51,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TATARU_000_012","Cid regrets that he couldn't come here in person. Apparently his hunt for the dragon and Omega demands his full attention, you see..."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TATARU_000_013","Still, he was reasonably confident that the documents he provided would be enough for Alphinaud to do the work himself. So as soon as that parcel gets here, we can open it up and see what's inside!"

54,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TATARU_000_015","I believe so, yes. Why do you ask?"
55,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_HANCOCK_000_016","Well, you see, on closer inspection, said parcel appears to have been addressed to the Sekiseigumi Barracks."
56,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_HANCOCK_000_017","Though it does indeed bulge with a quantity of paper reminiscent of a rather large instruction manual, the lingering scent of lilac leads me to conclude it is in fact a sizable collection of love letters..."
57,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TATARU_000_018","What!? Impossible! That porter was carrying a parcel addressed to us! I saw the writing with my own eyes!"
58,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_HANCOCK_000_019","Oh, I do not doubt that in the least. However, as he was tasked with a number of deliveries, I can only presume that he handed you another parcel by mistake."

60,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_HANCOCK_000_021","My, she can move quickly when she has a mind to do so. So quickly she neglected to take these love letters with her. They too must be redirected to their rightful recipient."

62,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_HANCOCK_000_023","The man in question was of middling height and build. Not unlike myself. Black hair, short─terribly helpful in Kugane, I know. A cheery sort. Wearing bright colors, as I recall?"
63,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_HANCOCK_000_024","I will send a few of my men out to search, but in the meantime, why don't you take the parcel and see if you can't track him down yourself? I will wait here, on the off chance he realizes his mistake and returns."
64,"TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_HANCOCK_000_030","Short, black hair, light-colored garments. In all other respects, not unlike myself. But then, I am so terribly unremarkable, am I not?"
