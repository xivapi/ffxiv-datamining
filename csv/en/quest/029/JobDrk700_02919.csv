1,"TEXT_JOBDRK700_02919_SEQ_01","Sid has at last accepted that Myste is not coming back to Ishgard, and that if we are to reclaim the remainder of our stolen aether, we will need to take the initiative. Rhalgr's Reach was the last place you spoke, and so that is where we will go."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRK700_02919_SEQ_02","In speaking with the people of Rhalgr's Reach, we learn that Myste stayed there for a time, asking questions of a conjurer regarding aether and perhaps being responsible for the mysterious deaths of several chocobos. He's been naughty, to say the least."

As we drew closer the gates faded into vision, and the towering spires...the man bowed low and bade us follow him, up the winding stair, from still smoldering ruin to untouched splendor.
