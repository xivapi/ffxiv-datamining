49,"TEXT_STMBDY102_02920_ULGERIRONHEART_000_001","Hah, what are the odds! Millith is my niece, lest you wonder, and she has told me much and more about you in her letters."
50,"TEXT_STMBDY102_02920_ULGERIRONHEART_000_002","Ah, but where are my manners? Ulger Ironheart, at your service. I'm an explorer like most of the clan, and my niece bade me share with you such knowledge I have accumulated. Here, lend me your log."

58,"TEXT_STMBDY102_02920_ULGERIRONHEART_000_020","In my capacity as an explorer, I must inform you that the lands beyond are fraught with danger. If you mean to venture forth, you'd best have the means to protect yourself."
