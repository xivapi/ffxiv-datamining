48,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_ZUKIN_000_000","Mother of pearl is used in many of our crafts, as you may have seen. The rarely seen diamond oyster is a prime source, and a whole host of them have suddenly appeared on the Isle of Bekko."
49,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_ZUKIN_000_001","One of our craftsmen has gone to open up the shells and gather the contents on-site. However, diamond oysters are notoriously hard to open, so perhaps he would benefit from an extra pair of hands?"
50,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_010","Oh! I've seen you before! You are a friend of the Divine Circle, yes? And now you are here to help me? Must be my lucky day."
51,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_011","I'm after the mother of pearl inside those oysters, but the damned things won't open! Hard as diamonds they are! They certainly live up to their name. I've tried prising them apart, dropping rocks on them, but no joy. "
52,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_012","The only thing I haven't tried is explosives. A bit of gentle persuasion, and they should pop right open! I hate to admit it, but I'm scared I might do myself a mischief. I don't suppose you could give it a try?"
53,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_013","Once a bomb is set to blow, remember to give it a wide berth! We don't want bits of adventurer being blasted all over the place, do we now?"
54,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_015","I will be standing here supervising, well out of harm's way. All right then, off you go!"
55,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_020","Nicely done! The oysters are a bit more “obliterated” than I would've liked, but fragments of mother of pearl are better than nothing at all. Many thanks!"
56,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_025","Gathering all those bits of shell is rather a daunting task. I'm just trying to motivate myself to actually get started."
57,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_ZUKIN_000_030","All finished? ...Explosives, you say? I am no expert in mother of pearl, but I do not imagine it takes well to being blown up like that. However, I will defer to our artisan friend on this occasion."
58,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_ZUKIN_000_031","His works sell very well in Kugane, you know. If he finds a way to increase production, there might be enough to sell to markets farther afield too. Once more, you have my gratitude."
