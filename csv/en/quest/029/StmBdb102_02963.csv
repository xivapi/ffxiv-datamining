75,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ERNOLD_000_063","Those were terrible enough. But in his last days, the king's fevered mind settled upon an even grislier method of “disposal” which only a chosen few were unfortunate enough to witness."

80,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_080","Since we're all here, why don't we share what we've learned?"
81,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ALPHINAUD_000_081","Allow me to begin, then. As promised, I scoured the imperial records for any mention of fantastic treasures...and found precisely none."
82,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ALPHINAUD_000_082","It is just possible, I suppose, that a corrupt official deliberately hid the fact of the trove's discovery, hoping to enrich himself─but I find it rather unlikely that so valuable a find would stay secret for long. I conclude that our prize either does not exist, or that the imperials somehow overlooked it."
83,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ALPHINAUD_100_082","But what of you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Were your investigations any more fruitful?"

91,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_088","If he was afraid, that does lend credence to the tale─though I'm not sure how that helps us in our search."

93,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ALPHINAUD_000_090","Do not be so hasty─Ernold's anecdote may very well have told us where the trove is hidden. But ere I share my theory, there is a matter I would clarify."
94,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ALPHINAUD_000_091","Arenvald, you spoke of light-hearted adventure, but I sense a deeper motive for this expedition. Why are you so intent on finding this treasure?"

96,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_093","My father was in the imperial army, a man of Garlean blood. I trust you know what I mean when I say that my Ala Mhigan mother did not welcome my arrival?"
97,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_094","As I grew, she would check my brow over and over, convinced that a spot on my skin was an emerging third eye─like the kind you see in pureblood Garleans. My mother did not care for this taunting reminder of my heritage, and took up a knife...
War paint serves to cover the scar."
98,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_095","In the end, she turned me out into the street, and I was left to haunt the alleyways of Ala Mhigo, a feral child who got what he needed through begging, cunning, or worse."
99,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_096","The best I can say about the years that followed is that I survived. But I hated the animal I'd become. Eventually, I left the city behind me, and joined a group of refugees bound for the other side of the Wall. It was then that I turned to adventuring, and that road led me into the company of the Scions."
100,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_097","I tell you this so that you understand: I know all too well what poverty and hunger can do to a person."
101,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ARENVALD_000_098","I drew steel on ordinary folk for a measly crust of bread. With Theodoric's gold, I could spare my countrymen the shame of living like that."
102,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ALPHINAUD_000_099","Thank you, Arenvald, and I apologize─that cannot have been pleasant to recall. But I felt it best to be clear in our intentions."
103,"TEXT_STMBDB102_02963_ALPHINAUD_000_100","Well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Are you content to surrender the treasure to Arenvald's noble cause, and claim the thrill of adventure as your reward?"
