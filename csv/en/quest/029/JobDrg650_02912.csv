1,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_01","Ser Alberic reports that he has succeeded in finding a way to have Orn Khai transported across to Kugane. He neglects to inform you of exactly how the young dragon will be making the journey, but ensures you that you will be able to rendezvous with him if you speak to Karaku, the owner of the Bokaisen Hot Springs."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_02","Upon hearing your name, Karaku hastily rushes off to collect a package he says is addressed to you. It is immediately evident that all is not as it seems when the contents of the crate start demanding to be set free. Orn Khai soon escapes from the confines of the box and informs you that the legend of the Serpent of the Ruby Sea is the tale you shall be investigating next. The two of you make your way to Isari in order to see just how much the locals know."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_03","A local fisherman tells you that he is familiar with a faerie tale that mentions the Serpent of the Ruby Sea. However, as his knowledge does not stretch much beyond that, he bids you talk to one of the village's older inhabitants if you seek more information. You spy an elderly woman nearby and head in her direction to see if she cannot aid your search."
4,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_04","As luck would have it, the elderly lady is well versed in matters concerning the legend. According to her, the serpent is no mere faerie tale; it lurks nearby the Coral Banquet and has been to known to eat men whole. Undeterred, you elect to summon Orn Khai in order to share with him your findings."
5,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_05","After hearing that the serpent commonly eats pirates whole, Orn Khai suggests there is little chance that the creature could be Faunehm. Nonetheless, his curiosity gets the better of him and he requests your assistance in searching for the beast of legend. Orn Khai heads off to hunt the bait required to lure the creature out of hiding, while you head for the Coral Banquet."
6,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_06","Orn Khai hurls the freshly hunted bait into the sea and, lo and behold, a menacing creature rises from the ocean depths. You lock horns with the Serpent of the Ruby Sea."
7,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_07","After a fierce battle you finally succeed in slaying the legendary serpent. Inspired by the creature's size, Orn Khai decides to take its carcass back to Bokaisen Hot Springs for supper."
8,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_SEQ_08","Upon your return to Bokaisen Hot Springs, Orn Khai greets you with the disheartening news that he has already helped himself to the choice cuts of serpent meat. Putting the issue to one side, it is agreed that Orn Khai will remain in Kugane and search for further leads as to Faunehm's whereabouts.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Orn Khai upon reaching level 68."

61,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_028","Before I was unceremoniously stuffed into that crate, Ser Alberic told me of the legend of Seiryu─a dragon regarded as a guardian of the Far East."
62,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_029","Though something tells me we would not have much luck with this tale either. The story has existed for several thousand years; Faunehm only came to these lands a mere millennium ago."
63,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_030","Ser Alberic agreed that the story most worth our attention was that of the Serpent of the Ruby Sea. This came into being much more recently."
64,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_031","I suggest you visit Isari and try asking the residents if they know anything that might be of help. Whistle for me once you feel you have found something I should know."

67,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ISARIFISHER_000_041","You will struggle to find someone here that is not! Not a day of my childhood passed without my grandmother telling me that faerie tale. These days, hearing the opening line of it alone puts me to sleep in an instant."

75,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_061","Hmm, while it is true we dragons do hunt by following our prey's scent, I have not known our kind to swallow men whole. The idea strikes me as awfully...barbaric."
76,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_062","While I doubt this will lead us to Faunehm, my curiosity has been piqued and I cannot simply leave this mystery unsolved!"
77,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_063","It is also a brilliant excuse for me to engage in a bit of hunting! We cannot hope to draw out the beast without bait after all. Head to the Coral Banquet and I shall join you shortly."
78,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_070","Father never mentioned you were this slow, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I have already hunted a beast that will doubtless lure out the serpent and I still arrived here long before you."
79,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_071","I shall go ahead and hurl the bloody meat into the sea. Pray deal with any hungry creatures that are drawn to us."

84,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_101","Please do help yourself to whatever is left; I have stored the scra─leftovers in the crate I was sent here in. Pay no attention to anything that may resemble teeth marks, those are indentations created by the ice!"
85,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_102","Oh, anyone could see through that lie. I am sorry, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I do hope my greed has not upset you too much."

90,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_105","Truly? After hearing of your feats of strength from Ser Alberic, I assumed you must feast upon tonzes of meat everyday!"
91,"TEXT_JOBDRG650_02912_ORNKHAI_000_106","Regardless, meat is far from our primary concern at the moment. I am beginning to wonder if the day we find Faunehm will ever come."
