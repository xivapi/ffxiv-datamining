49,"TEXT_STMBDY105_02936_ESTRILD_000_002","Just a moment... You are a newly made member of Clan Centurio, are you not? <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, was it?"
50,"TEXT_STMBDY105_02936_ESTRILD_000_003","Aye, I knew it! I've heard your name from good Ardolain. To hear him tell it, you're quite the hunter."

Mayhap you've made an ill name for yourself. No reverence for authority? Trouble getting on with others? No matter. The Hunt will solve all your worries and woes. Kill your quarry and redeem your reputation!"
52,"TEXT_STMBDY105_02936_ESTRILD_000_005","There is no need for fanciful or flowery explanations. Simply hunt, hunt, hunt, and hunt some more! The more monsters that die by your hand, the more the Clan will hold you in high esteem. Heed the call, and prove yourself!"
53,"TEXT_STMBDY105_02936_ESTRILD_000_006","Ahhh, just talking of the Hunt sets my blood to surging! No doubt you care to know more, for how could you not? Go and see Wlveva outside the Shiokaze Hostelry. She will tell you all you need to know. Off with you, then!"
54,"TEXT_STMBDY105_02936_WLVEVA_000_010","Estrild sent you, did she? So, you are the one of our Clan named <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."

57,"TEXT_STMBDY105_02936_WLVEVA_000_013","Oh, I'm in the wrong, am I? Well, this much I know to be right─for a savage such as yourself to languish in our lowest ranks is a waste not often seen in Clan Centurio."
