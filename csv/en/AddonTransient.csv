187,"**Learn Your Structures**
**Arcana Stones**
  You and your opponent each have three of these immobile crystals on
  the playing field. Shatter all of your enemy's Arcana Stones to claim
  victory.
**Gates**
  Minions will appear in front of your currently selected gate.
  Returning minions to a gate area will restore their HP.
  Minions can still be summoned from a destroyed gate, but they will be
  unable to exit the gate area. Conversely, minions outside a destroyed
  gate will be unable to enter.
**Search Eye**
  This structure reveals your opponent's minions. If the Search Eye is
  destroyed, you will only be able to see enemy units that are near
  your own minions.
**Shield**
  This structure adds defensive strength to Arcana Stones. Destroy the
  enemy Shield and your opponent's Arcana Stones will be more easily
  shattered.

**Structural Regeneration**
  All structures except for Arcana Stones can only be temporarily
  destroyed. Their various functions will reactivate at full strength
  after a certain amount of time has passed.
  ※Positioning your minions near a destroyed structure will hasten
  　the reactivation process.

**Play to Your Minions' Strengths**
  Each variety of minion is capable of inflicting greater damage against
  certain structures. Learn each unit's strengths, and pick the right
  minion for the job!

**Turn the Tide with Special Actions**
  These conditions must be met before a special action can be used:
  ・Four minions of the same variety are gathered in an action party
  ・Each minion in the action party has full action points
   (Action points accumulate over time)
  To perform a special action, select an individual minion from the
  action party, and press the Execute Action button on the minion
  hotbar.

**Mastering Traps**
  Some minions will place traps with their special actions. A trap will
  become armed ten seconds after it has been placed, and it can then
  be triggered by pressing the Trigger Trap button on the minion
  hotbar.
  ※Only one trap can be placed at a time.

**※When challenging a duty with NPCs, coffers will contain fewer items. In addition, some enemies will no longer drop rewards.**"
416,Duty Support
417,"By choosing **Duty Support** under **Duty** in the main menu, or by accessing the entrance of any applicable duty, you can summon a **team of NPC allies** to assist you. NPC parties will be **automatically balanced** to suit your current class or job. Once you have made your preparations, select **Register for Duty**, and ready yourself for battle!"
418,Commencing Duty
419,"Once you have registered and your duty is available, a prompt window indicated by a **notification sound** will appear. Begin duty by selecting **Commence**.

**※Please note that if you do not commence duty within the time limit, your registration will be automatically withdrawn, and you must start the process over.**"
420,What Next?
421,"Over the course of your adventures, the number of duties available to you will gradually increase. Should you encounter a duty for which NPC support is not available, access the **Duty Finder** to team up with other players instead. You may also rechallenge previously cleared duties by using either the **Duty Finder** or **Duty Support**, both accessible via **Duty** in the main menu."

1003,Fellowships
1004,"Fellowships are gatherings of players who share common interests. With up to 1,000 members permitted in each fellowship, they provide an excellent way to connect and socialize with like-minded adventurers.

Anyone can create their own fellowship or become a member of another. Fellowships are cross-world, and you can belong to a maximum of ten at any given time.

To search for fellowships that are currently recruiting, select **Social** from the **main menu**, and then **Fellowship Finder**.

Each fellowship is led by a master, who can grant administrative rights to other members to assist them. The master role automatically falls to the fellowship's founder, but it can also be transferred to another.

Join a fellowship or create your own, and gain access to its myriad benefits!"

1009,Members Tab

1017,Ensemble Mode
1018,"**■Overview
Ensemble mode makes it easier for you and your party members to play in sync for the benefit of your audience.

**■Playback Differences between Performance and Ensemble Mode
When ensemble mode is enabled, all party members will be heard in sync by players in the vicinity, but there will be a delay between the inputs and the sounds being heard by those performing, according to the playback type.
Those who select “Self Only” will only hear their own instrument, while “All Members” plays the instruments of all members with an increased delay.
※“Playback Type” can be found in ensemble mode's settings menu.

**■Entering Ensemble Mode
Follow the steps below to enter ensemble mode.
 1. Select “Ensemble Ready Check” from the metronome menu.
 2. With “Enter Ensemble Mode” enabled, select Begin.

1021,"**The rules of engagement on the Bozjan southern front are different than what you will have encountered before. The following pages contain a detailed explanation of what you may expect on the battlefield.**

**Read and understand them well if you would gain the upper hand over the Empire's IVth Legion."
1022,"**■Level Sync**

Though it is possible to join the Bozjan southern front beginning at level 71, all players will be synced to level 80 while in duty. Item level will also be synced accordingly.

*** All job actions unlocked through level 80 will also be available while in duty."
1023,"**■Resistance Rank**

All players are subject to a separate leveling system while at the front, indicated by their “Resistance rank.” Performing admirably in large-scale battles such as skirmishes and critical engagements will increase your “mettle”─akin to experience points.

*** Simply defeating imperial troops and beasts is not enough to prove your mettle─you must participate in successful military operations."
1024,"If you demonstrate sufficient mettle upon reporting to the Resistance commander, your Resistance rank will climb. Those of higher rank will gain access to more areas of the front, as well as additional quests.

*** Your Resistance rank will not increase unless authorized by the commander, so don't forget to report for inspection!"
1025,"**■Job Leveling**

Upon successful completion of a military operation, you will gain regular experience points in addition to mettle. This experience will be applied to your job level as normal, so it is recommended that you consider using a job that has not yet reached level 80 to take advantage of experience point gains."
1026,"**■But Wait...**

More information is available from Sjeros in Gangos and your Resistance comrades at the southern front, so don't hesitate to converse with them!"
1027,Collectables
1028,"The higher an item's collectability, the more attractive it is to certain NPCs who are seeking to purchase or trade for them. It should be noted, however, these items must meet a certain collectability threshold before they will be accepted by NPCs."
1029,The Collectables Interface
1030,Selecting a collectable item in the gathering window will open the collectables interface. Here you can try to improve the item's collectability rating before adding it to your inventory.
1031,Increasing Collectability
1032,"Techniques such as **Scour** can be employed to increase the collectability of an item. It should be noted, however, the gathering point's **integrity** is diminished by the use of such actions. Integrity is also reduced when gathering items. One must be mindful of their actions to ensure integrity still remains after reaching a suitable collectability rating."
1033,Collectable Actions
1034,"There are three key actions used to raise collectability, each of which reduces the gathering point's integrity by one.

Scour
Increases collectability by a fixed amount determined by your gathering rating.

Brazen Prospector / Brazen Woodsman
Increases collectability by a random amount that may be lower or significantly higher than Scour. A potentially efficient option when gathering in a location where your desired item can be found in abundance.

Meticulous Prospector / Meticulous Woodsman
Increases collectability by a fixed amount lower than Scour. However, there is chance integrity is unaffected. A good option when you're certain your next action will reach the desired collectability rating."
1035,Gathering Collectables
1036,"When the item reaches a sufficient collectability rating, use the **Collect** action to gather the item and add it to your inventory. Be mindful, however, that the integrity of the gathering spot is reduced by one for every item gathered. When its integrity reaches zero, no more items can be gathered.

※You may fail to gather an item if its gathering rate is not 100%."
1037,Improving Collectability
1038,"The effectiveness of collectable actions such as Scour can be enhanced further by first using **Scrutiny**. While this action does not affect the gathering point's integrity, it does cost GP. A higher perception rating will increase the potency of this action."
1039,Collector's Intuition
1040,"When using collectable actions, there is a chance to trigger **Collector's Intuition**, granting a bonus to collectability. The chance of triggering this bonus increases with a higher perception rating.

※You may also increase the chance of triggering this bonus by using Collector's Focus."
1041,Collector's Standard
1042,"When using collectable actions, there is a chance you will be granted the effect of **Collector's Standard**. While under this effect, the potency of brazen and meticulous actions is increased significantly."
1043,Other Actions
1044,"Raising collectability should not be your only focus when gathering collectables. Actions that increase gathering rate, as well as those that grant additional gathering attempts or restore integrity, are also essential to procure as many collectables as possible. Careful planning and effective use of all actions is the key to success for accomplished Disciples of the Land."
1045,Prime and Sublime Collectables
1046,"Prime collectable items that have reached maximum collectability will, on occasion, yield exceedingly rare items from aetherial reduction.

Moreover, these prime collectables may also become sublime when they are gathered with maximum collectability, which guarantees a yield of rare items from aetherial reduction.

A higher gathering rate increases your chances of a prime collectable becoming sublime."
1047,Collectability
1048,"The collectability of an item is another means of measuring its intrinsic quality.

Collectability required to deliver an item can be confirmed at the top right of the interface.

When breaking down items via aetherial reduction, this rating indicates the collectability required to obtain items other than crystals."
1049,
1050,Entering V&C Dungeons
1051,"You can enter a variant or criterion dungeon via the V&C Dungeon Finder window, which is accessed by speaking with the NPC at the dungeon entrance, or by selecting the option from **Duty** in the main menu.

This window features all the necessary information regarding dungeon entry, as well as the dungeon-specific settings."
1052,Variant Dungeons
1053,"The difficulty of a **variant dungeon** is automatically adjusted to provide a challenge for parties of between one to four players. Victory will require effort and attention, but it is entirely possible to complete these dungeons alone. 

If you wish to enter as a solo player or with your current party members, be sure to uncheck the **Enable party matching** option (disabled by default). Conversely, enabling this option will match you with other adventurers to tackle the dungeon in a four-player party."
1054,Variant Actions
1055,"To allow for greater freedom in role choices, variant dungeons grant players the use of special **variant actions**.

These actions mimic existing abilities such as **Cure** or **Rampart**, alleviating the need for dedicated tanks, DPS, or healers. Each player has two actions available for use during the dungeon, and these can be changed **at any time** via the **Set Actions** button in the V&C Dungeon Finder window."
1056,Unraveling the Story
1057,"Variant dungeons feature **branching paths**, and by exploring these choices alongside the quest character will you reveal new elements of the overarching story.

Upon completing each path, a new entry will be added to the journal or expedition log associated with the dungeon. Simply open the V&C Dungeon Finder window and select the character portrait to browse the completed entries."
1058,Criterion Dungeons
1059,"You have unlocked **criterion dungeons**, a tier of higher difficulties which can be accessed by switching the tab at the top of the V&C Dungeon Finder window. 

Criterion dungeons have no accompanying NPC or branching paths to explore. In place of newly discovered story elements, the tab will instead display a list of available dungeons, as well as the amount of **special currency** earned from completing these more punishing challenges."
1060,Criterion Dungeon Restrictions
1061,"Unlike variant dungeons, criterion dungeons **do not allow job changes**. Resurrection via Raise or other abilities is also restricted, being permitted only through use of the special action Variant Raise II.

Criterion dungeons of **Savage** difficulty disable the use of variant actions completely, and must be attempted by preformed four-player parties meeting the entry requirements."
1062,Estate Holder Rights
1063,"Rightsholders can eject specific players from their estate hall or garden and bar them from entering their property for a set period of time.

From the Social menu, select “Housing,” followed by “Estate Settings” and lastly “Estate Holder Rights” to adjust the relevant settings."
1064,Rightsholders
1065,"Only characters designated as Rightsholders can utilize the relevant features. The Main Rightsholder is determined automatically based on the type of estate. In some cases, Secondary Rightsholders can also be appointed.

In the case of free company estates, the company master is designated as the Main Rightsholder, and can appoint shared estate members as Secondary Rightsholders.

Apartments and private chambers can only have a Main Rightsholder."
1066,Barred Characters
1067,"Characters who have been barred from entering your property are shown on the Barred Characters list. Both Main and Secondary Rightsholders can access the list by selecting “Barred Characters” from the Estate Holder Rights window.

To bar a character from your property, you must first be present on your estate and have the requisite authority. Target the character you wish to bar and select “Bar from Property” from the subcommands, then choose “Register as Barred Character.”

Barred characters will remain on the Barred Characters list for 10 days. During this time they are prevented from entering your estate hall or garden.

Main Rightsholders can remove characters from the list as they see fit."
1068,Blacklist Referencing
1069,"Blacklist referencing is a feature that automatically bars characters on a rightsholder's blacklist from entering a property. When a Main Rightsholder or Secondary Rightsholder with the setting enabled is present on an estate, characters on their blacklist will be denied access to the property, and will be automatically registered to the Barred Characters list should they attempt to enter.

This setting can be toggled on or off using the checkbox displayed to the left of a character's name under “Rightsholder Settings.”"
1070,Exceptions
1071,"Depending on the type of estate, you may be unable to bar certain characters from entering your property. Even when registered to your Barred Characters list, exempt characters will not be ejected from your property, nor denied access.

The following characters cannot be barred:
・The Main Rightsholder
・Free company estate members
・Tenants in shared personal housing
"
1072,Interior Design
1073,"Renovate an estate's interior with the interior design feature.

From the Social menu, select “Housing,” followed by “Interior Design” to open the relevant window, from which you may select the desired interior style.

Once applied, everything inside of the estate aside from the wallpaper, flooring, and ceiling lights will be changed. Please note that the floor layout, including the position of the stairs, may also be altered."
1074,Requirements
1075,"The interior design of cottages, houses, and mansions can be changed.

To accommodate a newly applied interior style, all placed furnishings will be moved to the storeroom. The interior design process cannot be completed should the storeroom possess insufficient space.

Additionally, interior design adjustments cannot be made within fifteen days of estate auto-demolition.

**※The interior design of apartments and private chambers cannot be changed.**"
1076,Authorization
1077,"Adjustment of an estate's interior design can only be performed by those granted the necessary authorization.

Free Company estates: Members who have been granted both hall remodeling and furnishing placement authorization may change the estate's interior design.

Private estates: In addition to the owners, tenants with authorization to add, remove, or change the position/color of estate furnishings or walls may change the estate's interior design."
