29,"Were the tablet a fragment of holy scripture, 'twould most assuredly rest here on this altar. Yet this would, I presume, also have been where the Blessed placed the Font of Seeing used in the practice of their faith... Whither, then, would they have set the tablet?",,,18,61,1

41,Is that water I hear from inside that great big tube?,It must be because of those cogs and that gigantic wheel at the top.,"Oh, I see! That's how they draw up the water! There's probably some sort of spiral-shaped mechanism inside it, too.",20,61,1
42,That looks like the “trees” in Greatest Endsvale!,"Hold on, that's a bit of a strange shape... It's thin at the bottom but big and round at the top. Quite tall for something so unbalanced, too.",Now it makes sense! That's where they store the water!,20,61,1

We Sharlayans have, after all, always devoted ourselves to the pursuit of knowledge.",23,61,1
47,"Mythology tells us that Thaliak bore a magicked pitcher, from which poured forth the waters of knowledge.","See how the water is drawn up from the canals and cascades endlessly into the sea? As well as recreating the divine ewer from the tale, it also symbolizes the wisdom which rises from our city and flows out into the world.","If you would like to learn more about the mechanism by which it works, the stonemasons who built it left records of their struggle in the archives of Noumenon. A rather challenging construction, by all accounts.",23,61,1
48,"If you've learned your history, you will know that the Sixth Umbral Era brought a catastrophic flood to the lands of Eorzea. Yet when all seemed lost, the Twelve Archons rose up and saved multitudes from a terrible fate.","Of those twelve, it was Archon Nyunkrepf who brought our ancestors here in his ark, and together they founded what was to become the great nation of Sharlayan.","The beach at the foot of Thaliak's statue is the very spot where those first Sharlayans made land.
