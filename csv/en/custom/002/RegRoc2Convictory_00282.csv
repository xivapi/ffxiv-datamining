7,"TEXT_REGROC2CONVICTORY_00282_CONVICTORYGUIDE_000_012","...That's most everyone's plan, at least. Alas, most find their way into a dragon's belly instead of a baron's good graces, but we don't let that deter us! Aye, we Convictors are a crazy breed, half in love with death, gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat chestnuts!"

13,"TEXT_REGROC2CONVICTORY_00282_CONVICTORYGUIDE_000_202","And it's a good thing, too, since most of us know of no other life than dragonslaying. Aye, we shall remain here huffing on chapped hands and honing our stabbers until the day Jantellot turns us all out into the snow!"
