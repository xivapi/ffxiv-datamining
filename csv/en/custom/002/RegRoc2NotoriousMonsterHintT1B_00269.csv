In their final forms, even their horns drop off, leaving them with a sleek shape perfectly suited for flight."
10,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTT1B_00269_EUSTACIA_000_011","It is one such elder wyvern that has been marked for death by a certain nobleman. It seems the beast has taken something of a fancy to the fellow's son─a pretty young thing I wouldn't mind gobbling up myself. Mayhap not in the same manner as the wyvern, though..."
11,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTT1B_00269_EUSTACIA_000_012","You should be able to spot this monster easily enough─its sleek, shining scales have earned it the name “Scitalis,” after a legendary dragon with similarly lustrous skin."

Could this be our chance to bring Saint Valeroyant's legend to a close?"
21,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTT1B_00269_EUSTACIA_000_050","It isn't only the dragons who have brought heretics into our midst, you know. Five hundred years ago, another heretical sect gained traction among the smallfolk of Ishgard."
22,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTT1B_00269_EUSTACIA_000_051","The heathens adopted the customs of the Near East, bathing themselves in perfumes brewed from strange flowers and forging idols from rare metals that they used in their bizarre and unholy rites."
