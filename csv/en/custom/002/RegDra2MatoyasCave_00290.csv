1,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_Q1_000_050","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_A1_000_051","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_A1_000_052","What kind of place is this?"
4,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_A1_000_053","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_070","I am Toro Roggo, a humble servant of Mistress Matoya, ribbit."
6,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_071","In Sharlayan, it is commonplace to make servants of animals and objects by imbuing them with intelligence."
7,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_072","By my mistress's grace, I was raised from a lowly toad to become a poroggo capable of speech and reasoning."
8,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_073","But be warned, ribbit, for not all poroggos you meet will be as civilized and refined as I am. The masterless creatures outside the cave, for instance, will attack passersby unprovoked. Left behind during the exodus, they have taken leave of their powers of discernment."
9,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_074","In addition to we poroggos, my mistress also has brooms for her servants. Together, we aid her in many and more ways, from her research to her daily needs. Indeed, there is no end to the tasks that want for doing, ribbit."
10,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_090","This cave is the hidden abode of Mistress Matoya, ribbit. None are aware of its existence save you and your companions."
11,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_091","When my mistress first made it her home, it wasn't the most inviting of places. For one, the floor was bestrewn with the bones of various creatures."
12,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_092","But through my mistress's magicks and the brooms' tireless sweeping, it eventually became the snug place you see now."
13,"TEXT_REGDRA2MATOYASCAVE_00290_TOROROGGO_000_093","The dampness remains, to be sure, but that happens to be how we poroggos like it. I hope you do not mind, ribbit!"
