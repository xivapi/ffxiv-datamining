10,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_012","Frankly, it's altogether too much work for one man. I could use someone intelligent and capable...perhaps my nephew, if he would stop gallivanting about and come back to the city."

With these changes have come some additional duties, one of which includes accompanying the headmistress to various public engagements."
19,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_058","Seeing as we are often away, we have turned over the management of day-to-day operations to the students. While initially I had my doubts, I must say it was an excellent decision on our part. Not only has it helped build the students' confidence, but has also taught them the importance of being open to new ideas."

Here you will find the sons and daughters of great houses studying side by side with those of more humble origins. All that is required is a recommendation provided by one of the clergy."
22,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_022","Our curriculum encompasses a diverse range of subjects, from the fundamentals of Ishgardian theology to the intricacies of canon law. We also offer more specialized instruction for those who wish to focus on medicinal or magical fields."
23,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_023","However, to ensure that seminarians are adequately prepared for these studies, they must first complete both the trivium and the quadrivium: rigorous courses comprised of grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astrology, and music."

26,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_062","At this point in time, it is difficult to say what changes will be made. At the very least, I should expect the trivium and the quadrivium to remain, but the administration is somewhat divided on other subjects."

31,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_073","At the urging of our students, we have even started offering public lectures, which cover our great nation's true history. I can say with confidence this is a new beginning for us."

34,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_082","Not only did he cause undue distress but he has tainted the mind of one of our most promising students. He is the one who exacerbated Lebrassoir's growing discontent, which he then used to achieve his own ends."
35,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_083","Furthermore, we recently received news that Saturnois attempted to escape from his holding room, wounding several guards in the process and adding to his crimes."

37,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_085","Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to any of this. It seems all we can do at this point is await the results of his trial."
38,"TEXT_REGROC2SAINTREYMANAUDSCHOOL_00279_BRUVAGNON_000_086","Should by some miracle his sentence be reduced, and he demonstrates his willingness to truly re-dedicate his life to the Fury, Theomocent and a few other seminarians have announced their intention to welcome Saturnois back to the scholasticate. It is a day I sincerely look forward to."
