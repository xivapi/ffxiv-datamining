1,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A1_000_2","What does an alchemist do?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_010","What do I do here? Well, I certainly don't stand around answering fanciful questions! ...But I can see you plan to pester me until I do."
6,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_011","I am Severian, and, by some twist of fate's unfathomable humor, I serve as guildmaster to this insufferable gathering of alchemists."
7,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_012","Were you expecting a joyous union of cooperation and camaraderie? Hmph. Most of these fellows began as bitter rivals, and few of them are eager to share the results of their research."
8,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_013","It seems the only thing we can agree on is punishing the detestable practice of peddling false potions. Ruins our collective reputation, you understand. It is quite a sight to see the apprehended criminal subjected to a veritable shower of experimental concoctions!"
9,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_020","To properly define the intricate and miraculous work of an alchemist would take days of lengthy explanation─an explanation that you would most likely fail to understand. The simple appellation of “potion brewer” given to us by the masses is, however, largely accurate."
10,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_021","Restorative salves, ability-enhancing elixirs, deadly toxins and poisons─these are all substances that can be created through our versatile and practical profession."
11,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_022","With the proper knowledge and process, even the most worthless-seeming materials can be combined to produce wondrous compounds. The applications of alchemy are nearly limitless!"
12,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_050","Ah, my faithful assistant. Have you come to share some wonderful discovery from the boundless realm of alchemical potential?"
13,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_060","Ah, my faithful assistant. Though the details have quite slipped my mind, I was told you were involved in some outrageous incident at the royal palace. Why waste your time on such frivolities, when you could be exploring the uncharted regions of advanced alchemy!?"
14,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_061","If any seek to interrupt your research, then you need merely douse the knave with the most suitable concoction at hand! Mwahaha! The practical application of results is at the heart of our discipline!"
15,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_065","Ah, my assistant. I trust you are applying the same diligence you showed in my service to your work in Revenant's Toll?"
16,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_066","Good, good. Wiltwaek himself is an unremarkable mind, but he has a habit of bringing the most fascinating problems to my attention. Devote yourself to this investigation, and you may well stumble upon new concepts."
17,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_070","I have heard the case in Revenant's Toll is closed. More importantly, it was my spectrolium that proved Waoud's guilt. I cannot say I am surprised─even barely tested, the fruit of my genius was bound to save the day."
18,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_071","Every problem presents an opportunity, my assistant. Those of us who seek to unveil the truth must understand why problems arise, as well as how to solve them."
19,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_080","Seven hells take that damnable receptionist! Is there no end to her rampant stupidity? Only one so daft as she could possibly see fit to waste my time with such meaningless and mundane chores. Me! The very incarnation of alchemical omniscience!"
20,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_081","Well, I do believe this to be one of rare instances I have something not entirely hateful to say about our dear fool receptionist. She tends to bore me with nothing but the most inane of tasks, but of late she has managed to pique my curiosity. A corpse that does not rot? The mere thought is enough to tickle every fancy I have."
21,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_082","Heartstrike... I have heard its name, and of its powers. For an age I have dismissed it is as the stuff of bedtime tales, so absurd it sounded. But to think that it truly exists... Remarkable. Simply remarkable. "
22,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_083","And so now we know the true power of the blade what was known as Heartstrike. In its weakened state, it served only to keep death at bay, not grant life anew. In that, it was nothing more than the dark fixation of those with morbid minds. So it was, and so be it."
23,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_084","We have all lost those who were dear to us. Those we love. Those we cherish. Those without whom the very thought of passing our days seems unbearable. That is a weakness in us that we must face and conquer. For that very struggle is a part of this miracle we call life."
24,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_085","My loyal lackey! Your allies in the Scions have come seeking my alchemical genius! 'Twould seem I may be their only hope in understanding how the soul of a person not lost to Thal's cold halls could vanish so completely and abruptly!"
25,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_086","Hm hm hm. Heh heh heh. Mwahahahahaha...I honestly have no idea. There is much even alchemy has yet to explain about the mysteries of life and death."
26,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_090","I received the most curious missive from the Rising Stones regarding the Scions. Something about rifts in time... Would that I were familiar with such theorems. It sounds as though it would make for a rather intriguing field research."
27,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_091","Well, my able assistant, it would seem your Scion allies have returned from their jaunt across the rift. 'Tis a powerful magick indeed that could send living souls to distant worlds. Though it lies somewhat beyond the realm of alchemy, you may consider my curiosity piqued."
28,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_092","Heh heh heh... Eagerly have I awaited your arrival, my most able assistant! A little bird tells me you journeyed to the birthplace of alchemy─to Radz–at–Han! Come, you must share with me the wonders you have witnessed!"
29,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
30,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A2_000_001","How do you fare?"
31,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A2_000_002","What can you tell me of alchemy?"
32,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A2_000_003","Nothing."
33,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_100","Hah! Despite all the myriad possibilities of our craft that beg to be explored, you would inquire as to <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> well-being? Well, naturally I am spending every waking hour exploring the myriad possibilities of our craft!"
34,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_101","Though I have stood at what I thought to be the very peak of alchemical achievement, it was but one mountain among many that I now hope to conquer. And, as I work towards my goals, I even deign to accept a commission or two."
35,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_102","<sigh> I only wish that the requests of the wealthy were not so insufferably dull. If coin is no object, then why not ask of me a truly daunting and difficult task?"
36,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_103","Have you made no boastworthy discoveries of late? Remember: the world is our crucible, and an alchemist makes marvels of the mundane!"
37,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_105","I have taken an interest in these so-called “clones” of which you spoke. Fascinating things, really. Mayhap I will begin research in earnest..."
38,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_106","Hahaha! I say this in jest, of course. I already know more of Allagan magicks than most historians, having chased the notion of creating life as a hunter chases his prey."
39,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_107","The alchemists of eld undeniably learned the secret of life eternal. But I ask you, what did this knowledge bring them? Allag still perished, as every civilization does in the fullness of time."
40,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_108","The technologists failed to understand some secret of the mortal soul. Their copies of living men will never be enough to touch upon the truth of this world."
41,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_109","Remember, my assistant: the world is our crucible, and an alchemist makes wonders of the mundane. We may dig up the past and marvel at the miracles of the ancients, but our path is ever forward!"
42,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_200","You come calling merely to see how I am faring? And to what end, might I ask? Hmph, had I not known better, I'd say you were worried all that Heartstrike business had rekindled in me the urge to try my hand once more in those most forbidden and sinister of magicks."
43,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_201","As well you might. But believe me when I say, you need worry not. Perhaps, long ago, a younger and more fool version of myself would have been tempted to do so. But this is not that time, and I am not that man."
44,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_202","The man you see before you has learned a valuable lesson. No more will I spend my days in remembrance of and longing for those I have lost. For I have found that to devote myself to the here and now, to live for this day and the people in it, is a far more rewarding life. In that lesson, you were the master, and I the pupil. "
45,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_210","How do I fare? You, who have traveled to the heavens and back, would know how <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> fare!? Well, to answer your question...I have been thinking."
46,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_211","I imagined what I might do if the world were about to come to an end─if all the fruits of my research, all my past and future endeavors, were on the brink of annihilation..."
47,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_212","...And it appears that “despair” is not a part of my vocabulary! Such a useless, dreary emotion. Why, even if I had but moments left to exist, I would spend that time engrossed in my work!"
48,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_213","In any case, I had full confidence that my ever-resourceful apprentice could render even a threat of this magnitude inert. The impossible? Pah! You bend natural law to your will on a daily basis!"
49,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_110","You who have studied─some would say “suffered”─at my feet would know more of that subject than most. But I will, however, indulge your request with bemused magnanimity!"
50,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_111","To properly define the intricate and miraculous work of an alchemist would take days of lengthy explanation─an explanation that many simply would not understand. The simple appellation of “potion brewer” given to us by the masses is, however, largely accurate."
51,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_112","Restorative salves, ability-enhancing elixirs, deadly toxins and poisons─these are all substances that can be created through our versatile and practical profession."
