1,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A1_000_2","What is the lancer's art?"
4,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_2","I am Ywain, the master of the Lancers' Guild. My charge is to oversee the training of those who seek to master the polearm."
6,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_3","I served as a Wood Wailer until circumstance forced me to hang up my spear. It was then that I took up my post here, upon the recommendation of my former captain."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_4","That was shortly after the Calamity. I must confess that I was none too pleased to leave the front lines at first, but with time I came to appreciate my new role, and now I would not exchange it for any other. To see young lancers fulfilling their potential is a fine thing indeed, and to know that you have helped them is finer still."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_5","Among the martial disciplines, ours is the most offensively minded. We wager all on a single thrust, that we might pierce the enemy line and open a path to victory."
9,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_6","A lancer flinches not before his enemies, nor does he know the meaning of fear─yet there is a fine line between courage and folly. If you wish to become a lancer, you must learn to discern one from the other."
10,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_7","There exist myriad fighting styles, each of which has its own unique qualities. None, however, can claim to be as offensively minded as ours. Our approach is ever one of attack, no matter who─or what─we face."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_8","An experienced lancer is able to wield a polearm as if it were an extension of his body. He transforms into a raging storm before his foes, delivering a barrage of devastating thrusts and slashes."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_9","In order to facilitate such a relentless offense, we lancers favor armor of leather and chainmail─such things as provide adequate protection without sacrificing mobility."
13,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_10","The measure of a lancer's worth is truly quite simple: how swiftly and decisively he can pierce the enemy's defenses."
14,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_11","Very straightforward, I am sure you will agree. For this reason, our art provides the truest reflection of an individual's abilities, be it for good or ill."
15,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_020","'Tis good of you to come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Yours is an ever-welcome presence here."
16,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_030","You continue to go from strength to strength, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I should very much like to witness how your skills have evolved."
17,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_040","Rumor has it you have been framed for a vile crime. Would that I were in a position to help you, my friend, but for now, these words will have to suffice: no matter how grim the situation may seem, so long as you hold on to your courage and press forward, you will eventually find a path to salvation."
18,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_041","I am pleased to hear that you have been cleared of all charges. As befits a lancer, you faced your ordeal with composure and resolve, and in so doing, you have risen above it."
19,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_045","What an honor it is to have the world's savior grace our humble guild. Word of your courageous deeds travels swiftly, and I can scarcely believe the heights to which my former student has soared. To say you are a credit to the lancer's art barely begins to describe it!"
20,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_Q2_000_1","What will you ask?"
21,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A2_000_1","How fares the guild?"
22,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A2_000_2","What is the lancer's art?"
23,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A2_000_3","Nothing."
24,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_100","The guild fares well, and this is in no small part due to your positive influence, my friend."
25,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_101","Those guild members who had the chance to cross lances with you went on to improve in leaps and bounds."
26,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_102","Even those who but caught glimpse of you in action showed remarkable gains in skill and spirit."
27,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_103","As you have been an inspiration to them, so too will they become an inspiration to those who follow. And so the cycle continues."
28,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_104","As the master of this guild, I count my blessings that fate has seen fit to guide your steps to us."
29,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_105","Though several of our members joined the Ilsabard contingent, the rest of us were largely occupied with the defense of Gridania. Why, one of those dreaded blasphemies even appeared in the Black Shroud."
30,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_106","Indeed, there is no greater honor than to serve one's people in their time of need, but I do regret not having the opportunity to see you take to the field on this occasion."
31,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_107","From what I gather, you were a sight to behold, a whirlwind raging across the frozen plains. Mayhap one day, I might fight by your side once more."
32,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_110","You are the last person from whom I expected that question, my friend. But you have asked an earnest question, and so I shall answer in kind."
