1,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_011","Sadly, as you can very well see, we have had to close our doors while repairs are underway. As such, we have had no visitors of late, and I find myself with a wealth of spare time."
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_013","As a servant of Nald'thal, it saddens me that I have had to put aside my sacred duties for the nonce. I am, however, glad to be afforded the freedom to pursue my interests in the arcane."

4,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_Q1_000_001","What would you like to ask?"
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_A1_000_001","Tell me about yourself."
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_A1_000_002","What is a black mage?"
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_A1_000_003","Nothing."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_020","The origins of black magic can be traced back many, many years─to the beginning of the Fifth Astral Era, to be precise. There lived at that time in Eorzea a powerful sorceress named Shatotto, who strived to push the destructive power of magic to its very limits."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_021","The typical practice of magi is to weave magic using their own aether. The ability to do so is the greatest magical gift, yet at the same time that gift's greatest limit."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_022","Shatotto was able to overcome such inherent limitations by developing a new technique which allowed her to draw upon the aether all around her as the fount of her magic. It was this technique that came to be known as black magic."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_023","To take up the mantle of black mage is to revive this ancient art and command the aether everywhere to one's will."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_024","Following the War of the Magi and the Sixth Umbral Calamity, however, black magic was branded far too great a danger to life, and so its use and even its mere mention were made forbidden. Over time, it came to be forgotten entirely. Or so it was thought..."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_025","This changed one hundred years ago, when a prophet among mages stepped forth to revive this ancient and unrivaled art. That man was none other than my master and mentor, Ququruka Tataruka."

15,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_040","<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> of the black. Bringing to justice the vile thieves that stole the Book of Thal will be no trivial task. Have you mastered the destructive powers needed to do so?"
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_050","<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> of the black. The power within you grows. I daresay it now surpasses that of even the great Ququruka."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_060","<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> of the black. In joining Mistress Shatotto to deliver our realm from certain doom, your mastery of the art of destruction will be tested as never before. Slack not in your studies for even a moment."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_065","<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> of the black. The very founder of our ancient art has entrusted you with carrying on her legacy.

23,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_100","I was a fool, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. My single-minded devotion to my master blinded me to the truth, but you helped me to see..."
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_101","It brings me much comfort to know that he found peace in the end. I would not deny his crimes, but neither can I deny the man he once was, and all that he imparted to me."
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_102","Were he still with us, I would call him Master still. But he is not, and few will remember his name as fondly as I do. No, these feelings I must ever keep within..."
26,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_140","The book Ququruka left─the Book of Nald─is filled with secret black magic."
27,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_141","As the late master's disciple in the dark arts, I am duty-bound to see the fruits of his tireless research preserved."
28,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_142","I shall decipher the mysteries within the tome, and teach to you the destructive magicks therewithin. With this power, we shall recover the grimoire's twin─the Book of Thal!"
29,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_150","We have finally recovered both books of Nald'thal. And such fascinating books they are!"
30,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_151","The further I delve into the mysteries described within, the more awed I am by Ququruka's devotion to the dark arts─and the destructive power that his devotion unlocked."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_152","I shall not let these grimoires leave my sight. I cannot suffer to see them fall once more into the hands of some crazed madman. The War of the Magi has shown us the dangers inherent in these powers."
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_160","To feel the memory of Mistress Shatotto slumbering within me is a most curious sensation. I can feel the vastness of her knowledge, yet at the same time it is ever elusive, just outside my comprehension."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_161","Yet though I cannot grasp the full scope of her power, there could be no greater honor than to be chosen as a vessel by the mother of our art."
34,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_162","It would seem she has high hopes for you as well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You have my word that I will assist the both of you in any way I can."
35,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_165","I spend the better part of my days with quill in hand, recording every last detail of your adventures with Mistress Shatotto. I must say, just reading the words on the page is at times so thrilling my hair stands on end."
36,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_166","Reflecting back on all I have seen, I have come to a realization. Nothing has given me more pleasure than to watch your mastery of the art of destruction reach nigh-legendary heights."
37,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_167","Now that Mistress Shatotto herself has chosen you, there can be no doubt. <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> of the black─your name will go down in the annals of history with the greatest mages ever to walk this land."
38,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_170","While I cannot say I enjoy having to file these excruciatingly detailed reports to Master Cocobuki, it is indeed most liberating to be able to continue my arcane pursuits with the full blessing and support of the Order."
39,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_171","To think the day would come when I could peruse the myriads of tomes archived in the Ossuary in broad daylight! Needless to say, there is virtually boundless knowledge that may yet be reaped from this."
40,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_172","By comparing my own findings to those of Master Ququruka, I might learn much of how our art has changed and evolved as it was passed down through the years, and perhaps even unearth and revive aspects of it that have been lost to time."
41,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_173","I see Yayake muttering and mumbling to herself each time I walk past her on the way to the archives, but I say: let her mutter! I have never let the worries of smaller minds get in the way of my research, and I do <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> intend to start now."
42,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_175","Tales of your exploits in Garlemald and beyond have not escaped my ears. That the power of destruction that lies within you could bring salvation to those beset by war and calamity is a testament to your dedication to the dark arts."
43,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_176","As a matter of fact, Master Cocobuki urged me to join the Ilsabard contingent, alongside selected members of the guild."
44,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_177","To my eternal disgrace, however, that accursed Yayake saw fit to cast a sleeping enchantment upon me from the shadows. While my colleagues departed for parts unknown, I was left here, sleeping like a newborn! I shall never forgive her for robbing me of this chance of a lifetime."
45,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_110","Hm. I would think that <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> of all people, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, would know the answer to that.
