1,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_A1_000_2","What is carpentry?"
4,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_A1_000_4","Can I have another mask?"
6,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_2","As timbermaster of the Oak Atrium, I am responsible for all that transpires within these halls."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_3","Like all destined to take up the saw, I have been fascinated with the trees of the Twelveswood since I was a child."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_4","That brought me here, where I dedicated myself to practice, learning from my betters and through trial and error besides. In time, my efforts were recognized, and I was chosen to lead."
9,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_5","Some see carpenters as common craftsmen─laborers who work one wood or another into whatever form the customer demands."
10,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_6","But a carpenter must be more discerning than that. To read the lines in the lumber, to <Emphasis>know</Emphasis> the character of the tree that birthed it─<Emphasis>that</Emphasis> is what it means to be a carpenter."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_10","I presume you are asking in a philosophical sense. Very well. Carpentry is, at its core, an expression of love─a love of wood, and of what it may become."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_11","To address your question more directly, carpentry is the origin of the bow, the lance, and the shield─tools any self-respecting adventurer should know. All were the creations of master carpenters."
13,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_12","A master understands the myriad characteristics of every tree in the Twelveswood. He knows the ideal wood for any given task, and has perfected the techniques needed to utilize the unique strengths of that wood."
14,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_13","Of course, such knowledge and skill would count for little without a ready supply of quality lumber, and we have the Greatloam Growery to thank for that. Were it not for the botanists, there would be no Oak Atrium─just a rabble of carpenters pining for want of a straight stick."
15,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_14","But thanks to our friends at the Growery, we can freely choose our materials, and craft goods needed by the people of Gridania. To proudly serve─<Emphasis>that</Emphasis> is the soul of carpentry."
16,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_20","Twelve as my witness... I will not bother speculating how you lost the mask, though I find it hard to believe it was not <Emphasis>intentional</Emphasis>."
17,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_21","See that you don't lose <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> one. Now stop wasting time and continue your quest. This minstrel's tale cannot reach its climax till all the players be assembled."

What<Else/>─although <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> appears to have misplaced one of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> limbs, which is most disconcerting. Anyway, what</If> would you ask of me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
19,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_060","Well, well... How fares our fugitive?"
20,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_061","Yes, I am aware of your troubles─and the questionable integrity of your accusers. Remain strong and resolute as a heavenspillar, and you shall weather this storm."
21,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_070","In returning the broken spear, you have found a new client? Well, I trust you can put to good use the tricks of the trade you learned from me."
22,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_080","Bravo, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! An adamantite trident is a rare and precious weapon, and you ought take great pride in having crafted one. In fact, word of it had reached Gridania more swiftly than you did."
23,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_081","Cemi is like a sapling. With enough care and attention she will flourish. Without it, however, she will slowly wither away."
24,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_082","Lately, I have been reminded that no matter how promising they may seem, training a new recruit requires a great deal of dedication. They are nothing like trees, which need naught but a bit of water and sunlight to thrive."
25,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_083","Gairhard has asked that I pass along his thanks to you. By your saw have his men finally learned to see eye to eye."
26,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
27,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_A2_000_001","How are things?"
28,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_A2_000_002","What is carpentry?"

30,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_A2_000_004","Can I have another mask?"
31,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_100","You are asking after Gairhard, I presume. We are─and ever will be─friends."
32,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_101","We had an opportunity to speak at length before his last mission, and we managed to reach an understanding."
33,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_102","...Oh, and you will be pleased to hear that the bow you crafted has served him well."
34,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_120","I am, as ever I have been, tender caretaker of the younglings and saplings of Gridania. Yet watching you grow does make me feel my age. Mayhap I am now but an old plant, waiting to wither and die."
35,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_121","I meant that as a jest, of course. Treasures that they are, the children would suffer tremendously for my loss. As would the Twelveswood, I daresay."
36,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_122","But rest assured, I do take great pleasure in your accomplishments, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. And if I can teach others to grow as you have, all the better."
37,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_130","I have been referring clients to Cemi recently, and all of them have been absolutely delighted with her work."
38,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_131","It seems she has finally learned to put the needs of her customers first, instead of attempting to simply showcase the extent of her own abilities."
39,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_132","As I have said before and will say again, I have high hopes for the girl. I imagine that one day she might even come to rival you."
40,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_140","I was under the impression Cemi was diligently studying Eastern woodworking techniques from the local masters of Radz–at–Han when she was away. This letter suggests otherwise, however. It arrived shortly before her return."

In particular, I've become quite enamored with the local cuisine, especially the simply divine dish they call hamsa curry. You simply must try it if you haven't already! Till we meet again.
Yours truly,

43,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_143","It would seem I've been too lenient with the girl. Well, I hope she enjoyed her leisure time abroad, as she's in for a rude awakening..."
44,"TEXT_REGFSTWDKGUILD_00029_BEATINE_000_110","For an accomplished carpenter such as yourself to ask that question is inconceivable. What am I to make of this inexplicable ignorance? I can only assume that you wish to educate a fledgling carpenter with my words..."
