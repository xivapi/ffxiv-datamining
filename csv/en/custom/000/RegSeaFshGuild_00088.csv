5,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_010","I'm Sisipu, the guildmaster. Well, technically, acting guildmaster."
6,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_011","The actual guildmaster, Wawalago, apparently has better things to do than administer a guild, and so it falls to me."
7,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_012","In hindsight, the thought of a fisherman neglecting his duties shouldn't have come as such a surprise to me."
8,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_020","Our guild members live by a simple code: we catch fish."
9,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_021","From serene seas to roaring rivers, from large lagoons to puny ponds, where there are fish to be fished, the Fishermen's Guild will fish them."
10,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_022","Fishing with nets can yield a fair haul, but requires a ship and trustworthy shiphands. Since you haven't access to a vessel nor any apparent friends, we will not concern ourselves with nets."
11,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_023","“Spare the rod and spoil the adventurer,” as they say. You'll not need an army aboard a dreadnaught to catch a fish─you will need only a rod and your wits."
12,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_024","Quite fitting for a self-sufficient adventurer like yourself, do you not agree? After all, what sort of adventurer wants to browse the nets for hours upon hours when you could be enjoying the great outdoors with a rod and reel?"
13,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_030","Well, look what the coeurl dragged in. How goes it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
14,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_040","Now there's a sight for sore eyes. I believed the Admiral when she said you wriggled through the Ul'dahns' nets, but it's still a comfort to find you here in the flesh."
15,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_041","Aye, most people in positions of power know all about your situation. Wawalago doesn't know a thing, though─and I've a mind to keep it that way. He'd never let a fish slip free from his hook, but a secret from his lips? Now that's a different story."
16,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_050","I've decided to follow in your footsteps, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and find out more about fish from further afield. If I'm going to bring this guild up to date with all the latest information, I'd better start brushing up!"
17,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_060","So, the prodigal <If(PlayerParameter(4))>daughter<Else/>son</If> returns!

18,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_070","Whatever it was that the guildmaster was working so hard to keep secret from me, he clearly had no qualms about sharing with you. This just goes to show how much he trusts you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Promise you'll keep him out of trouble for me, okay?"
19,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_080","Ever since you helped solve the mystery of the disappearing harutsuge, it's like a whole new fire's been lit under the guildmaster's behind. Not a day goes by when he's not hopping off to some newfound fishing hole in lands near and far. Which means he's doing about as much work around here as ever, needless to say."
20,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"

24,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_100","Sea serpent balderdash notwithstanding, I'd say it's the same as ever."
25,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_101","Which is to say that the fishermen are fishing, the guildmaster is gallivanting, and I'm still saddled with administrative duties."
26,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_102","I swear, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, one of these days... One of these days..."
27,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_120","Well, you're quite a hero around these parts, aren't you? You brought home the Nepto Dragon in your creel, after all!"
28,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_121","A role model you are for the younger fishers, aye, and we've a dearth of any <Emphasis>good</Emphasis> role models, to be sure."
29,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_122","But the daily grind will get you, too, if you aren't careful... You'll soon find yourself saddled with all manner of duties before you can say, “Um, Wawalago!” Then it's farewell Dragoncatcher, hello administrative drudge...and another role model is lost to the guild. <sigh>"
30,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_130","The past few moons, half the folk who've passed through here have had a tale to tell about you, but you know how fishermen fib─ilms become yalms, and yalms become malms... The way they tell it, you're well on your way to catching every fish in Eorzea!"
31,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_131","Even Wawalago's keeping one ear open to hear of your heroics. If you ever want to share some of your stories of angling and adventure, I'm sure our guildmaster would make a most attentive audience."
32,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_140","I told Wawalago all about how you'd been fishing in the farthest-flung reaches of the realm. He pretended he was unimpressed, but I could tell he was burning with jealousy deep down inside."
33,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_141","I thought that hearing about your heroics would light a fire under his bone-idle behind, but it didn't quite work in the way I intended..."
34,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_142","The work-shy wastrel still won't give me a helping hand with any administrative duties─instead, he's devoted himself to winking and whistling at every passing wench with wild abandon. It got him going, alright, but in completely the wrong direction!"
35,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_150","To think it was out of concern for <Emphasis>me</Emphasis> that Wawalago kept his dealings with the Sahagin a secret. If he's that concerned, he could start by pulling his own weight around here from time to time..."
36,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_151","We all have painful memories we'd rather not recall, but even those have helped to shape us into who we are. All we can do is make peace with them in our own way, and carry on as best we can."
37,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_152","That's a lesson I've learned from the people around me. Including you, of course─and even the guildmaster, though I'd sooner be gutted like a fish than admit it to him!"
38,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_160","I'm glad all that business with horrible creatures and burning skies is over. While it was still going on, I tried telling Wawalago not to go on any deep-sea fishing trips, but did he listen?"
39,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_161","He insisted that in times of crisis, the best thing to do is carry on as normal. Not that I disagree with that sentiment entirely, but he could show a <Emphasis>bit</Emphasis> of restraint!"
40,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_162","Still, I must admit it put other guild members' minds at ease to see him <Emphasis>so</Emphasis> nonchalant in the face of imminent doom. If ignorance is bliss, he must be happy as a pig in muck."
