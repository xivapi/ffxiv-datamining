7,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_5","When folks think of a bard, they conjure images of a minstrel wandering the realm, performing at banquets and in alehouses for the pleasure of king and commoner alike."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_6","But the bard I would speak of is one born from a battle-hardened archer─one who sings <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> songs in the heat of combat to inspire <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> comrades to ever greater feats of martial prowess."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_7","As battles unfold, the distinction between the lines of friend and foe grows hazy. Yet the archer must stay ever alert, with arrow nocked and eyes trained upon the struggle. One need not have a vivid imagination to appreciate the torrent of emotions that rages within <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> in that moment."

14,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_040","When I was but a young lad, I heard many a tale of the Autumn War from my elders. I cannot well imagine what this damning secret might be."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_045","Aye, I have heard of Sanson's capture. Never before have I seen Guydelot distressed so. He truly cares for his friend, and suffice it to say I will spare no effort in seeing him rescued."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_050","Both Sanson and Guydelot have grown much in the course of their recent trials. And it is to your inspiring presence, I believe, that they owe who they are become now."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_053","Though our performance is expressly for the benefit of the recruits, I am personally looking forward to the opportunity to play with you and Guydelot."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_055","That was a performance I shan't soon forget. My breast still thrums from the joy of the experience."
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_060","Recently, I went to train Sanson's men, and what a pleasant surprise it was! In the short time since we performed for them, they have improved in leaps and bounds. The day is not far now when bards become a mainstay of Gridania's military."
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_065","Seldom have I been more proud than the day Sanson and Guydelot were called upon to accompany you on the venture into Garlemald. Even so, such peril is not to be made light of, and full glad was I to hear they had returned safely."

26,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_101","Yes, at long last the realm remembers the true role of the bard, and your accomplishments have done much to that end. Why, I've even seen the hot-blooded young lads of the Gods' Quiver spending the occasional hour honing their voice as they do their aim."
27,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_150","Though their betters have been less than cooperative, the men and women of the Gods' Quiver show no small amount of interest in your quest for the Ballad of Oblivion."
28,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_151","And though Sanson and Guydelot are as opposites, they share a love for song─a love that is strong and true. Given time, I believe that they will come to understand one another. Till then, pray watch over them, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
29,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_160","'Tis no small coup to usher in change to an organization, even for those in a position of authority. It will be some time yet before Sanson's dream of a new unit is realized."
30,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_161","But he remains determined, as does Guydelot, who continues to impress me with his progress in our art. The two of them will accomplish much together, of this I have no doubt."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_170","Since Sanson's new unit received formal approval, I have kept busy doing my part for it. Namely, training a new generation of bards."

36,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_191","Nor am I the only one to gain newfound inspiration. More often than before, I see Guydelot venturing deep into the wood, where he loses himself in his strumming."
37,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_192","Little does he suspect that he has an audience─in the form of Sanson and the recruits. See that you do not spill this to Guydelot, yes?"

39,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_201","From afar, I did hear the echo of some baleful roar, and fear spread like wildfire. The skies were filled with birds in flight, though they know not where to flee, and even the trees themselves were set aquiver."
40,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_202","But this forest is no stranger to calamity, and harmony was eventually restored...for reasons better known to you than I."
