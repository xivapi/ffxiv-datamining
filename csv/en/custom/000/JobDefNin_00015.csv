1,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_Q1_000_001","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_A1_000_001","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_A1_000_002","Tell me about Oboro."
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_A1_000_003","What is a ninja?"
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_A1_000_004","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_010","I am called Yomei. I hail from Doma, far, far across the seas to the east. And I am a shinobi, like my father before me."
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_011","My father lost his life in battle when the Garleans invaded our land, leaving me alone in this world. When Oboro told me of his mission, I asked to join him, that I, too, might have my revenge against the traitorous demon who betrayed us."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_012","I am but a <Emphasis>genin</Emphasis>, the least experienced of our kind, and Oboro insists that I am still too young for battle. I believe I am ready, but I do not question his judgment. And so I assist in what ways I can while devoting myself to my training."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_030","Oboro is a true shinobi─strong in body and mind. As a teacher, he is stern yet gentle. I look up to him as the elder brother I never had, as did many in my village."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_031","He was the first to step forth and accept this mission. There were many of our kind─<Emphasis>jonin</Emphasis> with the strength and wisdom of years─who chose to stay home in the village rather than chase the traitor to this far-flung realm. Yet Oboro insists there was not a moment's hesitation in his heart."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_032","The elders eyed him skeptically. Perhaps they felt his experience and ability did not measure up to his ambition. But I know different─and when Oboro returns home, his mission complete, the elders will know what I know."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_020","My people are the descendants of an ancient clan that traces its origins back to an age of war and strife. My ancestors isolated themselves in a secluded village and devoted themselves to the martial arts, that they might defend themselves and their land from the chaos around them."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_021","At first, my ancestors lived solitary lives. In time, however, their martial abilities came to be recognized by mighty warlords, who enlisted their services. So it was that my ancestors came to serve from the shadows, performing assassinations, espionage, and other such disagreeable-yet-indispensable duties."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_022","In the early days, my ancestors were known by many names: the shadow, the grass, the silent ones, those who see but are not seen... In time, as our existence became widely known and accepted by the greater populace, the people came to call us by a single name: <Emphasis>shinobi</Emphasis>, the hidden."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_023","Our art─the art of ninjutsu─has been honed through the centuries, passed down from master to student, master to student. The shinobi uses ritual hand gestures called <Emphasis>mudra</Emphasis> to channel the energies of the world around him─heaven, earth, and man─and unleash a host of lethal attacks."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_024","There are many aspects of our art that we ourselves do not fully understand. For example, when a shinobi loses his concentration and misforms a mudra, it has been known to summon forth a curious rabbit-like creature from dimensions unknown."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_025","Ah, I can see it even now─that toothy grin staring at me, mocking me! Oh, that I would never lay eyes on one of those foul creatures again!"
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_090","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You honor us with your presence. How might Yomei serve you today?"
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_030_099","Master Oboro is as sullen as I have ever seen him. Whatever troubles him so?"
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_040_099","Please look after Master Oboro, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It is not that I doubt his judgment, of course, but one never knows what tricks Karasu has up his sleeve..."
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_Q2_000_1","What will you ask?"
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_A2_000_1","How fare you of late?"
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_A2_000_2","What is a ninja?"
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_A2_000_3","Nothing."
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_100","We fare quite well. With no word from the village asking him to hasten his return, Master Oboro intends to remain here for the foreseeable future to continue his study of Eorzean culture. With the immediate danger having passed, he has even agreed to resume my lessons, which pleases me greatly."
26,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_101","Though he does not readily admit it, I suspect he has grown quite fond of this realm. I remember the days when he struggled to stomach any Eorzean fare, but the other day─why, I saw him enjoying a glass of aldgoat milk! When I expressed my admiration, he said that anything is possible if one's mind is focused to the task."
27,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_102","Master Oboro's feelings remain conflicted─finding out the truth about Master Gekkai surely affected him more than anyone─yet I, for one, have found peace in knowing that my father's death has been avenged. I once thought Master Oboro a brother, but today I am proud to call him Master."
28,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_010_100","Life has changed little since last we spoke. We await orders from our village, and serve as Master Oboro's eyes, ears, and blades in the meantime."
29,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_010_101","However, he has been in high spirits of late. Why, he drinks aldgoat milk every morning now─much to the surprise of the rest of us."
30,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_010_102","But enough of this─I have heard new paths are opening to you <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It is pleasing to me, that one of another land pursue our arts with such vigor."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_010_103","As one shinobi to another, I am glad of your progress. No doubt we have you to thank for Master Oboro's mood as well."
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_020_100","I have heard of Princess Yuki's departure. But there has been no missive from the village elders, congratulatory or otherwise, and I believe we have Tsubame to thank for that."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_020_101","I suspect Master Oboro is secretly grateful for this further reprieve. He has grown very fond of this land, and would be loath to return to the village just now."
34,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_020_102","I wonder if the thought of leaving hangs heavy over his head, however. Of late, he is all sighs and distracted looks. It is even rumored he misformed a mudra, and called a─ Ah, but I have already said too much."
35,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_030_100","Master Oboro has departed for Kugane, but I have received no tidings from him yet. I do hope all is well..."
36,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_030_101","Ever since he was told that he was not needed back at the village, I swear he has not stopped sighing for a second. This, despite it being his own idea to lie to the elders so he could remain here in the first place!"
37,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_030_102","He is a good man, and a model to all shinobi, but sometimes I just want to slap some─ah, forgive me, friend. I am but a genin, and I forget myself."
38,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_040_100","You have met with Master Oboro in Kugane? I trust he is doing well."
39,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_040_101","Though his constant hand-wringing can get wearisome, I cannot begrudge the man his worries. After all, he has many matters weighing on his mind."
40,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_040_102","His duty to the village elders, his duty to his loyal followers here, and his duty to what he believes in─these are not always one and the same. We are most fortunate to have such a thoughtful leader."
41,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_050_100","Master Oboro has returned, and it is as if he has returned a new man. How can I put it? It would seem that he has found the courage of his convictions."
42,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_050_101","The sighs have ceased, and his every action is carried out with purpose. He says that he must live up to Master Sasuke's example, and I daresay he resembles our forefather─what I have heard of him, at least─more and more by the day."
43,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_050_102","What's more, every time he speaks of his pursuit of Karasu, I swear I can see the slightest hint of a sparkle in his sullen eyes─hm? Of course that is a compliment, friend. I would never speak ill of Master Oboro."
44,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_060_100","For better or for worse, everything is much as one would expect. Oboro is pursuing his rival, Karasu, with more zeal and dogged persistence than ever...and little in the way of actual success."
45,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_060_101","That said, who would have thought that the Oboro that returned to us from the Hermit's Hovel was actually Karasu in disguise? That crafty crow certainly had me fooled."
46,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_060_102","But looking back now that I know the truth, there was something...off about Oboro's behavior. How can I say it? He seemed strangely...personable? Amiable? Pleasant? Perhaps I should stop there..."
47,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_070_100","When Master Oboro caught word that a great beast had emerged from the tower in Yanxia, he immediately began making preparations to go to his countrymen's aid."
48,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_070_101","Imagine our surprise when we contacted the Eastern alliance only to be told that the menace had already been quelled, and supposedly by my master's own hand."
49,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_070_102","It would appear that Karasu is up to his old tricks, disguising himself as my master and performing feats of derring-do in his name. The fact that witnesses to the battle said that the hero was laughing all the while would seem to corroborate this."
50,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_070_103","I was certain Master Oboro would choose to reveal the truth, but he steadfastly refused to blow Karasu's cover, so that he might continue to monitor him from afar. Taking credit for the deed was surely no more than an unintended side effect."
51,"TEXT_JOBDEFNIN_00015_YOUMEI_000_110","Is this some kind of test, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Surely a skilled <Emphasis>jonin</Emphasis> such as yourself could answer that question better than I. Ah, but forgive me─it is not Yomei's place to question, but to answer."
