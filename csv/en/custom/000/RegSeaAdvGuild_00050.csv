1,"TEXT_REGSEAADVGUILD_00050_SDHODJBI_000_2","I serve the louts and drunkards that stumble in through the door. Baderon, the owner, quit the mercenary life to open this place, but he's still more comfortable holding a blade than a mop. So I take care of whatever cleaning needs doing as well."
2,"TEXT_REGSEAADVGUILD_00050_SDHODJBI_000_3","It's a damn sight better than what I was doing after the Calamity hit, let me tell you. Lost about as much as a person can lose, and spent my nights puking cheap ale into the gutter. Baderon found me passed out outside his place one morning, so he took me in, cleaned me up, and helped me swear off the worst of the grog."

7,"TEXT_REGSEAADVGUILD_00050_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
8,"TEXT_REGSEAADVGUILD_00050_A1_000_2","The “Drowning Wench.” That's a little morbid, isn't it?"
