6,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_3","Following the Admiral's reformation of this guild and the purging of its pirate influences, I was invited to don the mantle of “Axemaster.”"
7,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_4","It is an honor I accepted with a gratitude I continue to feel. Thanks to the Admiral's offer, I can now share my combat experience and skills with a new generation of marauders, instead of sitting in an alehouse and bemoaning the injury that removed me from the front lines of battle."

You should know that we've had visitors to the guild, offering heavy purses for information on your movements. A futile effort.

23,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_101","Ever since, Blauthota has needed her own axe to fend off the hordes of marauder aspirants. Your deeds have become legend, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
24,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_102","This new wave of novices lacks your natural aptitude for carnage, but they certainly make up for it in enthusiasm. Perhaps you might stop past the training hall and give them a demonstration some time."
25,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_110","I instruct initiates in the way of the axe, as I have always done, but Solkwyb tells me you have progressed far beyond the skills I have taught you."

28,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_131","Speaking of which, how fares Dorgono? She hasn't given you too much trouble, I hope. We were expecting Curious Gorge to have a change of heart and commit to training her, so you can imagine our surprise when he showed up at our doorstep."

30,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_141","Word has it that Dorgono has gained control of her inner beast and returned home to the Azim Steppe. I can only assume Curious Gorge completed his training as well. He hasn't been back to the guild in some time."
31,"TEXT_REGSEAEXCGUILD_00053_WYRNZOEN_000_150","Your prowess on the battlefield is all Broenbhar seems to talk about since returning from Garlemald."
