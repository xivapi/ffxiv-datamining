0,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000","Greetings! Is there something you want to ask about the Goldsmiths' Guild?"
1,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_2","What is goldsmithing?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_4","Can I have another set of earrings?"
6,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_010","People call me Mistress Serendipity, but you can call me Sera!"
7,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_011","I was recently appointed guildmaster, so this is all still quite new to me. My predecessor abruptly retired, you see...but that's a long, sordid story that I'm sure you'd rather not hear."
8,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_012","Now, I may not have much experience managing people, but I <Emphasis>am</Emphasis> a very good goldsmith─even if I do say so myself! Those who train under me are guaranteed to learn a thing or two!"
9,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_020","Though we're called <Emphasis>gold</Emphasis>smiths, we actually work with various kinds of precious metals and gemstones, all of which are abundant in Thanalan."
10,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_021","Smelting, casting, cutting, polishing─we use all these techniques to craft beautiful baubles that delight the eyes."
11,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_022","Mind you, the things we make aren't simply for show─a great many possess magical properties. And of course, we craft scepters and staves that thaumaturges use to channel their magicks."
12,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_023","When you think about all the variety goldsmithing has to offer, it's really quite exciting!"
13,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_030","You want <Emphasis>what</Emphasis>!? You can't be serious! <Emphasis>Gods</Emphasis>..."
14,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_031","Just this once, but remember─life is not a minstrel's song, and you aren't some chosen hero. So don't go around expecting people to forgive you no matter the reckless, irresponsible things you do."
15,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_040","Why, hello there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. How is our little princess doing?"
16,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_041","Sorry, sorry. That was a bit rude of me, wasn't it. How are <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> doing?"
17,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_061","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Are the rumors true? Are you the victim of a vast conspiracy!? Oh dear, I probably shouldn't speak so loudly..."
18,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_062","I've given thought to how we might distract your pursuers. Perhaps a mammet fashioned in your image which nods at regular intervals? No? Hmmm...I was rather proud of that idea..."
19,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_050","Ah! <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>! How's every little thing? You haven't been trying to repair mammets behind my back, have you?"
20,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_070","Hard at work on your commission for Marcel, I see. His clients are demanding, but if anyone can produce a masterpiece that will win them over, it's you─I'm sure of it!"
21,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_075","As guildmaster, allow me to offer my most sincere congratulations and commendations for your work on those most magnificent music boxes. Marcel was practically dancing on his way back to Eshtaime's!"
22,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_076","Perhaps you noticed, but Master Colbernoux was with me in the Quicksand when you unveiled your creations. He looked me straight in the eye and said it was a true masterpiece worthy of his muse. You should be proud, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─my master isn't one to give praise lightly!"
23,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_080","It won't be easy teaching our craft in a foreign land, but it's a worthwhile cause. And with you in charge, I have every confidence that things will go swimmingly!"
24,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_085","So, it's off to Gyr Abania. Things may get a little hairy on the road, so take care, alright?"
25,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_090","Oh, the orchestrion you made for the sultana is simply adorable! I would love to have one just like it. You know, my nameday <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> coming up soon..."
26,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_095","Ah, to what do I owe the honor, Schoolmaster <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>? ...Hehe, I'll bet you enjoyed being called that!"
27,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
28,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_001","How fares the guild?"
29,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_002","What is goldsmithing?"
30,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_003","Nothing."
31,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_4","Can I have another set of earrings?"
32,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_100","So very, very busy! Our members are working day and night to fill commissions for clients throughout Eorzea, and of course I must supervise. I swear, sometimes it feels as though I never leave this spot!"
33,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_101","I like that it keeps me occupied. When it's not so busy, I start to wonder about silly things, like if he would've really pulled the trigger..."
34,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_102","Perhaps I'm due for a sabbatical. I've been thinking about it more ever since a client of ours invited me to his beachside holdings in eastern La Noscea."
35,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_103","Of course, the moment I tell Gigi about Gegeruju's offer, he begins raving about “secrets and lies” again. I mean, I know Gigi was right about Robert or whatever his name was, but what ulterior motives could Gegeruju possibly have?"
36,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_105","Busier and busier─and in no small part due to the acclaim your twin music boxes have won, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. This is a good thing, of course...not that it stops Gigi from complaining."
37,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_106","Oh, yes, he's back to his usual self. Why, if I didn't know better, I'd even say the new cylinder you fashioned for him has augmented his vocabulary of oaths and obscenities tenfold."
38,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_107","Why, just the other day he had the nerve to compare my girth to that of an overstuffed goobbue! Now, it's true that my waist size has grown by one-sixteenth of an ilm since I last measured, but that's hardly cause for insults, wouldn't you say?"
39,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_108","Why, I might enjoy a piece of pineapple ponzecake from time to time, but if anything I'm healthier than I've always been! Not that a spindly little mammet would know anything about how difficult it is for a woman to watch her figure...but what were we talking about, again?"
40,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_110","How we're faring? I thought you'd never ask, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
41,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_111","I am proud to say that I have lost weight! One-thirty-second of an ilm around the waist, to be precise."
42,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_112","Gigi said so, so it must be true. He has an eye for these things, for better or worse, and he never lies...for better or worse."
43,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_113","Well, to be sure, one-thirty-second of an ilm may not sound like much, but to us goldsmiths it is the difference between a crude bauble and a masterpiece. Of which I am, of course, the latter."
44,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_120","We've recently taken possession of some of those marvelous warding scales that proved oh-so important in your recent adventures."
45,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_121","I can scarcely believe such dainty things hold such incredible power. We must have Vrtra to thank for their aetherial properties, though it strikes me that dragon scales are not the most readily available of materials..."
46,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_122","Perhaps there is a way we might replicate such an effect..."
47,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_123","Well, I for one am not afraid of a little friendly competition with our Hannish counterparts! I and the other guild members will spare no effort in pushing the boundaries of our art!"
48,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_110","Ahaha─ Oh, you're serious. Well, if you really want me to explain it to you..."
49,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_111","Though we're called <Emphasis>gold</Emphasis>smiths, we actually work with various kinds of precious metals and gemstones, all of which are abundant in Thanalan."
50,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_112","Smelting, casting, cutting, polishing─we use all these techniques to craft beautiful baubles that delight the eyes."
51,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_113","Mind you, the things we make aren't simply for show─a great many possess magical properties. And of course, we craft scepters and staves that thaumaturges use to channel their magicks."
52,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_114","...Out of curiosity, are you feeling well? You didn't hit your head on something, did you? No? Hmmm... Maybe you don't remember doing it...?"
53,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_TALK_ACTOR","Greetings! Is there something you want to ask about the Goldsmiths' Guild?"
