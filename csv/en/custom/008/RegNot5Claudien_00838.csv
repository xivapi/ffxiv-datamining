0,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_000","I began researching the Heart of Sabik almost immediately upon my return, but quickly ran out of leads to follow. So I've changed tack, and now am focusing my efforts on learning more about the relationship between Athena and the auracite she found."
1,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_001","To that end, I intend to dive into the legends of Ivalice and any other extant stories wherein auracite makes an appearance. If you come across aught that could be of use to us, be it legends or even firsthand experiences, then I would be grateful if you shared them with us."
2,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_010","With both the aetherial sea and the Heart of Sabik to keep my mind occupied, I feel that I shall never again lack for fascinating discoveries to motivate my work!"
3,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_020","Given the peaceful state of Pandæmonium at present─er, past?─I see no reason that the keyward wouldn't allow you a moment of Erichthonios's time."
4,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_040","Both the aetherial sea and the Heart of Sabik are yet brimming with secrets to be discovered... I can hardly remember the last time my days were so exciting! Please, if there's ever anything we can help you with, do visit again."
5,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
6,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_A1_000_001","What do you know of Athena and her connection to auracite?"
7,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_A1_000_002","How goes your research?"
8,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_A1_000_010","Nothing."
9,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_100_050","Ah, that topic has been keeping us quite busy as of late. Nemjiji and Ruissenaud have been a great help in making sense of all these fabulous tales─I shall call them at once so we can share our findings thus far."
10,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_050","Our research into the Heart of Sabik has led us through many magnificent legends and tales from bygone civilizations, some of which mention─or at least hint at─the presences of Athena, auracite, and the High Seraph Ultima."
11,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_051","While we have formed an operating theory based on our findings, it is impossible for us to confirm its feasibility. Given your experience with the High Seraph, however, I can think of no one better with whom to discuss it. "
12,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_NEMJIJI_000_052","Although we know not the precise timing of the High Seraph's visit to this star, we do know that Athena somehow came into possession of a mysterious crystal said to be the source of the destructive magic known as Ultima."
13,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_NEMJIJI_000_053","According to Lahabrea, it was Athena who gave this crystal the name of “auracite,” and from her tireless research was born the Heart of Sabik."
14,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_NEMJIJI_000_054","The Heart of Sabik contained not only Athena's memories, but a concentration of aether unlike anything we have observed. Even a small portion of it could level mountains."
15,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_055","It did, in fact, level Castrum Meridianum not so long ago."
16,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_056","Records of your previous encounter with Lahabrea imply that the Heart was, for a time, in the hands of the Allagan Empire. Doubtless it was the Ascian himself who gifted it to them, thus sowing the seeds of calamity."
17,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_057","The Allagans made little progress toward penetrating its mysteries, but some scholars attribute the fact that they were able to use it at all to theoretical encounters between Allag's researchers and the High Seraph."
18,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_058","Regardless of its journey, however, we do know that the Heart of Sabik returned to Lahabrea's clutches soon after the Fourth Umbral Calamity. The rest hardly bears going over again."
19,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_NEMJIJI_000_059","Tracing the legends of auracite back to their source suggest that the High Seraph may be the cause of countless tragedies, including our most recent one."
20,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_NEMJIJI_000_060","Regardless of the auracite's source, however, it was Athena's bottomless ambition that set the wheels of tragedy in motion."
21,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_RUISSENAUD_000_061","...I found one of Lahabrea's remarks most odd. While we were discussing Athena, he said that he was a fool to think she could be confined. He didn't elaborate on the statement, but I think there's a possibility that Pandæmonium was built not as a prison for failed creations, but to contain his very own wife."
22,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_062","We already know he was well aware of the influence auracite had on Athena─'tis not beyond the realm of possibility that Pandæmonium's true purpose was to keep her isolated from the other ancients."
23,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_063","Even so, she had freedom enough to continue her research outside of Lahabrea's purview. Perhaps it was his love for her that kept him from tightening his grip on her activities."
24,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_100","Fortunately for my assistants and I, my ordeal has left me none the worse for wear. I am back at work with characteristic aplomb─well, as much aplomb as can be mustered when reviewing the many records which have piled up in my absence."
25,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_101","Of course, I have made the proper shows of gratitude to Scholarch Montichaigne and Master Fourchenault for their efforts to search for me."
26,"TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_102","Master Fourchenault was stone-faced, claiming that he had only done his duty. The scholarch, on the other hand, seemed most eager to learn every detail. It takes all sorts, I suppose."
