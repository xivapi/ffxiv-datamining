1,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_Q1_000_001","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_A1_000_001","What is the Starlight Celebration?"
3,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_A1_100_002","Why are you holding a concert?"
4,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_A1_000_003","What's your task in all this?"
5,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_A1_000_004","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_010","The Starlight Celebration can be traced back to ancient Ishgard. Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_011","Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms."
8,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_012","Owing to their generosity, the children survived the winter and lived to pay forward the kindness they had received. The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_013","Over the years, the celebration has undergone gradual changes. The snowy-bearded captain of the kind-hearted knights has become known as the “Saint of Nymeia,” and children believe that he delivers their hopes and prayers directly to the goddess Herself."
10,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_014","Similarly, his red-jacketed knights have become the “saint's little helpers.” They are particularly beloved by the younglings, for it is their role to bring gifts to every child who sends a prayer to the Spinner."
11,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_100_015","The tradition of the Starlight choir, much like the Starlight Celebration itself, originated in ancient Ishgard. One particularly harsh winter in the most remote, snowbound settlements of Coerthas, a group of children were praying to Nymeia to see them safely through to the spring."
12,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_100_016","However, the children's small voices were all too easily smothered by the ceaseless howling blizzards, and faded into the wind before they could reach the Spinner's ears."
13,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_100_017","The adults who witnessed this had an idea─they would gather from among them those men and women with the strongest and most resonant voices, and set their prayers to song."
14,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_100_018","Wishing not to dilute the strength and purity of their divine plea, they eschewed the accompaniment of musical instruments. Their clarion voices pierced the driving snow and rang out far across the land and in the heavens above...or so the legend goes."
15,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_100_019","And so we have chosen to pay tribute to this tradition by holding a concert of our own. We have recruited some of our most musically inclined men and women to serenade the children with a song praying for their health and happiness."
16,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_020","My scarlet-clad colleagues and I have been charged by the Adventurers' Guild with running the Starlight Celebration. The festival spans the entire realm of Eorzea, and we have little helpers stationed in the cities of Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah."
17,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_021","On this particular occasion, we will be hosting a concert here in Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, with a choir reviving Ishgardian traditions of eld─a rare treat not to be missed!"
18,"TEXT_FESXMS2019_00641_GUIDEXMS2019_000_022","To spread yet more festive cheer, each child in attendance will receive a special gift at the end of the show. It is sure to draw in crowds from every corner of the realm."
