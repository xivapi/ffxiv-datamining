11,"TEXT_FESPDY2020LETTER_00670_LETTERB00670_000_022","(-Letter to a Fierce Gladiator-)For as long as I can remember, I've been sickly. I feel like I spend more time in the Phrontistery than out of it. I've always wished I could be like the gladiators I see around the city, so strong and healthy, as if they've never spent a single moment in a sickbed."

Everyone here at the Phrontistery says my baking is delicious, and the tarts I made for them were devoured in the space of one bell! "

So that's why I want a master cook to taste something I make with my own hands, and I want an honest opinion. No sugar-coating, please."

The songs were so captivating and the dances were so extravagant. My memory of that day has gotten me through the most difficult times here."
16,"TEXT_FESPDY2020LETTER_00670_LETTERD00670_000_027","(-Letter to Ul'dah's Top Songstresses-)It taught me to always have a song in my heart and a rhythm in my step, and when I grow up I want to be just like you! I know I have a lot to learn, and I would treat any advice you could offer as preciously as a ponze of gold. "
17,"TEXT_FESPDY2020LETTER_00670_LETTERE00670_000_028","(-Letter to the Greatest Aesthetician in the Realm-)I just can't stop playing with my hair. I usually style it differently every day, and I love coming up with all sorts of ways to fashion my friends' hair too. Everyone says I should become an aesthetician when I get older, and I couldn't agree more!"

I know that can never happen, but I'd still like to meet a dragon. The smaller the better, since the big ones look so scary."

22,"TEXT_FESPDY2020LETTER_00670_LETTERG00670_000_033","(-Letter to the Realm's Richest Person-)There's just one thing stopping me from pursuing my dream: I don't know how to make money. So I thought, who better to ask than someone who already has lots of it? I just need one or two hints to get me started and I'm sure before long I'll be swimming in gil."
