6,"TEXT_REGNOR4EULMORE2_00609_NUNSILUE_000_010","Oh, I've lived here for ages. Ten years, at least. It was my mother who brought me─though she's dead now, of course."

8,"TEXT_REGNOR4EULMORE2_00609_NUNSILUE_000_012","I know I'll never get up there, to Eulmore proper. I'll live here, stealing their scraps, and then I'll die here. That's all."

I'll be shocked if that includes ours─if you can even call this heap of junk a “settlement”─but stranger things've happened lately."
