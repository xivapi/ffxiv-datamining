5,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_MINSTREL_NOCONTENT_000","...Or rather I would, though I doubt any of your latest exploits will suffice. Not to belittle them, but what I seek are stories of only the greatest and grandest battles. Even the most skilled minstrel will struggle to entertain an audience with tales of everyday do-goodery."

Four treasures did free the king from torment evermore...♪"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_007","I can only imagine the horror that must have gripped Titania in the moments before the transformation was complete. Knowing that the very people you had sworn to protect would soon suffer and die by your hand..."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_008","It is an all-too-familiar tale to those of us who have struggled to survive in the wake of the Flood. We can but hope that the night's return is of comfort to their soul, should some aspect of it endure."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_009","With the passing of the Light, the fae now dance beneath starlit skies. Where before they mourned, they now rejoice. You made this possible, my friend."

17,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_051","The benevolent savior who would lord over paradise itself. The only ruler fit for a stagnant monument to hedonistic excess─Lord Vauthry. But of course he would claim the title of Innocence for himself in the end."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_052","I cannot speak to whether or not he was a monster as a child, but I can sing of his monstrous deeds and what became of him as a man."

22,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_056","He wouldn't be the first to cloak himself in the trappings of righteousness. They are too common by half, some might even say. Nevertheless, I hope his example serves as a reminder of what evil men may do in the name of so-called good."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_057","You and yours did well to lay him low. No doubt you will confront other villains in the days ahead─and I should be most eager to hear your full account after."

25,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_061","The very man who flooded this world in Light, that its extinction might bring about the Rejoining he sought... An Ascian who lived a thousand thousand lives in pursuit of this single-minded goal until he fell...at your hand."
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_062","There is a part of me that cannot help but feel that it is not my place to tell this man's story. To sing of the ambitions that spurred him to wreak such wanton destruction, and those that compelled you to see that his dream would die in vain."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_063","And yet, if you will permit me a moment's indulgence and a measure of poetic license, I would grace your ears with a tune. I call it, “Requiem for a Hero.”"

31,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_067","I must say, I find it quite fascinating how this Emet-Selch chose to reveal his true name on the verge of the battle that would prove to be his downfall. I am reminded that the Night's Blessed have a similar tradition, in which they conceal their true names outside of rare occasions, such as funerals..."
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_068","What significance might the act of announcing his true name have carried for him? A matter to ponder, perhaps, should you wish to fully grasp the nature of your foe─of the shadow to your light..."

43,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_080","Yet in spite of the pain that love inflicts, man can stop seeking it out no more than he can choose to stop breathing."
44,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_081","Nay, he will never cease to struggle to find love. No matter the weight of sorrow and regret he bears, the yearning and desire drives him on."
45,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_082","For love is the greatest emotion of all. It is a veritable force of nature, transcending reason as it moves us to action. Causing old wounds to tear open anew, again, and again, and again..."
46,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_083","Yet by the same token, it makes the love at which we finally arrive all the sweeter. And we should savor it, and let nothing diminish the joy it brings."
47,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_084","Even should you taste bitter defeat, the sorrow you feel is testament to the strength of your passion. The flame that burns silently within you, perceivable only to you and you alone."

52,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_089","Haha, such are the words of a minstrel, my friend. They must be somewhat open to interpretation, that the listener is allowed to find <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> own meaning."
53,"TEXT_CTSOPN50WANDERINGMINSTREL_00623_PARALLELMINSTREL_000_090","But I digress. We were speaking about the battle between the Warrior of Light and the Warrior of Darkness...and such a battle it was! An exemplary subject for song!"
