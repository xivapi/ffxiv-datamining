27,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_010","When we first discovered it at Azys Lla, it was in a far worse state than it is now. Different color, too. As for its intended purpose, we believe it was developed to combat primals or similar threats."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_011","All of the parts deemed unnecessary have been removed, and we've made several adjustments to improve stability and overall safety."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_012","As a result, however, we had to limit its capabilities to some degree. We can't afford to repeat the mistakes made by the Garleans with the Ultima Weapon, who we believe employed knowledge obtained from the Ascians. After all, we know how that ended."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_013","You might also be relieved to hear that Master Garlond has introduced a pilot recognition system, so that only those given prior permission by the Ironworks can operate it. Think of it as a precaution should the enemy get any ideas about stealing it from us."
31,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_020","The two sensors on the front of the head work in much the same way as the eyes of living creatures, sending visual information to the pilot."
32,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_021","This hornlike protrusion was one of several additions we made ourselves. It's for picking up linkpearl signals, not for ramming the enemy. Still, if push comes to shove, I daresay it could be used to make a last-ditch attack."
33,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_030","Compared to the original design, the outward appearance is largely the same, but we've carried out a number of improvements."
34,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_031","The manipulators─or hands, you might call them─were originally created to claw at the enemy. We've modified them to allow the use of various weapons, such as the aetherial saber."
35,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_040","Ah! I'm glad you noticed! The boosters were built entirely by the Ironworks to allow for low-altitude flight and increased maneuverability."
36,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_041","They're currently unsuited to being used over long distances, hence the need to have the G-Warrior transported by airship. This is another area we're hoping to improve in future iterations."
37,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_Q3_000_000","Done enough posing?"
38,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_050","Ah, yes. The G-Savior. You would be forgiven for thinking that it is simply the G-Warrior with an enormous, table-like object attached to its back, but there is so much more to it than that!"
39,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_051","Its increased size allows for a plethora of additional armaments and so forth, which I'm sure you will agree was worth the massive reduction in maneuverability. It also gave us room to store more fuel, which enables it to travel over much greater distances."
40,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_052","We were concerned at first that Gaius might find it rather difficult to handle, but his experience in piloting the Ultima Weapon─with which the G-Savior shares many similarities─meant he was able to master the controls in no time at all."
41,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_060","This device was specifically designed for capturing the Diamond Weapon. I must say, it was an incredible display of foresight on our part, considering we'd already built the machine before we even knew we'd need it."
42,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_061","Starting with a volley of missiles to subdue the target, the G-Savior then moves close enough to capture it with the containment field."
43,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_062","If it tries to resist, we can deploy a small detachment of troops to beat the target into submission. Of course, the whole thing will be racing through the sky at high altitude, so it might be a little difficult to maintain one's balance...or breathe, for that matter."
44,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_063","We even added a pair of melee weapons, should the opportunity arise for a bit of midair fisticuffs. Unfortunately, the Diamond Weapon refused to hover in front of the G-Savior long enough for us to drill it in the face."
45,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_064","And speaking of racing through the sky, I understand the Anti-G armament proved a valuable asset in your last battle. A shame we had no clue it had been installed. The president was none too pleased to hear <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>, let me tell you..."
46,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_070","As you can imagine, to get such an enormous machine airborne requires considerable feats of engineering."
47,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_071","We initially experimented with designs similar to those of the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>, but we were unable to generate enough lift."
48,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_072","Fortunately, Avilina's knowledge of the propulsion engines used in Garlean airships proved to be the deciding factor. Without her, we would never have gotten the G-Savior off the ground."
49,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_080","Due to its Allagan origin, we've struggled to locate replacement parts for the G-Warrior."
50,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_081","We ended up turning to an expert in such relics, who managed not only to create perfect replicas of the required components, but even produced enough to build a second G-Warrior."
51,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_082","It then underwent the same conversion process as the original model, resulting in the G-Savior Mark II. But rather than use the familiar color scheme of Garlond Ironworks, the creator opted for something more closely aligned with his personal tastes..."
52,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_083","I feared the worst when Procopius made off with it, so I'm very much relieved to see the Mark II returned─though it admittedly has a few more scrapes than I'd like."
53,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_090","The primary function of the G-Savior Mark II is to increase the strength of the containment field by combining its generator with that of the original unit."
54,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_100","As the design is based on the original unit, it offers the same amount of propulsion. The only trouble with using both G-Saviors at once is that we end up burning through twice the amount of fuel. If you were wondering why we don't deploy them more often, you need only look at the running costs..."
