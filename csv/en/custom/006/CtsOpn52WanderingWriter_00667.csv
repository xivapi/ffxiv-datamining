Though I suppose that's only right, considering I followed you. My well of inspiration has run dry, you see, and it is my hope that a change of scenery might offer the impetus my work requires."
2,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_000_001","And time again you have proven a knack for finding fascinating locales, with equally fascinating stories unfolding soon after. "
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_100_000","When such a tale finally <Emphasis>does</Emphasis> unfold, I should very much like to hear it. "

10,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_000","Battle fought in the mind of a dear companion? How thrilling, how compelling! Please, tell me more."
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_001","A specter of the late Emperor Varis. I suppose even a figment of one's memory, assuming sufficient creative liberties are taken, can prove as fearsome as a man of flesh and blood."
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_002","Admittedly, I cannot claim to have witnessed his prowess firsthand, but who has not heard tales of his savagery, his unparalleled might?"
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_003","Yes, I do believe inspiration has struck, my friend. The brutal battle of words which proceeded a nightmarish clash 'twixt the Emperor and the realm's great liberator."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_004","“You would dare approach me thus?” Lord Varis scoffed. “Where men of greater strength and mind both would flee, you dare commit to such folly?”"
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_005","To which the liberator coolly replied, “How else am I to smite thee save...erm...approaching...”"
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_006","An admirable attempt, if I were still learning my letters perhaps. It seems my prose yet wants for inspiration."
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_007","Might you humor me with a more detailed account of your confrontation? I require a more vivid picture if I am to do justice to your deeds."

19,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_000","Gunnhildr's Blades were possessed of not one but myriad weapons with which they saved their queen. Oh, to see the look on the Resistance soldiers' faces when Gerolt's work is complete."
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_001","Wait. Save the Queen? Why do those words sound so familiar... Yes, of course! Queen Gunnhildr was said to wield a holy blade bearing that name. A rather nonsensical moniker, if I may be so bold, but perhaps in ancient tongues it held some sense of grandeur."
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_002","That Bozjans still speak of her reign with such reverence is testament to their storytelling traditions. Traditions which may very well serve to rekindle the flames of this playwright's spirit."
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_003","Which is to say, there is little I know of the blade save for its name.

23,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_010","Ah, yes. The legendary blade, Save the Queen. I happened upon a most fascinating book on its history not long ago."
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_011","It is said this blade, blessed by the gods, could only be wielded by she who would become queen of Bozja. As such, it was passed down through the ages, along with the title of Queen Gunnhildr, serving as undeniable proof of her sovereignty."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_012","A passage I'm certain you have heard repeated ad nauseam. What I read next, however, was a captivating account of how the queen single-handedly saved her people from certain destruction. "
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_013","The Fourth Umbral Calamity had come in the form of a great and terrible earthquake. The Allagan Empire quickly met its destruction, the earth rising up to swallow it whole. Alas, the destruction would not end with the fall of a single nation."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_014","The lands were ablaze with flame, the heavens marred with hues of bloody crimson. Death had come for the people of Bozja, and indeed would claim most as they fled to sanctuary within the castle."
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_015","All hope seemed lost... It was then Queen Gunnhildr proclaimed that, if what remained of their home would be saved, the full might of Save the Queen must be brought to bear. A proclamation met with inconsolable tears and lamentations, for her people understood the meaning in it."
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_016","Taking her blade firmly in hand, the queen quickly thrust it into her breast. Queen Gunnhildr was no more, but in her place stood a goddess, for Save the Queen had taken her body as its vessel."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_017","Her first and final act was to expend every onze of her strength to erect a barrier surrounding what few survivors of Bozja remained."
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_018","The magick held true, but when the barrier fell, naught remained but lifeless, desolate landscape. Their only solace being the threat of the Fourth Umbral Calamity had passed."
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_019","In time, the land would heal. Green found its way back to the soil, rainwater replenishing streams and rivers. Life soon followed."
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_020","All that remained of Bozja was the castle, battered yet unbroken. A monument to Queen Gunnhildr's sacrifice."
34,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_021","Thus ended the reign of Queen Gunnhildr. Though she and her holy blade were no more, they would live on in the memory of her people."
35,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_022","Touching, is it not? A tale fit for the stage if I ever heard one. Would that I had the time to pen works worthy of her legacy."
