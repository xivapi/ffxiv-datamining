5,"TEXT_REGISB5TERTIUM_00753_DECIMUS_000_004","The Final Days your comrades speak of have been averted, and we yet live. Even now, the words of Lord Quintus serve as our inspiration, as we march into a new era. But tell me, is there aught you wish to know?"

10,"TEXT_REGISB5TERTIUM_00753_DECIMUS_000_100","I am Decimus, centurion of the Ist Legion. It is my sworn duty to defend Garlemald from barbarians such as you, and your very presence here is an affront to my honor."

12,"TEXT_REGISB5TERTIUM_00753_DECIMUS_000_102","I am Decimus, centurion of the Ist Legion. Or at least, I was. With the Empire fallen and our glorious capital in ruins, what meaning have such appellations? Even so, I remain a Garlean and I require neither rank nor station to defend my people."
13,"TEXT_REGISB5TERTIUM_00753_DECIMUS_000_200","This is Tertium, third among the stations that encircle the city. The decommissioned carriages here now serve as the Ist Legion's temporary base of operations."
14,"TEXT_REGISB5TERTIUM_00753_DECIMUS_000_201","It has also become a safe haven for those fleeing the turmoil that has befallen the capital. What scant supplies we have are distributed among civilian and soldier alike, and we strive to maintain some semblance of order in these dark times."
