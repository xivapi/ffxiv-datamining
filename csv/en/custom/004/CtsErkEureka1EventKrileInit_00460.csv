1,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_001","Aye. I hate to admit it, but you had the right of it..."
2,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_002","I said I would tell you everything if my suspicions proved true, and so I will. The reason I urged the Scions to approve my participation in this expedition..."
3,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_003","Is because this island...is the Isle of Val."
4,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_100_003","The selfsame island that once served as the headquarters and home of the Students of Baldesion. An island that belongs on the other side of the world, that was obliterated by a terrible magick..."
5,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_004","I was fortunate to have been elsewhere at the time, but I know you were not so lucky. I don't suppose you have any idea how it could have ended up here in the Glass Ocean?"
6,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_005","Alas, my memories of the incident are muddled. All I recall is a voice─that of the star, I suspect. Faint and fleeting, but warm...and then I awoke on the shore of Old Sharlayan."
7,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_006","How convenient for you and utterly unhelpful for the rest of us. Would that more than Galuf's chosen heir could have received this “blessing” of Light."
8,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_007","And where are you off to now, Ejika?"
9,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_008","To find anyone else that might still be alive. I'll thank you not to follow─I work better alone."
10,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
11,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_A1_000_001","Cutting us loose now that you got what you wanted?"
12,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_A1_000_002","It'd be better for everyone if we cooperated."
13,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_009","...Hmph. I'll allow that I've yet to repay you for bringing me to this island. Let no one here say I am ungrateful─I heard it enough from Galuf..."
14,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_010","...Hmph. I suppose you are not without your uses, given your proven capacity for survival. And violence."
15,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_011","A proposal, then. Should I learn anything of significance, I will return here and share it with the rest of you. Does that satisfy, Krile?"
16,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_012","He's a handful, I know..."
17,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_100_012","You needn't worry about me. I am more than capable of defending myself."
18,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_013","So─we have a mystery on our hands. Somehow the Isle of Val was transported from one corner of the world to this one."
19,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_014","Ejika is right in that our first priority should be to confirm whether or not any of our comrades that were here are still alive. If someone is, then perhaps they will be able to help us understand what happened."
20,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_015","I appreciate your help more than you know."
21,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_016","But before you can begin in earnest, it is important that you are properly prepared. The stories you heard about the creatures that roam these lands were not exaggerations, and I would not see you struck down due to carelessness."
22,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_017","Gerolt has been working on something that will be of use to you. Why don't you go and see if it is ready?"
23,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_018","I have various measurements to take in the meantime. Come and find me if you wish to speak later!"
