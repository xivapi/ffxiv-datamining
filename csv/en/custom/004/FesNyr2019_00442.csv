Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Nald'thal, overseer of the underworld and god of commerce who has been charged with this duty."

But you needn't take my word for it─the mochi daikan is overseeing the mochi pounding as we speak, and would be more than happy to give you a demonstration."
