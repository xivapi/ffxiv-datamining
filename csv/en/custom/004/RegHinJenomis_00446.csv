10,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_A1_000_010","Nothing."
11,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_010","As I mentioned, Ramza does not appear in the legend of Delita's miraculous rise to power. For his part in the tale, we must look to the Durai Papers."
12,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_011","My ancestor's account states that Ramza was the youngest son of one Barbaneth Beoulve, the lord of a noble house of high standing. He was the same age as Delita, whom Lord Beoulve took in following the death of his parents. The two boys would have grown up together, side by side. Yet while the legends are strewn with references to Barbaneth's elder sons, his youngest is conspicuously absent."
13,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_012","According to the Durai Papers, this is because the Church of Glabados branded Ramza a heretic, and had his name erased from the annals of history."
14,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_013","My research has yet to reveal why the church would do such a thing, and why his own blood would seemingly condone the act."
15,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_014","For what it is worth, however, the author of the Durai Papers was firmly convinced that Ramza was the true hero of the legend of Ivalice─a true Zodiac Brave."
16,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_020","Delita was born into a family of serfs─the Heirals─who tilled land owned by House Beoulve. When Delita's parents succumbed to the Black Death, Ramza's father took the boy and his younger sister Tietra into his home and raised them as he would his own children. It is at this time that I believe Delita and Ramza became friends, growing up as equals unbound by societal constraints of blood and birth."
17,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_021","According to legend, Lord Barbaneth was quick to recognize that young Delita's talents extended beyond working the land, and so he used his influence to secure the orphan a place at the Gariland Royal Military Akademy. If the Durai Papers are correct about Ramza's age, it would not be unreasonable to assume that he attended the same institution."
18,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_022","The pair would not walk the same path for long, however. Following the untimely death of Tietra─the culmination of a tragic sequence of events set in motion by none other than Ramza himself─Delita cut ties with the house to which he had been bound since birth, and pursued his ambitions alone."
19,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_030","Though they are virtually synonymous with Ivalice, little is actually known of the Braves and their origins. Legend has it that Delita, acting at the behest of the Church of Glabados, set out with a company of knights to recover the twelve lost Zodiac Stones. This they duly did, earning themselves the moniker of Zodiac Braves."
20,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_031","As you might expect, however, the Durai Papers tell a different story. Orran claims that it was not Delita who led the knights, but Ramza Beoulve."
21,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_032","How this discrepancy arose is yet a mystery, but one I fully intend to solve."
22,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_040","Legend paints them as holy relics created by the very gods of Ivalice themselves. Instinct and better judgment suggest they are similar to the aether-based crystals of the present day...but exactly <Emphasis>how</Emphasis> similar is something I will require more time to establish."
23,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_041","One thing both legend and the Durai Papers agree upon is that auracite had the power to make manifest one's deepest desires─be they fair or foul."
24,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_042","This is borne out by the fact that the stones are credited both with destroying Mullonde, city of the gods, and granting Delita the power to bring order to chaos in his kingdom. Auracite, I conclude, is precisely as good or evil as its wielder."
25,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_050","Ivalician legend portrays them simply as demons, but I have a theory as to their true nature based on my own observations...and, of course, those of my honored forebear."
26,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_051","The Durai Papers tell us that when an auracite is used with malign intent, it warps both body and mind, transforming the wielder at last into...something no longer of this world."
27,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_052","These beings... These “others” are, I believe, one and the same as the twisted creatures you faced in Rabanastre."
28,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_053","Defeating said monstrosities served to restore the auracite to its original crystalline state─that of the Duma─which, again, is consistent with events described in my ancestor's records."
29,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_060","According to legend, Argath Thadalfus─or Algus Sadalfus, depending on which version of the tale your nursemaid told you─was once heir to a high house which had fallen into disrepute through the ignoble conduct of its then lord, Argath's grandsire."
30,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_061","Cursing his family's diminished circumstances, the youth turned his ire upon the only souls over whom he still retained any influence: the smallfolk. But Delita, hero of the common man, would not suffer this, and after trying and failing to reason with Argath, put him to the sword."
31,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_062","The Durai Papers, however, tell us more. They make mention of an heirloom passed down from generation to generation in House Thadalfus: a priceless jewel known as the Duma."
32,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_063","Upon Argath's death at the hands of Delita, the power of the Duma─which the young Thadalfus carried upon his person─was unlocked, and the Lucavi bound to it released. The stone duly gave form to Argath's fury, reanimating his body, and granting him the strength to exact revenge upon the one who ended his life."
33,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_064","Yet who should spare Delita that fate but Ramza, who battled the vengeful corpse unbeknownst to his childhood friend, and finally brought peace to Argath's soul...though we know better."
34,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_065","Now you may ask why Ramza would lend his blade to the selfsame man who forsook his ties to House Beoulve. The reason lies in poor Ramza's own involvement in the murder of Delita's sister. It was Argath who fired the bolt that struck Tietra down, aye...but it was Ramza's earlier rescue of Argath that paved the way for the tragedy to follow."
35,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_066","Though Argath was dead, and Tietra avenged, Delita's bitterness endured and festered, and it was not long before he began to blame Ramza. Ramza, for his part, understood all too well the turmoil in his grieving friend's heart, and therefore chose, out of respect, to maintain his distance."
36,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_067","So, the question before us remains how and why a man twice consigned to the grave could rise again to wreak chaos...and in Rabanastre of all places."
37,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_068","Did unscattered remnants of Argath's undying rage trigger a second reaction in the Duma, calling the Lucavi once more to our realm? Or was it something else? Something more...sinister?"
38,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_100","I shudder to recall the horror that befell Ba'Gamnan. Witnessing one of such strong convictions succumb to the lure of the auracite was more than enough to convince me that the artifacts are too dangerous to remain in our hands."
39,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_101","Once my quest is at an end, I shall entrust the stones to the Knowing Circle in Sharlayan that they may find them a suitable resting place."

41,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
42,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_A2_000_000","What is the Clockwork City of Goug?"

47,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_110","Ivalician legend tells of Goug─a city forged from iron and brass, and teeming with fantastical creations, from steam-powered airships to machinoservitors. The people who populated this “modren” metropolis were not unlike us Garleans, in that it was their lack of magical aptitude which spurred them to embrace technology."
48,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_111","While the Durai Papers mention little of Goug's location, there are passages as to its queer construction. “There being no land to claim, her architects instead claimed the sky.” This particular verse, along with some few others, suggests that the city was built up, rather than out, into something resembling a massive tower."
49,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_112","Further mention of Goug comes in the description of an explosion of unknown origin that, if the papers are to be believed, brought down more than half of the city and resulted in its eventual abandonment."
50,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_113","However, examination of heretofore untranslated portions of the document reveal details of a battle waged in the upper halls of the Clockwork City betwixt an automaton known as Construct 6 and our very own Ramza Beoulve. It was during this conflict that errant discharge from the former's weapons rent the city asunder."
51,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_114","It is my belief that this event permanently disrupted the local aetheric flow, ultimately creating the extra-planal fissure into which the Ridorana Cataract now pours."
52,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_115","The presence of such a fissure would have made rebuilding impossible, forcing the people of Goug to renounce their ancestral home and depart in search of another."
53,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_116","I would like to think they traveled north and west to Ilsabard, settling in the land that would one day become Garlemald, yet while traits such as an affinity for machina and a lack of magical prowess align, I must admit, my theory is still mostly conjecture."
54,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_120","As to its origins in mythology, your guess is as good as mine. However, it seems safe to assume that the creature you encountered─most certainly a Lucavi─was a construct of the Duma, born both of Ba'Gamnan's self-loathing and his desire for revenge."
55,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_121","Before the fall of Nalbina Fortress, Ba'Gamnan was a fusilier captain charged with protecting the crown prince and princess. When the royal twins perished, the proud Bangaa blamed himself for their deaths."
56,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_122","You said that when you confronted him on Ridorana, he believed you to be imperial soldiers. I suspect this was a manifestation of Ba'Gamnan's fears projected upon those nearby him by the Duma in an attempt to send the Bangaa into a rage, making him more amenable to transformation─a ruse which ultimately succeeded."
57,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_123","While much of this coincides with what befell Argath in the ruins of Lesalia, there is one important thing we have learned from our second bout with the Lucavi: that no obvious correlation appears to exist 'twixt the auracite catalyst and the resulting beast."
58,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_124","This would imply that it is the subject that determines which Lucavi manifests, and that the Duma merely facilitates the process. What we cannot be certain of, however, is if the subject must ultimately make the transformation of its own volition. We know Ba'Gamnan desired the Duma's power to see revenge exacted...but did he foresee the relinquishing of both body and mind to achieve this end?"
59,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_130","Tia was the love of my life...though ours was not love at first sight. We met through the theater─she a young actress, me a struggling playwright. It was during our work together that we slowly succumbed to the tug of fate."
60,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_131","As the summers passed, we grew closer, and our relationship soon extended beyond the professional. When I learned she was with child, I did not hesitate to ask her hand in marriage. The life growing within her would only serve to strengthen our bonds, to see us realize our dreams."
61,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_132","And while the birth of both Ramza and Alma would do just that, the strength of our love served little to stay the inexorable march of time─time that by some cruel twist of fate was not afforded my wife. The coughing fits came quickly and without warning, sapping her of vigor, and leaving her a pale reflection of the woman she once was. With her last breath, she bade me see that our children never came to harm...a duty I fear I have neglected of late."
62,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_133","There is nothing I would not do─nothing─if it meant spending even a single moment again with my beloved.

64,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_150","Until the revelation dealt us by our moogle guests, the necklace was but a necklace─a reminder to my family of one taken too soon."
65,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_151","It was a wedding gift I found for Tia while on a sojourn to Rabanastre seventeen summers past."
66,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_152","Having long been eager to explore the city, I convinced her to make the journey with me, despite the obvious danger in visiting the embattled territory."
67,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_153","And what a beautiful city it was. <sigh> History will never forgive my people for the crime of its destruction. But to my tale..."
68,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_154","It was in one of Rabanastre's labyrinthine markets that I purchased the necklace. An imperial chapman was peddling what he claimed were local treasures, though I did not press him on how he came by the piece. It was not even particularly expensive."
69,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_155","So you can imagine my astonishment when I learned from Bwagi that we have been in possession of a royal heirloom all this time. To think the necklace was once the property of Prince Rasler, last of the B'nargin line..."
70,"TEXT_REGHINJENOMIS_00446_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_156","Yet this revelation has only left us with more questions, the most obvious being, for what purpose was a larger auracite split into two pieces and set─or mayhap <Emphasis>hidden</Emphasis>─in regalia? I pray the Durai Papers will provide us with an answer."
