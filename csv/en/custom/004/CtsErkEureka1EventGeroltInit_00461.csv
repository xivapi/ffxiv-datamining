0,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_100_000","Not now, dammit, not now! I've been workin' day an' night on this bloody contraption, an' I'm this close to gettin' it right..."
1,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_000","Ah, I remember you. The famed adventurer, aye? Don't tell me─the harridan's holdin' a debt over yer head like me, ain't she? That how she got ye to sign on to this expedition to the arse end of nowhere?"
2,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_001","Got ourselves dragged into a fine mess, aye? Rowena's still wieldin' that tavern debt of mine like a chef's knife, takin' a ponze of flesh here an' there... Wait─don't tell me she got her hooks in you too?"
3,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_002","Ah, well, it's no business of mine. We're here, an' we may as well make the most of it─much as ye can make of bein' stuck on a godsforsaken island where the very elements are yer enemy, an' the only livin' creatures want nothin' more than to make ye dead..."
4,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_003","Ye've probably heard from the others about how the beasties here've been bathed in the twisted aether of this place an' are somehow stronger for it."
5,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_004","Dunno about all that, but I do know that if ye walked out the gates an' let one take a swing at ye, ye'd feel it in more ways than one. Aye, not only can they rend flesh an' break bones, but they can also disrupt yer very aether."
6,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_005","So if yer intendin' to go toe-to-toe with one, ye'll need a way to improve yer ability to endure said beastie's attacks─rather, yer ability to defend against attacks of a given elemental aspect. Goes without sayin' the same principle applies if ye want to hit the beasties back harder, aye?"
7,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_006","Anyroad, to that end, Krile an' I've been workin' on a solution─a magicked contraption ye can use to manipulate yer elemental affinities an' fight more effectively in Eureka. We call it a magia board!"
8,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_007","Might take some gettin' used to, but I'm sure a clever <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If> like you will manage. But the board alone's not enough, I should say. Ye'll need these crystals...err...what were they called...?"
9,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_008","Magicite, that was it. Type of crystal found here in Eureka, pure as driven snow, or so I'm told."
10,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_009","Lucky for you I've got one to spare─brought back by a survivor of the first expedition. Go on an' take it, along with the board."
11,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_010","Reckoned ye'll find more while yer out and about, so I designed it to take up to five in a given configuration."
12,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_011","To affix or remove magicite, ye'll need to avail yerself of that there magia melder. Shouldn't be too hard, but if ye've got questions, direct 'em to the expedition engineer over yonder."
13,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_020","In case yer curious, we took inspiration from somethin' called an elemental converter, which I'm told was born from the mind of one Cid Garlond."
14,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTGEROLTINIT_00461_GEROLT_000_021","Man's got a knack for makin' the impossible possible, they say. Craftin' the kind of contraptions that only a genius─or a madman─would ever conceive. I'd wager he's a little of both, but what do I know 'sides how to swing a hammer?"
