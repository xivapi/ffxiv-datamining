7,"TEXT_REGOTH3TAMAMIZU_00408_SUZURI_000_010","I am the village gatekeeper. Everyone tells me I am incredibly strong, and that is why I have been asked to stand guard over the city."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH3TAMAMIZU_00408_SUZURI_000_011","I have, however, long dreamed of becoming a calligraphist. Nothing is more enjoyable than sitting down with a brush and scripting letters. It is only natural I should feel this way. After all, as my name suggests, I am from the “inkstone.”"

Once we acclimate to this world, we are then transferred into the eggs from which we are born. Despite the physical separation, we maintain a certain connection to that which we were."

13,"TEXT_REGOTH3TAMAMIZU_00408_SUZURI_000_023","The stronger our connection, the more we receive from them. A good example of this is the trading we do. The treasures we sell bring us an abundance of money and new friendships."

15,"TEXT_REGOTH3TAMAMIZU_00408_SUZURI_000_026","Naturally we refused, being the peaceable Kojin we are. Instead we've decided to create a new vault here in Tamamizu. One day it will overflow with treasure that even the Red will grow jealous."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH3TAMAMIZU_00408_SUZURI_000_030","You can imagine our dismay when the Red barred us from the treasure vault on the Isle of Zekki; our very livelihood was at stake."
17,"TEXT_REGOTH3TAMAMIZU_00408_SUZURI_000_031","We needn't worry about such things now, though. Not with our own vault full to bursting with treasure as it is. I thank the kami every day for the work you and the Divine Circle have done for us."
