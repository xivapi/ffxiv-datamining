1,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_A1_000_001","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_A1_000_002","What kind of place is this?"
4,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_010","Putter about and try to keep my head down like all the other “Peregrines,” that's what."
6,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_011","That's what some of the Garleans call us Aan. Means “foreigner” or some such. Can you believe that? I'm a foreigner in my own bloody homeland!"
7,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_012","Well, they'll get what's coming to them soon enough. You can't keep kicking a woman while she's down and expect her to just take it. Mark me─a storm of blood approaches."
8,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_015","That's the question, isn't it? Now that we're free, what are we Peregrines─well, former Peregrines, I reckon─what are we to do with ourselves?"

10,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_017","But no longer, aye. We're free at last, and those imperial whoresons're dead or in chains. Who's the little Peregrine now, eh!?"
11,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_020","This here's the Ala Mhigan Quarter. A residential district and the newest bit of the capital. Though don't misunderstand: “new” doesn't mean “good” or anything like that."
12,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_021","The closer you live to the Royal Palace, the more favored you are. So we poor bastards who the Garleans forced to live all the way out here are the lowest of the low. Naught more than chattel in their eyes."
13,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_022","Aye, we Aan are only fit for manual labor in the eyes of the imperials. Poor as dirt and expendable. Who's to mourn if we get crippled or die doing dangerous work, eh?"
14,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_023","But we won't be broken so easily, oh no. We're far stronger and more stubborn than they realize, and when the time comes, there will be a reckoning..."

16,"TEXT_REGGYR3ALAMHIGANQUARTER_00403_AURIOL_000_025","I tell you, though─while we may have won our freedom, there's still plenty of work to be done. Much of it the same backbreaking sort, even. But at least we'll be doing it for ourselves and for Ala Mhigo."
