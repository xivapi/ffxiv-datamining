1,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_A1_000_001","Tell me about yourself."
3,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_A1_000_002","What do you do here?"
4,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_010","I am but a humble fisherman born into this village, like my parents before me and my grandparents before them."
6,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_011","While lately, many people have been leaving Isari in pursuit of riches, no amount of gold could tempt me to abandon my home here."
7,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_012","Sure, I might be poor, but I am happy. There is no better feeling in the world than to step onto a boat in the morning, feel the wind in your hair as you sail, and come back with a big haul of fish."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_020","Nearly all of us here fish for a living, though our specialties vary quite a bit. Some of us catch the smaller fish with rods, while others use harpoons or nets to reel in the big ones. I, myself, use my hands and dive to collect shellfish from the seabed."
9,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_021","As you can imagine, our village was never by any means affluent, but ever since the imperials invaded, we often find ourselves unable to afford even the bare essentials."
10,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_022","I just remain grateful that whatever happens we will always have the sea. Though we have fallen on hard times, thanks to her, our tables and stomachs will never want for food."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_023","If you are not a very good fisher, however, that might be a different story. Without some aptitude, not only will your hauls be meager, but you will also probably find yourself with very few friends."
