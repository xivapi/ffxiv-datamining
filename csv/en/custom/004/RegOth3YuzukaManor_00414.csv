1,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_A1_000_001","What can you tell me about yourself?"
3,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_A1_000_002","What can you tell me about this place?"
4,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_010","Well, as I just said, I am Gyosan the Namazu. I welcome you and others like you to Yuzuka Manor, and act as your guide while you are here."
6,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_011","There is always a lot to explain, especially on a person's first visit. I guess you could say I am the face of this place to the outside world. And of that I am very proud. Very honored, very pleased."
7,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_020","This place is known as Yuzuka Manor. It is the estate of the magistrate who once governed over the surrounding village. Yuzuka was the name of his line."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_021","The Yuzuka clan was unmatched in their skill with firearms. When the Garleans attacked, it was the Yuzuka who led a troop of warriors against them, armed with the firearms of their forges. They fought valiantly. Yes, yes."
9,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_022","In the end, Garlemald prevailed, and the Yuzuka clan fell under their rule. They saw many difficult days. Very hard, very trying. But they never relented. In time, they rose up together with their lord and fought back again. <sigh> Sadly, they lost again, and this time their clan was disbanded."
10,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_023","Now there are none of the Yuzuka left, and we Namazu keep the manor. That is how we spend our days, and that is all there is to tell of that. Yes, yes."
