Fighting's not my forte, but I'll do my best to support you should you find yourself at a loss as to how to proceed."
1,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_010","I heard Miss Krile asked you to search for a confluence of aether near the observatory to the northwest? According to our preliminary surveys, there's a large concentration of wind-aspected aether over there."
2,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_011","In all likelihood it'll be filled with creatures aspected to wind. Be sure to configure your magia board accordingly!"
3,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_012","Oh, and one more thing: we've received reports of a horrible beast that hunts at night. Apparently it's drawn to the scent of blood, so if you're out there after dark, you'll want to quickly patch up any injuries to avoid getting its attention."
4,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_020","How was it? Did you find what you and Miss Krile were looking for? And was my information of any use? I certainly hope it was!"
5,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_030","Miss Krile asked you to search the Orchard, right? The area is replete with water-aspected aether, so you ought to bear that in mind before setting out."
6,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_031","Oh, and so you know, the average aetherial density is a lot lower in the east than it is north of Port Surgate."
7,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_032","Since there seems to be a direct correlation between aetherial density and the nastiness of indigenous wildlife, it might be safer to head into the Orchard from the east instead of going straight north..."
8,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_040","Got back safe and sound, did you? That's great! You really are something else, aren't you? Almost reminds me of the stories I heard about that other adventurer─the hero of the Scions, I think <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> was called?"
9,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_041","Friend of mine in the Immortal Flames, back in Eorzea, told me all about <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. Said <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> led an elite unit of adventurers into the Praetorium and faced down Gaius van Baelsar himself! Be amazing to meet a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> like that, don't you think?"
10,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_050","Bound for the Marge, are you? The area around the waterfall has high concentrations of lightning-aspected aether. You'd best proceed with caution!"
11,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_051","The fastest and simplest way there would be to head straight north, but that would also take you through some of the most dangerous parts of Anemos. But if you think you can handle it, then don't let me stop you!"
12,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_060","Well done! Is it just my imagination, or did you find that one rather quickly? Only person who could've done it faster is probably that hero of the Ala Mhigan Resistance I heard about."
13,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_061","That friend of mine in the Immortal Flames, back in Eorzea, told me all about <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. Said <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> was instrumental to every major victory they had against the Garleans! It'd sure be nice if we had <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> here to lend us a hand, don't you think?"
14,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_070","Apparently we've only got one more magicite to go? And it's somewhere on the other side of the Val River Swale in Uncanny Valley? Our latest measurements of that region indicate a sharp decrease in ice-aspected aether..."
15,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_071","That said, the overall aetheric density is still exceedingly high. Prolonged exposure to these levels would either kill most creatures...or make them incredibly powerful. You know, I'm not sure if we should be sending you out there on your own..."
16,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_080","I can't believe it! You actually made it all the way to Uncanny Valley and back! You're incredible─just like the hero of the Scions and that hero of the Resistance! In fact, the more I think about it, the more I begin to suspect..."
17,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_081","You're just as powerful as those two famous warriors! We really are lucky to have you on board, aren't we?"
18,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_100","We've spent so much time trying to locate those pieces of magicite that we almost overlooked another unusual wave pattern in the aether. It's extremely rare and extremely brief, but it's reoccurring."
19,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_101","Whatever it is, it's somewhere in Newvoid, to the northwest. If you decide to go and investigate, be careful. I've got a bad feeling about it..."
