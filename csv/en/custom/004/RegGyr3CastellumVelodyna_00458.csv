4,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_001","I was stationed here shortly after the castellum was liberated from the Garleans."
6,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_002","Although I was later assigned to the Velodyna Gatekeepers, my role remains much the same."
7,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_010","This was simply called Velodyna bridge before the Garleans arrived. They saw fit to transform it into a base for their supply trains."
8,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_011","Following their departure, it was left to fall into disrepair. That was until Captain Alpa suggested putting it to good use."
9,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_020","We Gatekeepers are dedicated to our work, but unfortunately we are rather lacking in numbers. Eshana is always looking to hire adventurers, if you're interested."
10,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_030","The griffin statues are truly remarkable. I heard that Alpa had a gift for metalwork, but I had no idea she was so artistic."
11,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_040","Those guest rooms have made a world of difference. I'd much rather travelers slept here than become a midnight feast for some ghastly creature."

13,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_051","Naturally, we Gatekeepers are also glad to have experienced chirurgeons on hand."
14,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_060","When I heard we were taking in Qalyana deserters, I was extremely apprehensive. And now they're sleeping under the same roof as the Vira!"
15,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_061","If I were sharing quarters with a former enemy, I would be afraid of waking up with a dagger between my ribs. It seems Captain Alpa and her Vira friends are considerably more trusting than I am, though."
16,"TEXT_REGGYR3CASTELLUMVELODYNA_00458_SLEEPINGCOEURL_000_070","The castellum has certainly changed since the Gatekeepers arrived. Who could have guessed this former Garlean stronghold would become such a lively hub of activity?"
