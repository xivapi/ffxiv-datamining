8,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_020","Several years ago, the Adventurers' Guild formed the Cascadiers to combat an invasion of rampaging Bombards. The Moonfire Faire was first held to attract new members to the cause."
9,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_021","It proved so popular that it has been held annually ever since, whether the Bombards appear or not. It helps spread word of the guild's activities and generate interest among potential new recruits. In charge of the proceedings is the grand chaperone, Haermaga."
10,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_022","He has decided to have members of the Adventurers' Guild demonstrate their courage and physical prowess to faire-goers through a series of challenges in Costa del Sol."

14,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_040","The Eorzean Nimble Warrior course offers adventurers unparalleled challenge and excitement!"
15,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_041","Built under the supervision of Haermaga and with the financial backing of Master Gegeruju, this three-part obstacle course tests the physical limits of those brave enough to face it."
16,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_042","To succeed, challengers will need endurance, dexterity, and nerves of steel─qualities required of an adventurer when exploring monster-infested catacombs and the like. Only in this case, there's no chance of them being horribly killed! Well, almost none."
17,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_043","Naturally, a prize awaits those who overcome this seemingly insurmountable trial. So? Has your interest been piqued?"
18,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_050","To test your skills in the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, register with Beaudefoin, one of our chaperones stationed near the starting point."

20,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_052","In fact, you can complete the course and collect the reward as many times as you like. Just be sure to let Beaudefoin know before starting again from the beginning."
21,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_060","The rules are simple. Make your way to the platform at the end of each of the three sections and present yourself to the chaperone waiting there."
22,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_061","Once they have marked your completion of their section, you may proceed to the next. Make sure you complete the three sections in the correct order, and don't try to skip any!"
23,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_062","It may seem tricky at first, but there's no need to rush. There is no time limit, and the prize is the same regardless of how long it takes you to reach the end."
24,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_063","Don't worry if you take a plunge─simply return to the beginning of that section and try again! You can do this as many times as necessary. Just so you know, the first two sections begin with a ride on a jet of water! Very original, I'm sure you will agree."
25,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_064","There's a lot more I could tell you about the course, but there really is no substitute for experiencing it for yourself, from the thrills through to the spills. Do go out there and give it a try!"
