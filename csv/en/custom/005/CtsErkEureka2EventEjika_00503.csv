6,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA2EVENTEJIKA_00503_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_336","There was a time when the question kept me up at nights. What do they have that I lack? What indispensable, indescribable quality do these esteemed personages possess that sets them apart?"
7,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA2EVENTEJIKA_00503_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_337","This must all seem so very petty to you. Doubtless you will claim that your gift, your Echo, is not at all the blessing the rest of us believe it to be."

10,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA2EVENTEJIKA_00503_A3_000_002","No, it's pretty much a blessing."
