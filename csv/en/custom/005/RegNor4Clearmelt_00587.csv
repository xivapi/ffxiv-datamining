1,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_010","While I am as relieved as any that night has returned to the realm, it has presented difficulties as well. Why, it is all I can do to keep from slipping and falling into the water when making the rounds in the dark. I advise you to watch your footing as well. "

3,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_040","And the endless day has returned. Though it makes it easier for me to watch over the baths, I must say I miss gazing up at the stars in the sky. But enough of my grumblings─what may I do for you today?"

8,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_A1_000_003","Nothing."
9,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_200","I am in charge of watching over the baths and keeping our visitors safe. This involves driving off the occasional fiend, as well as waking up bathers who have fallen asleep in sheer bliss before they manage to drown themselves."
10,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_201","We even get the occasional stray sin eater, and I don't have to tell you they're not here for a relaxing soak. I must remain ever vigilant, that those under my watch are not struck down when they are at their most defenseless."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_210","Though the horrors brought upon us by the Flood of Light have passed, the worries, aches, and pains we face in our daily lives will never fade away entirely. As long as people want for the succor of our waters, I will watch over the springs and keep them safe."
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_400","This is Clearmelt. Before the Flood, it was home to an inn famed throughout the land for the healing properties of its hot springs.

16,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_411","Perhaps one day Clearmelt will once again thrive and flourish as an inn, and welcome weary travelers from all corners of the realm. A man can dream, can he not?"
