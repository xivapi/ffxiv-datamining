1,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_030","Those bastards from Eulmore have finally gone home─and not a moment too soon, I say. Anyhow, what is it you need of me today?"
2,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_040","Are you mad, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>!? Lakeland is under attack by a horde of bleedin' sin eaters, if you haven't noticed! Whatever it is you need, make it brief!"
3,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_050","Well, if it isn't the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of the hour! Don't think I didn't see how bravely you fought to drive back the sin eater horde. If there's anythin' you need of me, just say the word."

10,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_200","I grew up in Kholusia, truth be told. Things were all right at first, then I lost my parents, and suffice to say that orphans aren't treated kindly there. Once I realized it was either get out or starve to death, I got out. Before I knew it, I'd found my way here."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_201","Suffice to say, it was like night and day. Back in Gatetown, people would just as soon kick their neighbor in the face for a few scraps of meol. At the Crystarium, people actually work <Emphasis>together</Emphasis> to improve everyone's lot. Novel thought, eh?"
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_202","I quickly decided that I wanted to be one of those fightin' for the future and the common good, so I signed up to join the guard. It's not an easy life, but I take comfort in knowing that I'm makin' a difference, albeit a small one."

14,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_220","The threat of the sin eaters has passed for the most part...thanks in no small part to you, Warrior of Darkness. Much blood has been shed here, and the scars of this land will not easily heal. But at least we can begin to look forward. You have our gratitude."
15,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_400","The stalwart castle in which we now stand is known as the Ostall Imperative. It was named for one Ser Ostall, a legendary knight famed for giving his life to stave off a horde of sin eaters in the old days."
16,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_401","The tales have it that even when faced with certain defeat, he ordered his men to hold their ground until the last of the refugees in their charge had fled to safety. And fighting strong at the front to the end was Ser Ostall himself."
17,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_402","A century later, those of us stationed here carry on in the spirit of Ser Ostall's last order, defending the Crystarium and all who reside in Lakeland from the sin eaters and any other menaces that would threaten their way of life."
18,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_410","When the sin eaters came, I remembered the old tale. I vowed to fight as our namesake once did, but in the end the foe proved too strong for us alone. We are most fortunate that the silver-haired man and the girl came along when they did."
