1,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_010","I never thought that one day the Warrior of Light would come to see my paddy fields, and yet here you are."
2,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_011","So, may I ask what you think of the place?"

4,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_A1_000_001","Seems like as good a location as any."
5,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_A1_000_002","A bit on the bleak side, isn't it?"
6,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_012","Yes, I feel it has endless possibilities."
7,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_100_012","Although it may not look like much now, once we have made a few improvements, we should soon see results."
8,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_013","At first, that certainly appears to be the case. Until recently, the soil was covered in rubble, which is why hardly anything grew here."
9,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_014","Once we had gotten rid of the debris, we found the earth below fairly easy to till."
10,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_015","I have also heard that before houses were built on this land, it was actually used for growing rice."
11,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_016","It would give me a huge sense of satisfaction if the area were to come full circle and produce crops once more."
12,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_017","The area is well suited to farming. Water naturally drains out of the fields and into the river without much intervention on our part. However, we must occasionally bring in fresh soil to replenish the nutrients."
13,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_018","Of course, even earth of the highest quality will be of little value until we get more water flowing into the fields."
14,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_019","Relying purely on the streams flowing down from the mountains will lead to a poor yield. We could dig a channel leading off from the One River, to bring in some of its mineral-rich silt. Yes, should work."
15,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_020","Oh! I do apologize─ No doubt you have better things to do than listen to my ruminations on paddy field drainage."
16,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_021","My workers and I do not lack for motivation, only for funding and materials. With your support, the people of the enclave will soon be feasting on delicious, homegrown rice!"

19,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_030","Ah, come to see how we are getting on? The new tools have helped us a great deal. We are very grateful."
20,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_031","There is still a lot of work to be done before we can start planting the rice. That reminds me─ I placed an order with Kozakura and the delivery is due any day now."

24,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_035","But may we ask why you require two live dzos? 'Twould be simpler to bring you horns or pelts or meat. Or do you prefer to slaughter them yourselves?"

26,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_037","Well-tilled soil is essential in the cultivation of crops. Ah... Just the thought of eating the first rice ball from our own harvest makes my mouth water."
27,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_038","Rice balls? We remember these fondly. So vivid is the memory I can almost taste it!"
28,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_039","Mitsuba first introduced us to their heavenly goodness. I shall never forget the flavor."
29,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_040","To think that dzos from the Steppe can assist in producing rice makes me very proud."
30,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_RED00527_000_041","Brother, if we were to stay and help, maybe they will share some of the harvest with us!"
31,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_042","Is this some jest? We Buduga live only for battle─ Not for plowing fields and scattering seeds! And what of our aim to secure the firewalker?"
32,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_RED00527_000_043","We owe our lives not only to Mitsuba, but to the whole enclave! They are the ones who nursed us back to health when we were close to death! Surely we should repay this debt before attempting to seize Hien?"
33,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BLUE00527_000_044","If we work these fields, we can observe his comings and goings, and find the right moment."

35,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_045","So that makes it two against one... Loath as I am to admit it, the idea is not entirely without merit."
36,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_046","Ihase, will you allow us to work alongside you? The only payment we ask is a few bales of rice."
37,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_047","We need all the help we can get, and you seem to have a knack for steering dzos in the right direction, which will no doubt prove useful. But I must warn you─the process takes several moons. You will get your share of the harvest once we are done, though."
38,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_048","Then we have an agreement. If it leads to the capture of Hien, there is no hardship we would not bear."
39,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_BROWN00527_000_049","Come to think of it, Ihase, perhaps when this is finished, you should return to the Steppe with us. A man of your stature and obvious strength could make a name for himself."
40,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_050","You want me to join the Buduga? I cannot imagine my wife and children would be very happy about that. Besides, I am much more at home in a paddy field than on a battlefield!"
41,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_SYSTEM_000_051","Work in the Enclave Demesne is proceeding apace. The new workers and beasts of burden will increase productivity and lighten the load for Ihase and his farmers."

43,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTIHASE_00527_IHASE_000_055","I've high hopes for those Buduga. By all accounts, the Steppe is an unforgiving place, and a lifetime there should have prepared them for long days tilling the soil here."
