1,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_001","It's good seeing you again. This year I have been charged with answering any questions faire-goers might have, so if there's anything you want to know, feel free to ask away!"
2,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_002","Gah! It's been a baking hot summer─one that only gets worse by the day. And though it may be too hot to work, it's never too hot to celebrate!

10,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_011","To prevent this untold disaster, the brave men and women of the Adventurers' Guild banded together to form the Cascadiers and eliminate these menacing fiends."
11,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_012","However, they knew victory would be difficult to achieve on their own, and so they held the first ever Moonfire Faire to recruit other adventurers to their cause."
12,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_013","It was a great success, and in the years that followed, the Cascadiers would continue to hold the faire in preparation for the Bombards' return. The voidsent, however, were never seen again, and soon it became merely a tradition kept alive through the efforts of one man─the grand chaperone Haermaga, who saw it as a way of giving people hope."

15,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_020","Half a decade ago, when the Cascadiers fought the Bombard King, what we took to be a victory was but a ruse. Leading us to believe he was dead, the fiend has since been lying in wait, gathering his power, and has now returned to terrorize these lands once more."
16,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_021","But he is mistaken if he thinks we shall be so easily cowed! No matter how many times he returns or how much stronger he grows, the Adventurers' Guild will always be here to send him back!"
17,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_022","Yes, in fact, the Go Go Posing Rangers will see that the Bombard King is defeated once and for all, and the fiend shall sorely regret ever even thinking to infiltrate these lands!"
18,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_023","However, he is not the only menace the Rangers must contend with, for he does not come alone. He has brought his minions with him and there are too many for even our resident heroes to take on without a little help."
19,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_024","We welcome any willing adventurers to support the Posing Rangers in their battle. Should you be interested, you can speak with our guild's stockman to borrow an elbst. A single well-aimed blast of their waters should be enough to extinguish a minion's flames!"
