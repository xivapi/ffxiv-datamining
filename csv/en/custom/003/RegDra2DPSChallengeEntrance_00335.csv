10,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_030","Well, simply put, it's a training ground managed by the Adventurers' Guild. Here, members are free to hone their technique and see if it's up to snuff."
11,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_031","You tell us what sort of trial you'd like to take, and we prepare a striking dummy for you."
12,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_032","Destroy the dummy in the time allotted, and you pass. Don't, and you fail. It's not the most involved assessment, but it works."
13,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_040","That depends on what you want to kill, I suppose?"
14,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_SYSTEM_000_041","Stone, Sky, Sea offers trials tailored to various high-level duties, in which you will be tasked with destroying a striking dummy."
15,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_SYSTEM_000_042","While the strength of the striking dummy may vary significantly depending on the difficulty selected, please note that all trials have a time limit of 3 minutes (Earth time)."
16,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_SYSTEM_000_043","The strength of the striking dummy will also be adjusted depending on your class/job when registering for a trial."
17,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_050","Ah, so you're interested! Why didn't you say so? You need only tell me the trial, and I'll see to the arrangements!"
18,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_SYSTEM_000_051","To undertake a trial in Stone, Sky, Sea, you must not be in a party."

20,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_SYSTEM_000_053","Once summoned to your training ground, you will have a brief period in which to prepare for your trial. However, you may engage the striking dummy and commence your trial early should you choose to do so."

27,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_071","I won't lie─they were desperate times. I even went so far as to try and join the House...I knew Rowena'd made some unconscionable demands of her girls, but when <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> came calling, ye gods..."
28,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_072","Still, if it weren't for the training grounds, I might've considered it. Fortunately, I didn't have to. You won't believe this, but the esteemed gentleman from the guild who thought it up asked for me by name!"
29,"TEXT_REGDRA2DPSCHALLENGEENTRANCE_00335_ONETIMEGUIDE_000_073","Turns out, he was a traveler I ferried to the gates some time ago. Must've done an awfully good job, 'cause he says he wants me to do the same for every adventurer bound for Stone, Sky, Sea. And here I am, hah!"
