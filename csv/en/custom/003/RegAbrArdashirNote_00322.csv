Yet there is something missing from these crude automata─a soul. While the soul is perhaps inimitable, my master and I were working on a way to improve these mindless drones."
12,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_011","(-The Study of Anima-)The soul houses the psyche and makes us who we are. Practitioners of the arcane are able to channel aether from within themselves into soulstones, creating a quasi-soul that can animate golems. The residual imprint of the channeler's psyche, however, robs these beings of individuality."
13,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_012","(-The Study of Anima-)Unable to manipulate our own bodily aether, an infusion of pure aether was the logical choice. The ramifications of this could, in fact, revolutionize automata. Without a residual psyche to hinder their self-awareness, they could think, they could learn─the possibilities are endless!"
14,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_013","(-The Study of Anima-)Our goal was to harness the power of anima─the force used to traverse the Lifestream via aetherytes. Yet try as we might, our experiments bore no fruit. Master deemed the project a failure, and turned to other endeavors. But we were so close, I could not simply give up."
15,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_014","(-The Study of Anima-)My last hope lay with the Sharlayans and their knowledge of arcane sentries, which led me to Eorzea. I came to speak with Mistress Rowena, but also encountered both the realm's most surly drunk and its finest blacksmith. Sadly, they were one and the same."
16,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_015","(-The Study of Anima-)After needlessly berating my plan to base new trials on Sharlayan theory, this Gerolt fellow proposed an ingenious idea: binding the aether-infused soulstone with a weapon in order to preserve the anima. This could not only stop the anima from deteriorating, but give it practical applications as well."
17,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_016","(-The Study of Anima-)This assumes his idea works, of course, but it is too intriguing to dismiss. In a stroke of good fortune, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, a reputable adventurer of this land, has agreed to assist with testing."
18,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_017","(-The Study of Anima-)Enthused by the prospects of this anima weapon, Rowena has arranged to have us work in Azys Lla, the fabled seat of Allagan technology. I wonder how one wields such clout as to make these plans on a whim, but I suppose it does not matter. At long last my master's dream will be a reality."
19,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_020","(-The Anima Weapon-)Gerolt's plan actually worked! The anima now resides in the weapon and its aetheric energies remain stable. It is almost baffling that such a drunkard of a blacksmith achieved what my master and I together could not."

The key to its growth, however, will be the lack of an initial imprint from another psyche. With no such overbearing influence, the anima's growth should be more organic. "
22,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_023","(-The Anima Weapon-)The anima is free to interpret its wielder's will much like a child would its parent's.

24,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_031","(-Awakening the Anima-)Of course it was only natural that I would accompany <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. Having finally succeeded after so many failed attempts, what sort of researcher would I be to let this test go unsupervised?"

If not for my pens and papers, I would have forgotten the purpose of this journey was research. But the lack of activity in the anima was disheartening.

27,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_034","(-Awakening the Anima-)To put it simply, the anima drew on aether in the surrounding environment to create a body separate from the weapon housing the soulstone."

29,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_036","(-Awakening the Anima-)The noises were unintelligible, but I believe it is safe to assume the anima has quickened and is gaining a sense of self-awareness."
30,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_037","(-Awakening the Anima-)The rate of growth is much faster than I anticipated. There is no telling what the anima will be capable of next."
31,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_040","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)The anima has developed quite nicely thus far, exuding an aura that practically bursts from within the weapon. However, I feared at its current pace this would be more than a mere manner of expression."
32,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_041","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)The soulstone serving as its vessel, and the weapon in which it was encased, were not without their limits. Something had to be done to ensure the anima's longevity."
33,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_042","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)Bolstering the soulstone's capacity for aether was not difficult, but the weapon <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> wielded then would not bide the strain."
34,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_043","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)This is why I asked Gerolt to forge a new weapon. Though I sometimes loathe the company of this ale-washed jolthead, his prowess with a blacksmith's hammer is undeniable."
35,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_044","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)His brusqueness was made slightly more tolerable by the look of exasperation that swept across his face upon my request.

36,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_045","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)Gerolt insisted <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> set out and gather several unusual materials for his work.

37,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_046","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)I was tempted to ask, but soon thought better of it. It did not seem fitting to have <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> recount such an obviously taxing journey so soon after returning."
38,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_047","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)Thankfully <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> efforts were not wasted in the slightest.

39,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_048","(-Reforging the Anima Weapon-)I suspect even the anima, with its newly found self-awareness, could appreciate such an elegant form."

42,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_051","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)As an analysis of the anima had yielded no answers thus far, I decided to focus my efforts on investigating <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> past exploits."
43,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_052","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)It was then I discovered that <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> possesses a power known as the Echo.

We had to increase the conductivity of the anima weapon, thereby amplifying the transmission of aether from <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> to the anima."
45,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_054","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)Though Gerolt was confident in his ability to enhance the anima weapon, it was not without risk. Increased conductivity would render the weapon highly sensitive to nearby sources of aetherial energy. As a result, Gerolt could have inadvertently gained some level of attunement with it before completing his work. Unless, of course, his tools could be insulated to prevent said attunement. Much to my surprise, he had a solution."
46,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_055","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)Apparently he developed a technique called <Emphasis>soulglazing</Emphasis> while working on an older weapon commissioned by <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

47,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_056","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)As to be expected, however, he failed to research where exactly this aether oil could be found. Thankfully, no task is too great for <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Through what I can only assume is an advanced network of merchants and brokers, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> procured five bottles of oil."
48,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_057","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)Gerolt's soulglazing worked flawlessly, and the hyperconductive anima weapon pulsed with newfound strength.

49,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_058","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)Gerolt's self-indulgence aside, today was a success. As the anima grows in strength, perhaps the day when I too can look upon it will soon be at hand."
