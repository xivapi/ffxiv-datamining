My ancestors strode into the unknown, that they might commit to parchment the lay of the land and curve of the shores for all mankind."
1,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_000_001","Like all adventurers, you doubtless carry a map of Eorzea, yes? Well that, my friend, is the work of an Ironheart─my grandpapa Roddard, to be precise. His descendants have since followed in his pioneering footsteps, my brother Nedrick and myself included."

4,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_000_012","I have made it a personal quest of mine to see all the wonders our realm has to offer, and would encourage you to do the same. Should you be so inclined, pray return to me when your travels are done. I would like nothing more than to share impressions with a fellow sensitive soul."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_100_012","I see that your explorations have led you to my cousin Kester. Oft he would regale me of the many sights and splendors of Ishgard. Oh, to think that you have journeyed there to gaze upon such wonders with your own eyes!"
6,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_100_013","Kester's notes tend to be terse, and you may find them more difficult to follow than my own. Do not let that discourage you, however─if the vistas he has found are even half as magnificent as his tales make them out to be, it will be more than worth the effort to seek them out."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_100_014","Well now, to think that you have also met Uncle Ulger! There is no hiding his passion for foreign lands and their cultures, and I've no doubt that such sights as he has noted in your log will be well worth the seeking."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_SYSTEM_000_013","From the impressions recorded in your sightseeing log, identify and seek out the locations described. Note that certain sights may only be properly appreciated at a given time of day, or under ideal weather conditions."

11,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_000_021","From the first time we met, I could sense that we shared a certain bond. Why, I would not be surprised if you were a distant relative."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_000_022","If you are anything like me, I suspect the experience has only served to further kindle your wanderlust. Fear not, for your journey has only begun."
13,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_000_023","Would that I could say I had put to paper each and every wonder to be seen in our realm! But no─look closely, and you will notice entries in the log I gave you for which scarcely aught has been written."
14,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_000_024","Many and myriad wonders remain untouched by the eyes of mortals. To seek them out will require courage and sensitivity that few possess─qualities for which you do not lack, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
