1,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_10","The Bombards are fiery fiends who have, in summers past, threatened to turn Eorzea into a living inferno. In addition to your garden-variety creatures, there is also the especially fiery Bombard King. We Cascadiers need all the help we can get if the realm is to be purged of these dread demons!"
2,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_11","What precisely do we require of you, you ask? It would be my pleasure to explain!"
3,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_12","Cascadier cadets have taken to the field on a mission to quell the fury of the Bombard King. Bringing down the creature will require no less than their complete focus, leaving them quite defenseless."
4,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_13","Your task will be to protect the cadets from the attentions of lesser Bombards that would flock to their overlord's aid. Straightforward, yes?"
5,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_14","Now, over the years of fighting Bombards, we have observed that the creatures are drawn to large bombs. So as to help you to perform your duty more efficiently, we have prepared bomb balloons for you to use as bait."
6,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_15","Oh, and one more thing. When slain, a Bombard leaves behind its ash. Any ash you find should be brought to us for proper disposal, else the creature will rise to plague the realm once more."
7,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_16","Of course, we do not ask that you bear this hazardous material without due compensation. Bring us enough pinches of ash, and we will present you with delightful items in exchange!"
8,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_20","Cruising for some pinches of ash, are you? Well then, I'm pleased to inform you that any wet Bombard ash you acquire during Cascadier operations can be exchanged for heat-dispersing gear and other nifty rewards. You need only speak with one of our provisioners to be issued the goods."
9,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_30","<Emphasis>We</Emphasis> are the Cascadiers, an organization formed by the Adventurers' Guild to deal with the Bombard menace. Ours is a storied tradition dating all the way back to the Sixth Astral Era!"
10,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_31","See here, now. All Cascadiers are issued this, a protective garment engineered to optimize heat dispersion. Should you see people outfitted as I am, you may safely assume that they are of our number. Thus clad, we have no cause to fear our fervid foe."
11,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_ABUBRIGADE_000_32","The garment may take some getting used to, but you will come to appreciate the practicality of it. Besides, what is a bit of exposed skin compared to the preservation of the realm?"
12,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
13,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_A1_000_1","What is the Bombard menace?"
14,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_A1_000_2","What is wet Bombard ash good for?"
15,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_A1_000_3","Who are the Cascadiers?"
16,"TEXT_FESSUMBOMB2013_00104_A1_000_4","Nothing."
