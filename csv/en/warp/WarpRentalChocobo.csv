0,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_Q1_000_1","What would you like to do?"
1,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_A1_000_1","Rent a chocobo. (80 gil/10 minutes)"
2,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_A1_000_2","Learn more about chocobo rental."
3,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_A1_000_3","Leave."
4,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_1","You must forgive me, but I am afraid my superiors would deem it inappropriate if I granted someone so obviously and painfully new to adventuring leave to take the stable's birds out beyond the city walls without proper supervision."
5,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_SYSTEM_000_2","Chocobos are available for rental upon attaining level 10 in any class."
6,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_10","While it pains me to do so, I must deny your petition to rent a chocobo on account of your present lack of funds. Might I suggest taking up a levequest from the Adventurers' Guild? You are less than a single task away from experiencing the joys of riding chocoback."
7,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_Q2_000_1","The standard chocobo rental fee is 80 gil for 10 minutes. Complete the transaction?"
8,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_A2_000_1","Yes."
9,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_A2_000_2","No."
10,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_20","Feel free to return if you ever require a steed!"
11,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_21","Very good! Remember, my birds are trained to return directly to the stables once the rental period has expired, or upon the moment you dismount. Take care not to find yourself stranded in a dangerous locale. Good day!"

13,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_30","Known for their near-endless stamina, breathtaking speed, and remarkably mild dispositions, chocobos are used throughout the realm for safe and efficient transportation. These stables house hundreds of specially bred and trained birds which we lend out to adventurers─for a nominal fee, of course."
14,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_31","When renting my chocobos, I ask that you follow three simple rules:"
15,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_32","One, do not dismount until you have arrived at your final destination. To prevent theft, my birds are trained to return to these stables the moment you have climbed down out of the saddle."
16,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_33","Two, always keep track of how much time remains on your rental contract. Again, to prevent theft, my birds have been trained to refuse further commands and return to these stables once the agreed time is up."
17,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_34","And three, do make your best effort to keep the chocobo out of harm's way. Ravenous beasts will attack the bird if you enter their territory. If he sustains grievous injury, the poor lad will very likely buck you and do his best to escape."
18,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_35","That is all. So, what say you?"
19,"TEXT_WARPRENTALCHOCOBO_RENTALCHOCOBO_000_40","Greetings! May I interest you in a chocobo? Mine are guaranteed fastest in the realm─or your money back!"
