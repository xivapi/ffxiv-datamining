2,"You find a pile of well-worn blades and shields, though not of imperial design.",7,False
3,"You pick up the research documents and find page after page of meticulous calculations and observational data on Dalamud. Young Cid posits that the lesser moon may very well possess the ability to harness and manipulate solar power.
Moreover, the vast stores of energy it has amassed over the millennia, should they be unleashed, would far exceed any parameters the transmission tower may have been designed to withstand.",4,True

Upon closer inspection, you discover a medical kit.",7,False
18,"The unfortunate soldier was carrying a medical kit.

In this battle, you are unable to use the full extent of your powers. To reach Camp Broken Glass quickly, you should avoid combat whenever possible.
If you are discovered, your foes will give chase. The magitek units are especially powerful, and your chances of defeating them in your current state are slim at best.
You may use medical kits to restore depleted HP. While you can only carry a limited number, more can be found by inspecting fallen soldiers or wrecked magitek.",7,False

Search the area for the pilot.",7,False

31,Resting at the bottom of the pool is an animal carcass overgrown with plant life. Perhaps it fell in while foraging for food.,7,False

36,You find feathers are scattered about the ground. There are signs of a fierce struggle...,7,False
37,The cloying stench of fresh leavings assails your nostrils. Whatever beast left them is likely still close by...,7,False
38,"Row upon row of names are shown on the terminal display. It appears to be a list of those who were recently “taken to the cloud.”
Might Namikka be among them...?",7,False
39,"All instructions in the processing manual must be strictly observed. As we have charge of the realm's most vital resource, actions resulting in damage or loss constitute a serious crime.

First Stage: Extraction
Mixed aether comprised of both memory and soul is extracted from regulators and transferred into the stabilizing tank. As hastening extraction increases the risk of damage, the rate must not be adjusted except in the event of an emergency.",4,True
40,"Priority Observation Subject
Identification number: 161127
Name: Namikka
Physical cessation age: 86
Citizen memory erasure: Completed
Corporeal disposal: Completed
Aether extraction: Completed",4,True
41,"Second Stage: Separation
Mixed aether is put through the aetheric separator and divided into its soul and memory components. Soul aether is then conveyed to upper Origenics for final processing, and memory aether to the Meso Terminal (route and location classified).
Unless expressly specified, the memories of fiends are discarded.",4,True
42,"Third Stage: Purification
Separated souls undergo thorough cleansing for the removal of residual memories. The purifying light is harmful to organic beings, so utmost care must be taken during the procedure.
Even the slightest contamination may lead to memory and personality disorders within the user. As such, each and every soul must be cleared using the precision detector.
Having completed the aforementioned processes, a soul may finally be made available to the people of Alexandria. Your efforts are essential for the functioning of our nation, and we thank you for undertaking your duties with diligence.",4,True
43,"Experiment log 216. Subject: Ambrose
Experiment sees a soulless body infused with multiple souls, including those of beasts, via a prototype multi-regulator.
Subject currently behaves within the parameters of a living person, but displays advanced symptoms of personality breakdown and destructive tendencies. This is all but certainly due to an overdominance of feral souls. Yet while the subject possesses phenomenal strength, it cannot be reliably controlled, rendering it unfit for purpose. Future experiments must focus on imposing loyalty and obedience.",4,True
44,"The polished surface glimmers with myriad symbols, none of which obviously resemble Eorzean script. Although unfamiliar, the patterns you discern imply the glyphs form a written system of some kind. Was this encoding designed to conceal knowledge considered a threat to civilization?",7,False
45,"As you peruse the tablet's inscription, a wave of nausea compels you to avert your gaze. No doubt the document is imbued with some magical contrivance, shielding it from eyes deemed unworthy of the knowledge within.",4,False
46,"Indecipherable tomes are strewn across the floor and piled haphazardly among the fallen shelves. Closer inspection reveals countless magical glyphs, likely representing a wealth of arcane knowledge.",4,False
47,"You come across all sorts of head-scratchers walking the streets of San d'Oria, but none more puzzling than the so-called rivalry between Gallijaux and his brother Joulet.

They're said to be locked in a contest to see who can catch the most carp, yet every day without fail, adventurers show up hauling in barrels of carp on their behalf. Doesn't sound like much of a fishing competition to me, yet no one seems to question it.
Stranger still is the poor compensation offered for these deliveries. You'd fetch a far better price at the auction house, and yet the stream of adventurers to the pier never dries up. Maybe they know something the rest of us don't. Maybe there's a greater prize waiting at the end of it all.",4,True
48,"It feels like little more than an old wives' tale now, but rumor has it a strange, giant creature is known to appear in these parts. There are written reports of sightings in the area, but they're all so wildly different, it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. Some say adventurers swarm the beast and fell it in a flash. Others claim there's no great beast at all—only a grand culling of the local fauna.
The only common thread in every account is that those in attendance have a grand time. A tale more jovial than cautionary, if you ask me.",4,True
49,"Another day, another failed attempt... Would that it didn't cost so many seals.
Still, I suppose “failed” isn't the right word. We did win, after all.
I'll get what I'm after eventually. For now, it's time to head home and clear my head.",4,True
50,"Worms today, crabs tomorrow, and the day after that? Leeches, maybe?
Ugh, but those kisses, and that strength-sapping mist... I *really* can't stand that one.
Maybe it's time for a change of scenery. Rolanberry Fields could be worth a look. Demand on the market's always changing, after all. No reason why our choice of hunting grounds shouldn't either.
Takes a lot of planning, but that's half the fun of being a linkshell master.",4,True
51,"Long, long ago, there was once a great civilization that flourished in the firmament. But their leaders, in pursuit of paradise eternal, dared to trespass upon the forbidden.
This would bring ruin to their civilization, its leaders falling into slumber that would last an age.
Yet we must not forget, their spirits are undying. Even now, they refuse to abandon their dreams of paradise.",4,True
52,"What is Preservation's purpose? The answer to that question is simple: to ensure the survival of mankind. In a world beset by lightning-aspected imbalance, this means securing a place where people may live in safety, as well as establishing a treatment for the levin sickness which plagues us.
Many approaches were considered, but in the end, it was a child─a youth of undeniable genius─who discovered the most brilliant and complete solution to all the challenges we now face.",4,True
53,"According to Master Calyx, it is not the body which provides life to a living being, but the soul. Furthermore, it is the memories etched upon that ephemeral giver of existence which encapsulate one's true self. Based upon these principles, he has proposed a methodology for preserving souls using electrope technology─as souls are composed entirely of aether, he asserts that storage via contemporary means should be eminently possible.
Experiments conducted on criminal subjects and volunteers have, in fact, already proven successful in capturing the aether released at the moment of death. Mankind as we know it has taken a great leap forward.",4,True
54,"We have succeeded in transferring a soul stored within a specialized electrope device into a mechanical soldier, resulting in full control and function. No longer need we fear the erosion which lightning energies inflict upon flesh-and-blood bodies. Yet despite this crucial breakthrough, Master Calyx remains unsatisfied. He would divorce memory from soul, siphoning the soul's aether reserves whilst granting eternal life to the individual's memories. Unfettered to a soul, memories can not only be stored, but also backed up as data─the Endless will be beings of pure information.
His foreshortened lifespan was, perhaps, the very perspective needed to conceive of such a unique evolutionary path.",4,True
