22,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_121","From the moment you enter the manor, you will have thirty minutes to complete three games chosen at random. Should you prove successful, you will earn yourself a special treat!"

24,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_123","Should these ghastly residents discover your presence, they will transform you into a pumpkin! Not permanently, of course. How else would they enjoy hunting you down over and over again!?"
25,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_124","Repeated transformations will take their toll on your sanity, reducing you to a gibbering mess. Once this happens, I'm afraid we'll be forced to evict you in favor of fresh vict─ Er, visitors!"
26,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_SYSTEM_000_125","Haunted Manor participants will be given a sanity meter. Once this value reaches zero, you will be ejected from the instance."
27,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_140","Why, of course! We have an entire troupe of circus members, er, “disguised” as horrifying ahriman and ephemeral wisps. They will be roaming the halls, and casting enchantments on clumsy intruders!"
28,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_141","Unless you wish to spend much of your visit as a pumpkin, you would do well to avoid the ahriman's one-eyed gaze."

42,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_211","Sound simple? And so it would be were it not for the locking enchantment! To dispel this arcane safeguard, one must stand before the coffer and intone the correct combination of five numbers."
43,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_212","But do not despair! There are hints conveniently penned on pieces of parchment...which are scattered inconveniently around the manor."
44,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_213","If you have not the stomach for searching, you might simply guess the numbers. But be prepared for a shock should you utter the wrong combination!"

46,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_SYSTEM_000_215","Entering the correct combination will open the coffer. Entering the wrong sequence, however, will reduce your reserve of sanity points."

50,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_222","You need not step inside the patterns at the exact same moment, but as long as one of the circles is left unoccupied the game will not end!"
51,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_230","In this game, you must use smoldering coals to light the jack-o'-lanterns scattered around the manor."

62,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_261","The only way to find the imp is by collecting and using the truesight smoke bombs! A normal pumpkin will emit red smoke...but the voidsent trickster will be betrayed with blue!"
63,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_262","When you discover the right pumpkin, investigate the chest to force the impostor to reveal itself. Make sure to use the smoke bomb first, or the creature will continue to ignore you!"

65,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_130","Oh, no! No fighting! But there will be plenty of sneaking and hiding! In fact, you might even find a magical charm or two to help you avoid detection by the manor's relentless denizens!"
66,"TEXT_HALLOWEENENTRANCE_MEMBERC01548_000_131","Such charms are fleeting, however, so be sure to make the most of their brief effects!"
