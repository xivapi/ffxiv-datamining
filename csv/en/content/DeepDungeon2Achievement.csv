1,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_010","Helping Rasho and that Kyusei fellow, are you? Once you've finished running their errands─and by that I mean conquered the thirtieth floor─you come and see me. Oh? I suppose you're wondering how I'd know a thing like that. Heh! Your little secret isn't as secret as you thought."
2,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_020","So you've met Hiruko and lived to tell the tale? And you're hungry for more adventures in the tower? In that case, I've a favor to ask."
3,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_021","I'll bet that Rasho and Kyusei never told you, but there are four treasures that only those who have reached the highest level of Heaven–on–High are fit to own. If I could see them all together, it'd mean the world to me."
4,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_022","'Course, I wouldn't ask you to bring them to me out of the goodness of your heart, although you seem like the sort that might. I've got a treasure of my own, see, and it's yours if you show me those baubles. I'll be waiting here. Just don't get yourself killed!"
5,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_030","So you climbed all the way to the top? I guess that makes you more of a warrior than I ever was. Yes, I once tried to scale the tower, but I didn't get as far as you."
6,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_031","Since you managed to reach the pinnacle, you should be able to lay your hands on the four treasures I mentioned. Once you've got them all, come and see me!"
7,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_SYSTEM_000_032","You can exchange empyrean reliquaries for four types of accessories by speaking to the Confederate custodian."
8,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_SYSTEM_000_033","If you speak to the cast-off Confederate with all four of these accessories equipped or in your inventory, you will earn an achievement and a rare item."
9,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_040","What's that you have there? One, two, three, four! All those pretty treasures, but what will you do with this lovely reward I have for you? Unless you plan to jam it where the sun doesn't shine, I suggest you make a bit of space!"
10,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_041","Considering that you climbed to the top of Heaven–on–High, I'd say making room between all those knickknacks of yours shouldn't be too taxing."
11,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_SYSTEM_000_042","To collect your reward, ensure you have sufficient inventory space and speak with the cast-off Confederate once more."
12,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_050","Ah, the treasures, the treasures! I never thought I'd live to see them all together like this. If you keep up these heroic exploits of yours, you might end up surpassing Tenzen himself!"
13,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_051","It seems only fitting that I give you one of these. There are but a few in existence and have been passed down from the time of the first Confederate leader. Think of them as marks of honor."
14,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_052","You see, when the head of the Confederacy relinquishes his seat, he looks after these horns and awaits warriors truly deserving of them."
15,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_053","I hope you don't mind if I tell your tale to any who'll listen. And here's payment for a fine story. You've earned it."
16,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_060","But wait just a moment, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. How can you expect to carry it if you're weighed down like a pack horsebird? Come back when you've lightened your burden!"
17,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_070","Not many people know this, but the great Tenzen is said to have climbed Heaven–on–High."
18,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_071","The strange thing is, even though he reached the very highest level, he never actually brought all four of the treasures together."
19,"TEXT_DEEPDUNGEON2ACHIEVEMENT_DD2FORMERLEADER_000_072","Whether he had to go and slay some foul beasts elsewhere, nobody knows. One thing's for certain, you managed a feat that not even the legendary Tenzen accomplished! You should be proud."
