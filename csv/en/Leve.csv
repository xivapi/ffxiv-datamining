31,A Sword in Hand,"For many Ixal, the weapon of choice is the sword, meaning that training new Wood Wailer recruits on how to use one's spear to defend against the flurry of a short blade is crucial to ensuring their success in combat.

48,Grinding It Out,"A good sharp spear can spell the difference between life and death, so all Wood Wailers are taught early on to tend to their weapons daily. While many of those stationed in the field rely on whetstones carried in their satchels, lancers given assignments in larger outposts employ grinding wheels to give the spearheads a wickedly sharp edge.

53,Armoires of the Rich and Famous,"Furnishings made of high-quality walnut have grown quite popular amongst the rich merchants refurbishing their post-Calamity residences─so popular, in fact, that the Carpenters' Guild cannot keep up with the demand.

Without some small guidance from the Temple Knights, these commoners of the volunteer militia are more likely to injure their comrades than the enemy.

Naturally, she wanted to serve him the finest fish he had ever tasted, but used grass carp in her main course, a fish so bitter it would cause one's face to pucker up as soon as tasted.

Alas, a wounded dragon will lie low for days until the torn membranes heal anew and it recommences its vengeance.

Yet the Holy See backs their demands, so I would entrust the task to another for an ample amount of coin.

1096,An Account of My Boots,"The chief architect of House Dzemael well understands the impermanence of his work. The stone bridge he built in his youth has cracked and eroded in the Calamity's freeze. The village he built as a young man was burned to the ground by dragon breath.

While he took baths with some regularity, the moldy stench which wafted from his robes was so overpowering that he was given his own office out of consideration for his peers. By the grace of the Fury, a flamboyant gesture near a lit candle saw it turned to flame and then soot within seconds, leaving him in his altogether. I would rather him not remain so.

1644,A Historical Flavor,"When Sharlayan was first founded, there was a time when food was hard to come by. According to the history books, the people staved off starvation during this period with the help of traditional northern food─a mildly sour yoghurt.

Figuring out the right meat, vegetables, and everything else required to meet a body's needs is an adventure unto itself─one I hope to simplify greatly.

Unfortunately, the animal's stringy meat leaves something to be desired, but I've theorized that by modifying their diet, their muscles may become tender enough for the most discerning of gourmands.

1654,Beet It,"Is there any vegetable more versatile than the beets native to the northern regions? Packed with nutrients and bursting with flavor, they enhance most every meal. One little known usage of the vegetable, however, is as a dye for other foods. Why settle for tepid browns and unappetizing greys when you can bask in vibrant reds and deep purples?

1659,In Case of Emergency,"The sago palm has rescued the people of Thavnair from the grip of famine more than once. On the other hand, either out of ignorance or desperation, many have succumbed to its poison because they failed to prepare the fruit properly for consumption.

1661,Wood Envy,"I've recently heard of a group of technologists in the Far East who call themselves the Onishishu. It seems their aetheryte─which they call Tenkonto─designs incorporate large amounts of wood, and for the life of me I cannot fathom why.
