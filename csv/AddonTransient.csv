<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Arcana Stones<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  You and your opponent each have three of these immobile crystals on
  the playing field. Shatter all of your enemy's Arcana Stones to claim
  victory.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Gates<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  Minions will appear in front of your currently selected gate.
  Returning minions to a gate area will restore their HP.
  Minions can still be summoned from a destroyed gate, but they will be
  unable to exit the gate area. Conversely, minions outside a destroyed
  gate will be unable to enter.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Search Eye<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  This structure reveals your opponent's minions. If the Search Eye is
  destroyed, you will only be able to see enemy units that are near
  your own minions.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Shield<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  This structure adds defensive strength to Arcana Stones. Destroy the
  enemy Shield and your opponent's Arcana Stones will be more easily
  shattered.

<UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Structural Regeneration<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  All structures except for Arcana Stones can only be temporarily
  destroyed. Their various functions will reactivate at full strength
  after a certain amount of time has passed.
  ※Positioning your minions near a destroyed structure will hasten
  　the reactivation process.

  Each variety of minion is capable of inflicting greater damage against
  certain structures. Learn each unit's strengths, and pick the right
  minion for the job!

<UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Turn the Tide with Special Actions<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  These conditions must be met before a special action can be used:
  ・Four minions of the same variety are gathered in an action party
  ・Each minion in the action party has full action points
   (Action points accumulate over time)
  To perform a special action, select an individual minion from the
  action party, and press the Execute Action button on the minion
  hotbar.

<UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Mastering Traps<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  Some minions will place traps with their special actions. A trap will
  become armed ten seconds after it has been placed, and it can then
  be triggered by pressing the Trigger Trap button on the minion
  hotbar.
  ※Only one trap can be placed at a time.

1004,"Fellowships are gatherings of players who share common interests. With up to 1,000 members permitted in each fellowship, they provide an excellent way to connect and socialize with like-minded adventurers.

1027,"Collectables"
1028,"The higher an item's collectability, the more attractive it is to certain NPCs who are seeking to purchase or trade for them. It should be noted, however, these items must meet a certain collectability threshold before they will be accepted by NPCs."
1029,"The Collectables Interface"
1030,"Selecting a collectable item in the gathering window will open the collectables interface. Here you can try to improve the item's collectability rating before adding it to your inventory."
1031,"Increasing Collectability"
1032,"Techniques such as <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Scour<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> can be employed to increase the collectability of an item. It should be noted, however, the gathering point's <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>integrity<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> is diminished by the use of such actions. Integrity is also reduced when gathering items. One must be mindful of their actions to ensure integrity still remains after reaching a suitable collectability rating."
1033,"Collectable Actions"
1034,"There are three key actions used to raise collectability, each of which reduces the gathering point's integrity by one.

Scour
Increases collectability by a fixed amount determined by your gathering rating.

Brazen Prospector / Brazen Woodsman
Increases collectability by a random amount that may be lower or significantly higher than Scour. A potentially efficient option when gathering in a location where your desired item can be found in abundance.

Meticulous Prospector / Meticulous Woodsman
Increases collectability by a fixed amount lower than Scour. However, there is chance integrity is unaffected. A good option when you're certain your next action will reach the desired collectability rating."
1035,"Gathering Collectables"
1036,"When the item reaches a sufficient collectability rating, use the <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Collect<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> action to gather the item and add it to your inventory. Be mindful, however, that the integrity of the gathering spot is reduced by one for every item gathered. When its integrity reaches zero, no more items can be gathered.

※You may fail to gather an item if its gathering rate is not 100%."
1037,"Improving Collectability"
1038,"The effectiveness of collectable actions such as Scour can be enhanced further by first using <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Scrutiny<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>. While this action does not affect the gathering point's integrity, it does cost GP. A higher perception rating will increase the potency of this action."
1039,"Collector's Intuition"
1040,"When using collectable actions, there is a chance to trigger <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Collector's Intuition<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, granting a bonus to collectability. The chance of triggering this bonus increases with a higher perception rating.

※You may also increase the chance of triggering this bonus by using Collector's Focus."
1041,"Collector's Standard"
1042,"When using collectable actions, there is a chance you will be granted the effect of <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Collector's Standard<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>. While under this effect, the potency of brazen and meticulous actions is increased significantly."
1043,"Other Actions"
1044,"Raising collectability should not be your only focus when gathering collectables. Actions that increase gathering rate, as well as those that grant additional gathering attempts or restore integrity, are also essential to procure as many collectables as possible. Careful planning and effective use of all actions is the key to success for accomplished Disciples of the Land."
1045,"Prime and Sublime Collectables"
1046,"Prime collectable items that have reached maximum collectability will, on occasion, yield exceedingly rare items from aetherial reduction.

Moreover, these prime collectables may also become sublime when they are gathered with maximum collectability, which guarantees a yield of rare items from aetherial reduction.

A higher gathering rate increases your chances of a prime collectable becoming sublime."
1047,"Collectability"
1048,"The collectability of an item is another means of measuring its intrinsic quality.

Collectability required to deliver an item can be confirmed at the top right of the interface.

When breaking down items via aetherial reduction, this rating indicates the collectability required to obtain items other than crystals."
