of my tribe's latrine..."
3606,False,"Though, enough pepper
in the pot, I could boil
my boot and I reckon it'd
taste fine enough."
3607,False,"Like to buy some milk?
Probably good and sour
by now!"

use a basket. Or perhaps
you know someone who

the men it's ready?"
3681,False,"The stew's a bit bland.
Did you forget the salt?"
3682,False,"My apologies. We used
the last this morning."

3735,False,"Nothing to report...to you.
And who are you again?"
3736,False,"I've seen my share of
forbidden lands, but this

those cast-off skins?
Name your price!"

3810,False,"We've got enough food,
but we're running low on arak!"
3811,False,"Understood!"
3812,False,"A marid eats as much
in a day as five chocobos
do in a sennight."
3813,False,"They say the best salt's
that what's been harvested
by hand...er, rake."
3814,False,"They seem to be doing
just fine without my help."

either kill it or you run─
just not in this direction."
3816,False,"I can put an arrow in the
eye of a yabby from a

take ninety-five."
3817,False,"If I find you've been cutting
Master Lolorito's salt with
chalk again..."
3818,False,"Never! You have my word!"
3819,False,"There's plenty of salt to
sell...but no one to buy it."
3820,False,"These blocks are not
going to move themselves."
3821,False,"You've two, don't you?"
3822,False,"I could use another hand."
3823,False,"If it helps Ala Mhigo,
I'll rake from dawn till dusk!"
3824,False,"They say there is none
finer than Saltery salt,
and the Bismarck must
have the finest!"

chocobos. I don't fancy
carrying a sack of salt all
the way back to Gridania..."

I don't know which
to sample first!"

working, it's a matter of
expanding operations..."

work for them all..."

we know what to do with!"
3836,False,"We didn't see nothing if
you didn't see nothing."
3837,False,"But we have done nothing
wrong! Nothing!"
3838,False,"You're looking better today!"
3839,False,"No thanks to you and
your nosiness."
3840,False,"Ishibushi! Help! I know you
can hear me! Ishibushi!"
3841,False,"I can take over, if you like..."
3842,False,"Aye, aye, that's the way..."
3843,False,"Area past the gate's not safe."
3844,False,"It's not a bad idea, but..."
3845,False,"Must you be forever ringing...
that infernal bell..."
3846,False,"So I says to the maiko, I says..."
3847,False,"Way's closed. We're still
clearing plots."

3851,False,"Not now! I'm busy!"
3852,False,"Da says he's gonna throw all
your toys in the One River if
you don't come right now!"
3853,False,"I'm not falling for that again!"
3854,False,"Fine! See what happens!"
3855,False,"Leave the materials here?"
3856,False,"Aye, right there's fine!"
3857,False,"I can't wait to see what it
looks like when it's finished!"
3858,False,"Wonder what they're
going to do with it..."
3859,False,"Where do you want these?"
3860,False,"Give me a moment!"
3861,False,"Where did I leave
that ledger...?"
3862,False,"(Don't...don't mind
me over here... Ugh...)"
3863,False,"Then what would you like
us to purchase instead?"
3864,False,"That ought to suffice for now."
3865,False,"Looks like we've still
got plenty of spices."
3866,False,"Very good, very good..."
3867,False,"Hmm... Thought we had more
around here somewhere..."
3868,False,"I don't think we've got enough
vegetables to last the week."
3869,False,"Let Kozakura know.
She'll take care of it."
3870,False,"Everything is accounted for.
I triple-checked."
3871,False,"Including the materials
for Master Tsuranuki?"
3872,False,"...Perhaps I should check again."
3873,False,"Perhaps you should."
3874,False,"I come bearing gifts!"
3875,False,"Any luck?"
3876,False,"I've got a good feeling..."
3877,False,"Something took the bait!"
3878,False,"Oho!"
3879,False,"A marvelous catch!"
3880,False,"Let's see what else is biting!"
3881,False,"Reeled it in too quickly...?"
3882,False,"Don't give up so easily!"
3883,False,"...Is this upside down?"
3884,False,"Need anything?"
3885,False,"Might could do with
a few more boards!"
3886,False,"I'll see what I can do."
3887,False,"Smiths need more boards─"
3888,False,"It's time to go!"
3889,False,"Can't we stay another night?"
3890,False,"No! We didn't come
all the way here to
laze about!"
3891,False,"But we might never
be able to sleep on
such comfy beds again!"
3892,False,"I'll blame you if
someone else claims those
marks before we do!"
3893,False,"One more night!
That's all I ask!"
3894,False,"Kweh!"
3895,False,"We're spreading
ourselves too thin..."
3896,False,"Tell me, does this hurt?"
3897,False,"Ah! Only when you
poke it like that!"
3898,False,"That means you're
on the mend."
3899,False,"Be more careful in future.
You're no good to us dead."
3900,False,"Argh! My stomach!"
3901,False,"You shouldn't eat
wild berries. They
could be poisonous!"
3902,False,"Do it again, and I'll
cut you open and
dig them out myself!"
3903,False,"I could while away the hours,
Liftin' bags of salt and flour,
If I only had a crane.♪"
3904,False,"Winching her up, then!
Stand clear!"
3905,False,"The buckets are full!"
3906,False,"A manfool!
A manfool in our midst!"
3907,False,"I hate manfools!"
3908,False,"The manfool is still about..."
3909,False,"Gah! What a stalker!"
3910,False,"Haven't seen you around

3911,False,"Sure am! Just went 
through the change!"
3912,False,"Heh, pretty rare for a rat
to live long enough─"
3913,False,"Rat? Rat!?
I am an otter, good sir!"
3914,False,"That's it! I'm going to
go and see the sacred
crystal right this instant!"
3915,False,"Don't do it! Genbu's gonna
put a curse on you!"
3916,False,"Hah! You can't scare me!"
3917,False,"None shall pass!"
3918,False,"Just this once! Please!"
3919,False,"Set one hoof inside and
Genbu will curse you for
ten thousand years!"
3920,False,"Fine! But you haven't
heard the last of this!"
3921,False,"They wouldn't let me pass..."
3922,False,"Of course not!
They didn't before,
so why would they now!?"
3923,False,"It's been a while since
I said hello..."
3924,False,"I am of a mind to hunt.
Interested?"
3925,False,"Such serenity, such peace..."
3926,False,"Though my body aches..."
3927,False,"I no longer fear for my soul.
My thanks to you..."
3928,False,"Hehe, you're funny!"
3929,False,"Do you have any more medicine?"
3930,False,"It's getting harder to come by.
You'll have to pay double."
3931,False,"Didn't think you'd come back,
given your condition..."
3932,False,"...Was curious, is all."
3933,False,"Never hurts to have an extra set of eyes looking over the hull!"
3934,False,"Need to get this
tub patched up..."
3935,False,"Look at you, boy.
Life on the sea has
made you strong..."
3936,False,"Mother, I...
I never thought
I'd see you again."

3942,False,""
3943,False,""
3944,False,"Is it appropriate to
grab him like that?"

I can still carry more."
3947,False,"I could use a dozen more like you..."

Now lift your knees higher."

You slew the meownster!"

My fins hurt too!"

4310,False,"I'd buy that for a gil..."
4311,False,"Down the hatch!"
4312,False,"The path to riches is a perilous one, yes, yes..."
4313,False,"Seven hells!
Get a bloody room, will ye!?"
4314,False,"The next match is mine!"
4315,False,"Mewling cub!
You'll never defeat me!"
4316,False,"I'll show ye how to swing a damn hammer!"
4317,False,"The abyss take me..."
4318,False,"Wh-Which tile should I discard...?"
4319,False,"Well, this is a disaster!"
4320,False,"And one is meant to scale this edifice...?"
4321,False,"Ulalaaa!"
4322,False,"I love you!"
4323,False,"Mashaaa!"
4324,False,"Yes!"
4325,False,"U-lah-lah!"
4326,False,"Hah! Hah!"
4327,False,"Narumiii!"
4328,False,"She looked at me!"
4329,False,"W-We're safe...?"
4330,False,"The sky..."
4331,False,"What's happening...?"
4332,False,"Lord...Vauthry..."
4333,False,"Long may...you reign..."
4334,False,"Ohhh..."
4335,False,"Hallowed be his name..."
4336,False,"Blessed is the meol..."
4337,False,"Is this supposed to be part of the show?"
4338,False,"Something's happening..."
4339,False,"Did you summon those things!?"
4340,False,"What in the gods' name is that!?"
4341,False,"That way! The crown's that way!"
4342,False,"Keep running! You're almost there!"
4343,False,"Phew, we did it..."
4344,False,"Time to collect our prize."
4345,False,"I daresay they've had their fill of sport."
4346,False,"Is... Is it over?"
4347,False,"Their mastery over glamours is truly astounding."
4348,False,"It was no less than what
I expected, but─well done."
4349,False,"Alisaie..."
4350,False,"Rest well..."
4351,False,"A Lightwarden, gone.
I can scarce believe it."
4352,False,"Good. Keep that
memory with you."
4353,False,"That Lightwarden...
That was <Emphasis>terrifying</Emphasis>."
4354,False,"And thus doth the night return."
4355,False,"So the Warden of the wood falls."
4356,False,"We've taken back the darkness!"
4357,False,"At last."
4358,False,"It seems that Ryne was correct."
4359,False,"Thank goodness we succeeded."
4360,False,"That was a passing
strange form for an eater."
4361,False,"Are you at all injured?"
4362,False,"Vauthry awaits."
4363,False,"It's the moment of truth."
4364,False,"No eaters remain to
stand in our way."
4365,False,"I feel it above─
a powerful light."
4366,False,"All has gone to plan thus far.
...To the extent there <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> a plan."
4367,False,"An eater that only makes
the others fiercer. Lovely."
4368,False,"We shall not falter!"
4369,False,"Not for despair, nor fate itself."
4370,False,"Be on your guard.
This is wholly his realm."
4371,False,"<Emphasis>Where</Emphasis> is Emet-Selch?"
4372,False,"This is it─the
first and final end."
4373,False,"The unwinding of life itself..."
4374,False,"One cannot help but pity Vauthry..."
4375,False,"Finally, all the Lightwardens are gone..."
4376,False,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
4377,False,"What should we do when we find them?"
4378,False,"We send them flying! Tee hee!"
4379,False,"Aaany moment now..."
4380,False,"D-Don't let them eat me!"
4381,False,"What in the world...?"
4382,False,"What's wrong with everyone? "
4383,False,"Where...where am I?"
4384,False,"Ungh... My head..."
4385,False,"Long live...Lord Vauthry?"
4386,False,"It was awful... <sob>"
4387,False,"Are you all right?"
4388,False,"Zzzzzz..."
4389,False,"<snore> <snore>"
4390,False,"<slurp> <snort>"
4391,False,"Wake up, damn you!"
4392,False,"What's happening!?"
4393,False,"It's the dust! Don't breathe in the dust!"
4394,False,"Keep an eye on them buggers!"
4395,False,"We're gonna need more meat..."
4396,False,"Who's a pretty girl, then?"
4397,False,"I think...<hic>...I've had enough..."
4398,False,"Whisk, whisk until it's mixed!♪"
4399,False,"Grab a seat!
...And a mug!"
4400,False,"You do too much..."
4401,False,"Ugh, I need a drink..."
4402,False,"Aye, that hits the spot!"
4403,False,"Lali-hooo!"
4404,False,"La... La...li...ho!"
4405,False,"Hup! Ha!"
4406,False,"No swivin' Goggs about, then?"
4407,False,"B-Blast! It's higher than I thought..."
4408,False,"No rips that I can see..."
4409,False,"Heading in for a pint?"
4410,False,"We've got to protect our food stores!"
4411,False,"Is there aught else you need?"
4412,False,"I'm fine for now, thanks."
4413,False,"Just a few more rows!"
4414,False,"Hey! We're meant to do our chores first!"
4415,False,"Wait!"
4416,False,"I'm gonna get you!"
4417,False,"Yay! I got you!"
4418,False,"Nuh-uh! I let you catch me!"
4419,False,"That's enough! You're <Emphasis>both</Emphasis> winners."
4420,False,"Let's play catch-the-kitten!"
4421,False,"All right, you go first!"
4422,False,"This way, slowpoke!"
4423,False,"Almost time to eat!"
4424,False,"W-We'll get you some medicine..."
4425,False,"It's gotta be cooked by now..."
4426,False,"Did you hear what happened to that girl!?"
4427,False,"That ought to keep the wind out."
4428,False,"Please...
Whatever you can spare..."
4429,False,"Maybe I should join him..."
4430,False,"But the letter from the Crystarium said..."
4431,False,"I hope this crop turns out better than the last..."
4432,False,"Don't you wag your finger at me!"
4433,False,"I once knew twins who had hair just like yours!"
4434,False,"We'd best scout the area first."
4435,False,"You can cross that bridge when you come to it."
4436,False,"The forest calls to me..."
4437,False,"I am not lying! I saw it!"
4438,False,"Well, if the others don't get here soon, we'll have to eat their share!"
4439,False,"Give me a moment, would you? I'm sure it's crooked!"
4440,False,"That is what Uimet said, anyway."
4441,False,"It is probably true, in that case."
4442,False,"Is everything ready?"
4443,False,"Master Lanille has taken care of it."
4444,False,"Then I shall return to my post."
4445,False,"I'd better count them again, just to be sure."
4446,False,"Yes, yes! Adorable!"
4447,False,"There must be at least one shiny here!"
4448,False,"Not a bad price, all things considered."
4449,False,"I'll get us a good deal, don't you worry!"
4450,False,"Now, you stay right there!"
4451,False,"Hmm? Where did it go?"
4452,False,"I take my eyes off of it for one moment..."
4453,False,"Come back here!"
4454,False,"Not again!"
4455,False,"Not good, not good..."
4456,False,"There it is!"
4457,False,"You must not wander off like that, understood?"
4458,False,"That's a fair point..."
4459,False,"I have a feeling I've forgotten something."
4460,False,"Come now, you mustn't fret."
4461,False,"It never ceases to amaze.
Every time I see it..."
4462,False,"What am I supposed to do now!?"
4463,False,"A tasty morsel of information, yes?"
4464,False,"Leave no stone unturned..."
4465,False,"To see a sin eater from so close... I will never forget it."
4466,False,"And we'll split the profits!"
4467,False,"Yes, it's all here, as agreed."
4468,False,"So, ready to get back to work?"
4469,False,"Not yet. Still coughing up grey phlegm."
4470,False,"Erm... You might wanna get that looked at..."
4471,False,"The Fuath are nothing but trouble!"
4472,False,"As my master always used to say..."
4473,False,"Yes, better than boiling them, methinks."
4474,False,"A fair trade, it would seem."
4475,False,"A bit on the small side, perhaps..."
4476,False,"Slowly but surely do the mushrooms grow."
4477,False,"The blue one... Or the other blue one... Hmm..."
4478,False,"I am sure my eyesight is getting worse."
4479,False,"Oh! This is a heavy one!"
4480,False,"Gather round, little ones."
4481,False,"And we'll call it “Delta Attack!”"
4482,False,"Let's try shapechanging!"
4483,False,"That sounds like fun!"
4484,False,"Watch this!"
4485,False,"Ooh! I can't wait to see this!"
4486,False,"Piff, paff, poff!"
4487,False,"Eek!"
4488,False,"Oink!"
4489,False,"Hee hee! How terribly amusing!"
4490,False,"Haha! A porxie!"
4491,False,"Oink! Oink!"
4492,False,"Now I just need to work out how to reverse it..."
4493,False,"Wait for me!"
4494,False,"Come back!"
4495,False,"Ummm..."
4496,False,"It's a beaver!"
4497,False,"Snook!"
4498,False,"You'll never catch me!"
4499,False,"Snook! Chit!"
4500,False,"I wonder who pushed up <Emphasis>these</Emphasis> daisies?"
4501,False,"If I eat the whole thing, I shall go “pop!”"
4502,False,"All this frolicking has worn me out..."
4503,False,"Haven't you had enough!?"
4504,False,"Come on, lazy bones! There's frolicking to be done!"
4505,False,"So soft... So fluffy..."
4506,False,"No one can fly higher than meee～♪"
4507,False,"Now you see me, now you don't!"
4508,False,"Found me again! I'll have to try harder!"
4509,False,"Very good! Let's see if you can find me again!"
4510,False,"Ooh! You won't be so lucky next time!"
4511,False,"You're fun! Bye for now!"
4512,False,"Come now, don't sulk! Here, I brought you a flower!"
4513,False,"You're like a walking cloud!"
4514,False,"And they'll never suspect a thing!"
4515,False,"Hurry up and grow!"
4516,False,"Please, anything you can spare!"
4517,False,"That's what you get for pushing your luck!"
4518,False,"Nana nana nana nana, fishing!"
4519,False,"A steal at half the price!"
4520,False,"My fortune is just a few scoops of dirt away!"
4521,False,"As soon as his back's turned, that soup is mine!"
4522,False,"Next time, I'll set the line a bit lower."
4523,False,"Why must there be so many rules?"
4524,False,"I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
4525,False,"Why are they eating pebbles?"
4526,False,"Oh no! It looks like I've burnt it!"
4527,False,"He's gonna eat his face off! I can't wait!"
4528,False,"Go for the ribs! Don't let that bastard breathe!"
4529,False,"One good gust of wind, and the whole thing'll come down."
4530,False,"Maybe it's time to flip them over?"
4531,False,"Take that, you bastard nail! And that!"
4532,False,"This burgling lark's harder than I thought!"
4533,False,"If I stay drunk, I'll never get hungover!"
4534,False,"Stick to the plan, and we can't fail!"
4535,False,"Why must this take so long?"
4536,False,"They're sure to be impressed by my posing!"
4537,False,"Maybe I should draw the curtain..."
4538,False,"Be a good boy and fetch me some wine, would you?"
4539,False,"Yes, milady."
4540,False,"I had hoped there would be something in the Buttress to entertain me..."
4541,False,"...but it seems I was mistaken."
4542,False,"Back to the Understory it is."
4543,False,"Your wine, milady."
4544,False,"Tsk! That bloody fickle cow!"
4545,False,"""Where? Up your arse and 'round the corner!“ Ha!"
4546,False,"I wish they'd make these eyeholes a bit bigger."
4547,False,"Time for a stroll..."
4548,False,"...to the parlor!"
4549,False,"And then the wretched pauper split his head open! Hilarious!"
4550,False,"It's my money, and I'll spend it how I please!"
4551,False,"But, of courshe─hic!─the eldersh musht never know of thish!"
4552,False,"Oh, don't you worry about that, my friend!"
4553,False,"Haha! How very unlike you, Oboro!"
4554,False,"Hic! Perhapsh I have partaken a bit more than─hic─ushual..."
4555,False,"I tire of this place. Come."
4556,False,"Yes, my lady."
4557,False,"How frightfully vulgar!"
4558,False,"I quite agree."
4559,False,"Silence! When I want your opinion, I will ask for it!"
4560,False,"Yes, my lady!"
4561,False,"What I would not give for some stimulating conversation..."
4562,False,"One day, I shall buy this plaza and decorate in the manner of my choosing."
4563,False,"Yes, my lady..."
4564,False,"Care for a drink, sir?"
4565,False,"Can you not see I am busy!?"
4566,False,"I can't even give this stuff away..."
4567,False,"Why will no one take a drink?"
4568,False,"Maybe you should be more assertive?"
4569,False,"All right, I'll try."
4570,False,"Are you sure we haven't got anything better?"
4571,False,"Marry me, and you shall have everything you could wish for!"
4572,False,"It's about time I changed the string."
4573,False,"Oh my! How did you get so dusty?"
4574,False,"All right, you've made your point!"
4575,False,"I'd stick to the path if I were you."
4576,False,"But I'm ready for the front line!"
4577,False,"This ought to last us a while."
4578,False,"I'll work off this beer belly eventually!"
4579,False,"There'll be no trouble, I swear!"
4580,False,"There's something down there, I know it!"
4581,False,"Whoever built this thing must've been in a hurry."
4582,False,"Nothing to report!"
4583,False,"You'd better do one more circuit, just to be sure."
4584,False,"Yes, yes... I know how to do my job, thanks."
4585,False,"Soon, my pretty, soon..."
4586,False,"I could put one in that smug prick's back from up here. He wouldn't even know what hit him..."
4587,False,"And we even managed to get the best room they have!"
4588,False,"We should get away like this more often."
4589,False,"What could you have been doing to end up in such a state?"
4590,False,"Yes, but I hear enormous swords are all the rage!"
4591,False,"I want to see those noses touch the ground!"
4592,False,"If we pull this off, we'll make a killing!"
4593,False,"I swear my eyesight's getting worse..."
4594,False,"If I see you sleeping on the job again, you'll be on latrine duty until I say you've had enough!"
4595,False,"I have a feeling I'm in the wrong place..."
4596,False,"These feathers would fetch a gil or two..."
4597,False,"<pant> <pant>"
4598,False,"This is madness..."
4599,False,"Wh-What do we do...?"
4600,False,"Aaah!"
4601,False,"Shall we?"
4602,False,"Lead the way."
4603,False,"And here we have the Rotunda."
4604,False,"Watering, watering, all day long! "
4605,False,"All finished!"
4606,False,"Good work."
4607,False,"Here's the next batch."
4608,False,"So, I should scatter these in the same place."
4609,False,"That's right!"
4610,False,"And what comes after that?"
4611,False,"Yes, four apples, seven lemons. How many times must you count them!?"
4612,False,"My achin' bones..."
4613,False,"If I stare at those crates long enough, maybe they will move themselves."
4614,False,"Marvelous! Splendid!"
4615,False,"I fear this disagrees with my aesthetic sensibilities..."
4616,False,"This one might do..."
4617,False,"So? Find anything?"
4618,False,"I did indeed!"
4619,False,"And the reward is not bad either!"
4620,False,"Such vibrant colors!"
4621,False,"Where could it have gone?"
4622,False,"I'm sure it wouldn't sprout legs and walk off by itself."
4623,False,"Perhaps it found its way over here?"
4624,False,"Or perhaps not."
4625,False,"Maybe it's lurking in here?"
4626,False,"I do not see that posing any difficulties."
4627,False,"“By the time you read this, I shall surely be...”"
4628,False,"Well, perhaps if you'd brushed your hair away from your eyes, you'd have seen it!"
4629,False,"I should take another look, just in case."
4630,False,"But that would mean that cucumbers are fruit..."
4631,False,"We're still waiting for those new ladders to be delivered, I'm afraid."
4632,False,"“...and ripped out his still-beating heart...”"
4633,False,"I can never find what I'm looking for."
4634,False,"Something about needles and haystacks springs to mind..."
4635,False,"Would it kill them to organize things a bit better?"
4636,False,"Who needs ladders when you have magic!"
4637,False,"So, where is it?"
4638,False,"Erm..."
4639,False,"I didn't ask for an “erm,” did I?"
4640,False,"It should be ready soon."
4641,False,"Any idea how soon?"
4642,False,"I'm afraid not."
4643,False,"Hopefully it won't explode this time..."
4644,False,"Sir, yes, sir!"
4645,False,"You call that a squat!?"
4646,False,"Is everything here yet?"
4647,False,"How goes it?"
4648,False,"Well, it could be worse!"
4649,False,"Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it."
4650,False,"Understood!"
4651,False,"Maybe I should lighten the load..."
4652,False,"I concur."
4653,False,"Well, there goes my lunch..."
4654,False,"Take it or leave it!"
4655,False,"I wonder what the problem is..."
4656,False,"I'd best make a note of this."
4657,False,"Everything seems fine here."
4658,False,"Not great, but acceptable."
4659,False,"Are you sure you don't need any?"
4660,False,"For the last time, no!"
4661,False,"Oh... I see."
4662,False,"I'll try asking again."
4663,False,"He's persistent, I'll give him that."
4664,False,"Oh gods, I think I've torn my breeches!"
4665,False,"How remarkably informative..."
4666,False,"He held an axe in each hand, and another with his tail!"
4667,False,"We have every garment the discerning professional could possibly need!"
4668,False,"It will make a fine gift."
4669,False,"What could possibly go wrong?"
4670,False,"You certainly have an eye for quality!"
4671,False,"Stop whining!"
4672,False,"I'll show her! I can live on stolen bread!"
4673,False,"Think of the profits we'll make!"
4674,False,"So she told him to take a long walk off a short pier!"
4675,False,"I shall leave it to the chef's discretion."
4676,False,"It all seems in order."
4677,False,"Thank you for keeping an eye on it!"
4678,False,"Don't mention it!"
4679,False,"Hmm... No leaks, no strange noises..."
4680,False,"What say you? Are you in?"
4681,False,"It might be easier to shoot them down with my bow."
4682,False,"Yes, about my room..."
4683,False,"I wonder which is the biggest?"
4684,False,"Where did all of these crumbs come from?"
4685,False,"I'm telling you! It's true!"
4686,False,"I want to be the Exarch this time!"
4687,False,"Lali-ho!"
4688,False,"How go the repairs?"
4689,False,"It's practically like new!"
4690,False,"I wonder if they'll really grow..."
4691,False,"Mmmmmm, tastes like samurai..."
4692,False,"I'll have a dozen."
4693,False,"Can't talk─gotta train!"
4694,False,"If you gaze too long into the forest, the forest also gazes into you... "
4695,False,"And for my next trick, a handstand!"
4696,False,"Finlesss one, eh?"
4697,False,"I have a quessstion..."
4698,False,"Are you just going to ssstand there all day!?"
4699,False,"But it is ssso dry!"
4700,False,"But when you consider the
implications of this latest
calamity, you must admit..."
4701,False,"Trust in the scholars.
They will find a solution."
4702,False,"What a precocious
little child!"
4703,False,"If you could perhaps
explain the finer points
of the creation process..."
4704,False,"Yes, yes. Quite right..."
4705,False,"Citizens must be held
to a higher standard..."
4706,False,"They've convened an
emergency assembly."
4707,False,"This concerns us all."
4708,False,"Agreed. We must hurry..."
4709,False,"There's an incredible
concept I just know
you'll adore..."
4710,False,"You... I know...
No, never mind."
4711,False,"The subject's potential
is far beyond our
wildest expectations..."
4712,False,"Where to put this...?"
4713,False,"I'm all for people having fun, but can't they learn to pick up after themselves?"
4714,False,"It's a mess, all right. But it could have been worse."
4715,False,"Look what I found!"
4716,False,"We have to clean up this mess before Master Gegeruju sees it..."
4717,False,"Even pirates clean up better than this!"

4918,False,"Great! Let's collect lots and decorate with them!"
4919,False,"Phew. I'm glad for that to be over and done with."
4920,False,"We'd best leave the negotiations to Alphinaud and the Exarch."
4921,False,"Perhaps now we have afforded ourselves an audience."
4922,False,"Now they have little choice but to hear our plea."
4923,False,"So, what kind of dream should we spin next?"
4924,False,"I'm not sure. What do you think?"
4925,False,"Hmmm..."
4926,False,"How about...a great big sheep?"

4928,False,"Imagine it─we could drink and play at the same time!"
4929,False,"Oh, that sounds wonderful!"
4930,False,"Let's make lots of big sheep and drown all of Lyhe Mheg in milk!"
4931,False,"Uh... We're going to need to have a little talk..."
4932,False,"How about...a great big beast?"
4933,False,"Something that's a natural predator to the you-know-whats!"

5178,False,"Hm, might be a little short..."
5179,False,"What to do with this one..."
5180,False,"Right, next on the docket..."
5181,False,"A fine vantage point for capturing the restoration."
5182,False,"You'll be warm if you keep moving!"
5183,False,"Brrr... C-Can't we go somewhere warm?"
5184,False,"Gods, but I'm spent..."

5201,False,"Ah, blessed warmth..."
5202,False,"Such a grand house... It's wasted on me alone."
5203,False,"You're going to fall!"
5204,False,"We could ask the residents if they need help?"
5205,False,"How about a foray to the Diadem?"
5206,False,"I personally could use a rest..."
5207,False,"So, what shall we do next?"

5218,False,"It's going to break any moment now, miss! I can feel it!"
5219,False,"How's my form, Chief?"
5220,False,"Thank you, sir!"
5221,False,"Others will take care of the streets. We're looking ahead to the next stage!"
5222,False,"The pile of debris needs to go first!"

5258,False,"Bah!"
5259,False,"The houses are coming along nicely."
5260,False,"Begging your pardons, but these houses are for war-displaced Ishgardian citizens."

5262,False,"The end is in sight! Let's stay focused!"
5263,False,"Honestly! Pay attention, will you!?"
5264,False,"Damn, what's the word for when you─
OWWW!"

5266,False,"A masterpiece, even if I do say so myself."
5267,False,"You've improved in leaps and bounds, all of you!"
5268,False,"Yes, you may be proud of yourselves!"
5269,False,"<sniff> It's hard to believe we built something so beautiful."

5271,False,"There's strength in numbers...and in huge muscles!"
5272,False,"This building shall provide affordable housing for many families."
5273,False,"Thank you!"
5274,False,"Thank you... (I'll never live this down...)"
5275,False,"That was a close call. Be careful next time, both of you."
5276,False,"Behold the beauteous bladework of a Temple Knight!"
5277,False,"Feel the irrepressible power of the darkside!"
5278,False,"These houses are intended for war-displaced citizens such as your good selves."
5279,False,"Truly? We can live here?"

5319,False,"<huff> <huff> Yeah, we've got to do it again!"
5320,False,"Many thanks to those who came to our aid."
5321,False,"Just a little further to go..."
5322,False,"Dare I say we've seen the last of them?"
5323,False,"They were all bathed in Light... Why?"
5324,False,"There can be no doubt─'tis indeed the Exarch's magick."
5325,False,"That proved quite a detour, but all's well that ends well."
5326,False,"Play with us, Urianger! Just a little longer!"

5366,False,"This either makes us look tough, or like we're squatting for another reason entirely."
5367,False,"We're not shirking! This is serious work, I'd have you know!"
5368,False,"Yeah! We're the Croaking Bullfrogs, and we wanna be just like Ronitt!"

5493,False,"You got it, Chief!"
5494,False,"Ungh!"
5495,False,"Finally figured out how to use that pickaxe, I see."
5496,False,"How about you try your hand with a hammer next?"
5497,False,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5498,False,"Thank ye kindly!"
5499,False,"Pound! Smash! Crash!"
5500,False,"Hyah!"
5501,False,"Let me show you how it's done."
5502,False,"You lift the hammer like this, then...yah!"
5503,False,"Aha...so the secret's to take a running start!"
5504,False,"Phew! I need a rest..."
5505,False,"We should check on the others' progress."
5506,False,"Sounds like a plan!"
5507,False,"Is that blood? Am I bleeding!? Oh, the pain!"
5508,False,"Do you require more supplies?"
5509,False,"Progress report! And be quick about it!"
5510,False,"Are you sure that isn't upside down?"
5511,False,"Mustn't forget to take inventory..."
5512,False,"Hm? What curious foreign tongue is this?"
5513,False,"This should suffice for the time being, Chief."
5514,False,"That scaffold looks awfully wobbly..."
5515,False,"Right on schedule, Chief!"
5516,False,"Now, what do we need here...?"
5517,False,"I'll see that we're all stocked up!"
5518,False,"Those are for repairing the rooves. And these..."
5519,False,"This stone should serve us well."
5520,False,"Let's see. We still need to stock up on..."
5521,False,"Excellent. No delays here."
5522,False,"Now, what tasks remain undone?"
5523,False,"My stonemasonry skills will do Ishgard proud!"
5524,False,"This, too, would make for a stirring painting..."
5525,False,"I'll prepare a copy of the construction schedule for you."
5526,False,"Only the finest materials will do!"
5527,False,"Get a hold of yourself, damn it! It's a long way down!"
5528,False,"This should serve nicely for the floor."
5529,False,"This is so easy, I could do it with my eyes clo─
OWWW!"
5530,False,"You must hone your eye for stone."
5531,False,"Don't forget to haul the materials in the proper order!"
5532,False,"The slightest chip or crack could send the walls crashing down."
5533,False,"Yes, this should suffice..."
5534,False,"Let me take another look..."
5535,False,"I'll do my best!"
5536,False,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5537,False,"We'll be needing extra hands for this."
5538,False,"Watch out for your hand!"
5539,False,"Maybe carpentry isn't for you..."
5540,False,"There's no need to rush, you know."
5541,False,"To build a strong foundation, every nail counts..."
5542,False,"I think I've finally got the hang of─
OWWW!"
5543,False,"A little tap here, and a little tap there..."
5544,False,"If only I weren't so clumsy..."
5545,False,"How majestic!"
5546,False,"Such beautiful stone!"
5547,False,"Are you certain we have enough materials?"
5548,False,"Your thoroughness is admirable..."
5549,False,"I'm prone to mistakes─that's why I always check thrice!"
5550,False,"You'll find no better stone in all of Eorzea!"
5551,False,"Fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty─wait, did I count that one twice?"
5552,False,"If I just stack these here..."
5553,False,"This should do!"
5554,False,"Oho! Looking good, indeed!"
5555,False,"Steady now..."
5556,False,"Sigh... Why doesn't she ever notice me?"
5557,False,"Watch out for the thumb...watch out for the─
OWWW!"
5558,False,"Heh! Lookin' good, eh?"
5559,False,"Fastest hammer in Ishgard, I tell you!"
5560,False,"Eat up! You'll need all the strength you can muster for the next shift!"
5561,False,"Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral wasn't built on an empty stomach, you know."
5562,False,"I'm going to feel this tomorrow..."
5563,False,"Time to work off that last flagon of ale!"
5564,False,"Unnngaaah!"
5565,False,"Nnngraaaaaah!"
5566,False,"It's all in the hips...hyaaah!"
5567,False,"Right! I'll tell the others."
5568,False,"...And that's what's on the agenda for tomorrow."
5569,False,"Hoooh! Haaah! Hoooh! Haaah!"
5570,False,"It just won't break. Am I not doing this right?"
5571,False,"Why won't anyone look at <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>!?"
5572,False,"How do you even lift that thing?"
5573,False,"Not easily, I'll tell you that..."
5574,False,"Let me guess...is it pineapple!?"
5575,False,"The chef told me the secret ingredient in the stew..."
5576,False,"This shall be the scene for my next masterpiece!"
5577,False,"Restoring such a mighty structure will be no small task...!"
5578,False,"The smashing's over! It's repairing time!"
5579,False,"The damage here is even worse than I thought..."
5580,False,"What do I get to smash next!?"
5581,False,"Can this truly be restored to its former glory?"
5582,False,"You're an inspiration to us all, Chief..."
5583,False,"Getting the stairwells just right is tricky, I hear..."
5584,False,"There's nothing my muscles can't overcome!"
5585,False,"Ngggaaaaaahhh!"
5586,False,"Yaaaaaahhh!"
5587,False,"It's all in the hips, they say!"
5588,False,"Next up is..."
5589,False,"Aye, this should serve nicely!"
5590,False,"Everything appears in good order..."
5591,False,"Isn't it impressive?"
5592,False,"Look at the size of this one!"
5593,False,"That should do."
5594,False,"Take care not to fall!"
5595,False,"You're quite dedicated, aren't you?"
5596,False,"A masterpiece shall be wrought..."
5597,False,"This is almost fun!"
5598,False,"I must do Ishgard proud with my stonework..."
5599,False,"Whatever you say, Chief!"
5600,False,"All stocked up!"
5601,False,"Hm? Did I miscount?"
5602,False,"Just like clockwork!"
5603,False,"Now where did I leave my hammer?"
5604,False,"A solid base if I ever saw one."
5605,False,"Looking good, I'd say."
5606,False,"How goes it?"
5607,False,"This is the final push!"
5608,False,"Do you know a good chirurgeon? My back is killing me..."
5609,False,"That's why I told you to lift with your legs..."
5610,False,"Looking better and better!"
5611,False,"And that should do it!"
5612,False,"Isn't she a beauty?"
5613,False,"Ooh! I want to fly in that!"
5614,False,"Is it done yet?"
5615,False,"I'd say you've earned yourselves a break."
5616,False,"Rest up well, for there's still work to be done!"
5617,False,"With a bit more muscle, maybe I'd be better at this..."
5618,False,"Your biceps! They cry out in pain!"
5619,False,"This wall appears to have escaped the war unscathed..."
5620,False,"I'll place an order. How many?"
5621,False,"We'll be needing more pickaxes."
5622,False,"Fine material, this!"
5623,False,"I must take inventory and report back quickly..."
5624,False,"...Ahhhhhh! Working so hard, sometimes I forget to breathe!"
5625,False,"A sight to stir the heart and inspire me to the heights of creative genius!"
5626,False,"This one's sure to be his magnum opus!"
5627,False,"Why, it's lovely!"
5628,False,"Best rest up now before the test flight."
5629,False,"Yes, I could use a cup of piping hot tea."
5630,False,"They're gone! Now's our chance!"
5631,False,"Kweh! Kweh!♪"
5632,False,"Kweh..."
5633,False,"Would you sit down?"
5634,False,"How can I? I should be out there, cutting down imperials!"
5635,False,"It is vital we overcome their advantage in numbers."
5636,False,"An advantage that keeps growing. Xeven's men were hit especially hard."
5637,False,"The enemy could launch a surprise attack at any moment, so be prepared!"
5638,False,"You'd be better off heading back to the infirmary and having that leg looked at."
5639,False,"But I can still fight!"
5640,False,"Most flattering... Ahem! For the sultana, that is."
5641,False,"Would that I could stay longer, but duty beckons..."
5642,False,"I remember it as though it were yesterday."
5643,False,"I fear the time has come for us to depart."
5644,False,"Does Philestiaux have any new tasks that need doing?"
5645,False,"Perhaps there are supplies that need procuring."
5646,False,"No good work ever got done on an empty stomach!"
5647,False,"I'd like nothing more than to go on a grand adventure!"
5648,False,"I've decided to return to Limsa. My beloved may be lost forever, but at least there I have memories..."
5649,False,"Look, we can use this stepladder!"
5650,False,"Hey, wait for me!"
5651,False,"W-Watch out!"
5652,False,"Are you sure this will suffice?"
5653,False,"Be sure to keep the inventory up to date."
5654,False,"You really have a way with that chisel, don't you?"
5655,False,"Hey, I'm no slouch myself!"
5656,False,"Heh! You're too kind, miss..."
5657,False,"This should do, Chief!"
5658,False,"One stone on top of the next..."
5659,False,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5660,False,"The stairwell must be finished with all speed!"
5661,False,"One step at a time─Featherfall won't be built in a day!"
5662,False,"Good as done, Chief!"
5663,False,"This wall seems no worse for the wear..."
5664,False,"Cut, lay, fit, and repeat..."
5665,False,"Building a curved arch of stone is no small task!"
5666,False,"Perfection is ever elusive, but I am rather pleased with how this place turned out."
5667,False,"I'll study well, Chief!"
5668,False,"This magnificent window frame deserves only the finest glass...!"
5669,False,"Ishgardian architecture is truly the pride of the realm!"
5670,False,"The inclination of the slope is just as the chief calculated!"
5671,False,"Preposterous! Or is it...?"
5672,False,"They say the savior of Ishgard <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> labors among us!"
5673,False,"How is it staying in the Hoarfrost?"
5674,False,"Why, I've never lived in such comfort!"
5675,False,"Oh, I've forgotten something again!"
5676,False,"Shhh! I'm trying to hide here!"
5677,False,"Where haven't I looked...?"
5678,False,"The captain runs a tight ship, to say the least..."
5679,False,"The freshest catches of the day, and exotic spices to season them! We have all you need!"
5680,False,"What shall we order from Maisenta?"
5681,False,"Mayhap some nuts and other fruits of the forest?"
5682,False,"By the Twelve, it's cold here! I can scarce feel my fingertips!"
5683,False,"Do any of our fine products catch your discerning eye?"
5684,False,"Good work, men!"
5685,False,"Get some rest! The next stage will be a demanding one."
5686,False,"Here's to a job well done!"
5687,False,"I could swear my biceps are bigger..."
5688,False,"My muscles haven't failed me yet!"
5689,False,"I knew I could count on you!"
5690,False,"Phew! That was the toughest job yet..."
5691,False,"My masterpiece is complete!"
5692,False,"Hey! What are you doing in there!?"
5693,False,"Get down at once─it's dangerous up there!"
5694,False,"Manacutter, full speed ahead! Whee!"
5695,False,"The adults are back! Let's get out of here!"
5696,False,"I'm sorry, mister!"
5697,False,"Practice the motion until it becomes second nature!"
5698,False,"Don't ask me! I don't know!"
5699,False,"You're always alone. Is something the matter?"
5700,False,"I lost my husband in the war..."
5701,False,"If there's anything I can do for you, just say the word!"
5702,False,"You're too kind..."
5703,False,"What in the─!? Noooooo!"
5704,False,"So this is the new branch of the manufactory..."
5705,False,"I can't wait to get to work!"
5706,False,"He's truly outdone himself this time."
5707,False,"Ishgard's not so bad...once you get used to the cold."
5708,False,"At least we won't lack for company."
5709,False,"Leave the cooking to me!"
5710,False,"And the manufactory's just a hop, skip, and jump away!"
5711,False,"It's the savior of Ishgard! In the flesh! Can I shake your hand?"
5712,False,"This is sure to win her heart!"
5713,False,"This should do it!"
5714,False,"The auger's store of aether is running low..."
5715,False,"The beaches are safe, for now... Let's hope that shark stays in the water where it belongs."
5716,False,"If any mean old sharks come ashore, Khloe will scare them away! Don't worry, Zhloe!"
5717,False,"Oh, you're Zhloe's personal hero!"
5718,False,"Now, let's go play on the beach!"
5719,False,"The emissaries never give up..."
5720,False,"And neither will I!"
5721,False,"You know, I'd love to perform here."
5722,False,"I could sing for my friends and family..."
5723,False,"I'll talk to the seneschal.
He wouldn't dare say no!"
5724,False,"It's always so colorful!"
5725,False,"Did you see the costumes?"
5726,False,"For the Songbirds?
Yes! Lisette did a fine job!"
5727,False,"Tra la la la la.♪"
5728,False,"Do doo da doo.♪"
5729,False,"La di da dah.♪"
5730,False,"Look! It's the Songbirds!"
5731,False,"Gosh, they're gorgeous!"
5732,False,"Shall we watch for a while?"
5733,False,"I suppose we should go..."
5734,False,"That was so much fun!"
5735,False,"It certainly was!"
5736,False,"I feel so close to Ulala!"
5737,False,"Now that you mention it..."
5738,False,"They do seem alike, kupo!"
5739,False,"Ulala! Over here!"
5740,False,"Narumi! My queen!"
5741,False,"Masha, I love you!"
5742,False,"I adore your outfits!"
5743,False,"The Songbirds are life!"
5744,False,"I wish we could talk to Elyne again."
5745,False,"And Kupka, too!"
5746,False,"Just a little more rest, then I can see the Songbirds!"
5747,False,"It's all so pretty!"
5748,False,"I wanted to help decorate..."
5749,False,"Oh my..."
5750,False,""
5751,False,""
5752,False,"Where... <pant> <pant> could she have gone?"
5753,False,"Which do you prefer, my dear?"
5754,False,"Oh, the one with the ribbon is just lovely!"
5755,False,"Stay focused, now."
5756,False,"Don't show any fear─they can smell it!"
5757,False,"Quite a fight she put up..."
5758,False,"Blood! Blood! Blood!"
5759,False,"One of you should take responsibility!"
5760,False,"Hurry up and punish somebody already."
5761,False,"I'm so tired of this."
5762,False,"I can't relax until we hang <Emphasis>someone</Emphasis> out to dry."
5763,False,"I haven't done anything...that you can prove."
5764,False,"I haven't slept in a week!"
5765,False,"Or twenty! Haha... Please help me."
5766,False,"Should have all the parts you need here."
5767,False,"The workshop seems so...peaceful."
5768,False,"Busy time?"
5769,False,"Seems like you could use a hand."
5770,False,"Perfect. I'll have a look."
5771,False,"Take a break! Relax!"
5772,False,"I can't believe we're working with Neillemard!"
5773,False,"More importantly, Nimie. Her eyes are so piercing... <sigh>"
5774,False,"True, but Denys is the gorgeous one..."
5775,False,"Wait, how long have we been out here?"
5776,False,"I could not have asked for a better present than spending the Starlight season with you!"
5777,False,"It's a miracle I was granted a respite from my duties."
5778,False,"Is it just me, or do things look particularly festive this year?"
5779,False,"We couldn't have done it without you."
5780,False,"See those decorations? They were all mine!"
5781,False,"They're beautiful! You truly have an eye for these things..."
5782,False,"We've got some new faces joining us today!"
5783,False,"Great! We could use the help!"
5784,False,"Rookies to boss around? All right!"
5785,False,"I'm with you, Chief!"
5786,False,"I'll put some muscle on you!"
5787,False,"Pray disregard my station. I will perform any task, and gladly."
5788,False,"Hyah!"
5789,False,"Can't help but feel I'm a bit rusty after all that time off..."
5790,False,"This thing is heavier than it looks..."
5791,False,"Ho!"
5792,False,"This city has so many more faces I must capture on canvas..."
5793,False,"Right back in the swing of things─just as I like to see it."
5794,False,"Have you ever lifted a pickaxe in your life?"
5795,False,"Good to be back on the job, Chief!"
5796,False,"I fear this is my first foray into manual labor..."
5797,False,"Let an expert show you how it's done!"
5798,False,"I thank you for your wisdom, my friend."
5799,False,"You have potential, I'll say that much."
5800,False,"Have to provide a good example for the newcomers!"
5801,False,"Yes, it's coming back to me now! It's all in the hips..."
5802,False,"Eyaaahhh!"
5803,False,"It's as hard as a... Well, I guess it is a rock."
5804,False,"All right! Which one of you dumped this rubbish here!?"
5805,False,"Now, now... Let's take a deep breath..."
5806,False,"How am I supposed to read these chocobo scratches!?"
5807,False,"Are you not, perchance, holding that backwards?"
5808,False,"Sixteen? Are you sure it wasn't eighteen?"
5809,False,"When in doubt, it never hurts to consult the skybuilders' board."
5810,False,"This is a vital task! Our inventory's not going to count itself."
5811,False,"Hey you! Up there! Don't forget to show the rookies how it's done!"
5812,False,"Keeping inventory may not be a glamorous task, but it's a necessary one."
5813,False,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5814,False,"Consider it done, milo─er, Lord Chief."
5815,False,"We've got materials in spades, but we could use a few more hands."
5816,False,"Just leave it to me."
5817,False,"Let's see what else needs doing..."
5818,False,"I'll prepare it at once!"
5819,False,"I'd best place a new order before we run out of supplies..."
5820,False,"Report to me as soon as your task is done, you hear?"
5821,False,"Got it, Miss!"
5822,False,"How many times must I tell you to keep your eye on the nail!?"
5823,False,"Must keep focus... Must keep focus..."
5824,False,"Allow me to show you how it's─owww!"
5825,False,"Oh, dear... That couldn't have felt good..."
5826,False,"A tappity-tap here, a tappity-tap there..."
5827,False,"Am I doing this right?"
5828,False,"Looking good! Keep it up!"
5829,False,"I don't want to see a single bent nail! Understood?"
5830,False,"How's this, Chief?"
5831,False,"Looking rather sharp, if I do say so myself! Haha!"
5832,False,"Consider it done, Lord─er, Chief."
5833,False,"The masses may not appreciate it, but this will be my greatest masterpiece yet!"
5834,False,"Numbers aren't your strong suit, are they?"
5835,False,"Better safe than sorry..."
5836,False,"Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-four... Wait, where was I again?"
5837,False,"Pray forgive my impropriety, but mayhap you forgot seventy-three...?"
5838,False,"Sounds good to me!"
5839,False,"We have enough supplies here, yes?"
5840,False,"Shall I bring more from our reserves?"
5841,False,"Always good to see my skybuilders get into their work!"
5842,False,"Don't forget to rest up from time to time. We've a long way to go."
5843,False,"I learned it all from you, Chief!"
5844,False,"Now <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> a generous donation! We'll put it to good use!"
5845,False,"You are far too kind, Chief..."
5846,False,"I said, watch out!"
5847,False,"Have to set a good example for the newcomers...!"
5848,False,"It's all in the─ow! Okay, now that was an example of what <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to do."
5849,False,"Shall I summon a healer?"
5850,False,"At this rate, I'm going to run out of nails..."
5851,False,"One task done, now it's on to the next..."
5852,False,"Your technique's improved, I see."
5853,False,"I reckon you're a natural at this."
5854,False,"Tap, tap, tappity-tap!"
5855,False,"This may very well be my best work yet!"
5856,False,"You flatter me overmuch, Chief..."
5857,False,"Don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look─damn it all!"
5858,False,"Just like that, now. Take it nice and easy."
5859,False,"Truth be told, I enjoy working in silence."
5860,False,"You'll want to climb up to make sure everything is in place."
5861,False,"I can see I still have much to learn from my seniors..."
5862,False,"Now you're talking. I'm famished!"
5863,False,"Shall we take a short respite?"
5864,False,"Your stamina has improved greatly. Consider me impressed."
5865,False,"Always remember: endurance is as important as technique─if not more so."
5866,False,"Thanks, Chief! I've trained hard for this day!"
5867,False,"I'd best take another look at the plans..."
5868,False,"Endurance indeed. I thank you for your wisdom, Chief."
5869,False,"Be careful now, will you!?"
5870,False,"I've never seen wood of such quality!"
5871,False,"I've got it down this time, I swear. Just watch me n─owww!"
5872,False,"How did I know that was going to happen...?"
5873,False,"Bam! Bam! Bam!"
5874,False,"I wouldn't mind living in a house like this myself!"
5875,False,"Keep it up, and you'll need my supervision no longer."
5876,False,"Don't get ahead of yourself, now. One nail at a time."
5877,False,"Heh! I could never have done it without you, Chief!"
5878,False,"Could it be? Are we ahead of schedule?"
5879,False,"I will endeavor to do just that, milo─er, Chief."
5880,False,"Develop an eye for quality materials, and it will serve you well."
5881,False,"Just need to smooth and polish, now..."
5882,False,"I've developed quite the discerning eye, if I do say so myself..."
5883,False,"Do we have all we need?"
5884,False,"'Tis an honor to serve, Chief."
5885,False,"You've quite an aptitude for art, I'd say."
5886,False,"I reckon I'm even more talented with a chisel than with a hammer!"
5887,False,"I mean not to boast, but I have trained some in artistic pursuits."
5888,False,"Consider it done!"
5889,False,"Here it is! You know where it all goes. Thank you kindly!"
5890,False,"Well? What do you think?"
5891,False,"Remember: the final inspection's nigh as important as the job itself."
5892,False,"This won't hold in its current state. Better to reinforce it further."
5893,False,"Not a crack or blemish to speak of!"
5894,False,"That should do it! Now, to take one final look..."
5895,False,"As you command, Chief."
5896,False,"You require a demonstration, you say? Very well, then..."
5897,False,"The key is to put your whole body into it. Now behold! Hyaaaaaaaaah!"
5898,False,"You'll get the hang of it in no time."
5899,False,"What in the hells is this made of? My axe's scarcely even scratching it!"
5900,False,"If only the chief would give me a private lesson, too..."
5901,False,"Such power!"
5902,False,"The student has become a teacher. What a marvelous sight!"
5903,False,"This task is mine─and mine alone!"
5904,False,"It's all in the hips, you see?"
5905,False,"'Tis not nearly so simple as it looks. Your wisdom is invaluable."
5906,False,"How did it go again? The chief makes it look so easy..."
5907,False,"For the Firmament! For the chief! For our future!"
5908,False,"You've come a long way, haven't you?"
5909,False,"She'll notice me sooner or later─I just know it!"
5910,False,"That's the way!"
5911,False,"He-YAH!"
5912,False,"Is my work satisfactory?"
5913,False,"Mark my words: you will break before me. Hah!"
5914,False,"Ngggh... Yah!"
5915,False,"To think the reconstruction effort is almost at an end... Such a bittersweet feeling, it is."
5916,False,"Well, look who's showing the rookies the ropes now!"
5917,False,"I still remember the day he first joined up. He's like a whole new man!"
5918,False,"Worry not─I'll show you how it's done!"
5919,False,"You are truly a generous teacher, my friend."
5920,False,"Don't overdo it. Injure yourself, and you'll be no use to anyone."
5921,False,"You've got a knack for numbers. We've sorely needed someone like you."
5922,False,"This is quality stone, Chief! I can vouch for it!"
5923,False,"I can't shake the feeling that we're running low..."
5924,False,"I've done the calculations, and I do believe we have sufficient quantities of everything."
5925,False,"I just finished my count─I guarantee you I overlooked nothing!"
5926,False,"Thanks to you, I've neither a dearth nor a surplus of supplies!"
5927,False,"That's the last task on my list. I'd best check back at the skybuilders' board."
5928,False,"Aha...duly noted."
5929,False,"Everything seems to be in good order here."
5930,False,"Yes, <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>! <Emphasis>This</Emphasis> shall be my magnum opus!"
5931,False,"Oho! I can scarcely wait to see the finished work!"
5932,False,"Is there no limit to this man's talent and passion!?"
5933,False,"Why, it is as if the city comes to life on his canvas!"
5934,False,"Are my eyes to be believed?"
5935,False,"Practice makes perfect, after all!"
5936,False,"My fingers don't sting for once! Amazing!"
5937,False,"Pray teach me to wield the hammer with such skill."
5938,False,"Excellent. Make sure to teach the others."
5939,False,"Looking good. Carry on, carry on..."
5940,False,"Precision and speed. Both are essential..."
5941,False,"Where'd the chief go...?"
5942,False,"Might I trouble you to inspect my work, Chief?"
5943,False,"Hyah! Hyah!"
5944,False,"But of course! I'll be finished here any moment..."
5945,False,"We have another task for you..."
5946,False,"Look at how he's grown..."
5947,False,"Generous souls went out of their way to gather these materials for us. We must make the most of them."
5948,False,"Remember, quantity means nothing without quality!"
5949,False,"I am indebted to you for your wisdom."
5950,False,"I can scarce feel my hands!"
5951,False,"Have we finished, then...?"
5952,False,"She's twitching... Is that normal?"
5953,False,"Nothing quite like a kiln-fresh familiar."
5954,False,"I never knew familiar-creation could be so rough..."
5955,False,"Do you reckon these are dry yet?"
5956,False,"Welcome to the Firmament, my dear madam! What brings you to these heavenly environs today?"
5957,False,"I make for the Abacus. They say some most exquisite silks from the Far East have arrived!"
5958,False,"How splendid! Might I have the honor of escorting you there?"
5959,False,"You are far too kind, my good ser. 'Twould be a pleasure."
5960,False,"Fine furs and hides to shelter your skin from the bitter cold!"
5961,False,"Have anythin' what needs fixin'? I'm your man!"
5962,False,"I've never seen anything quite like it..."
5963,False,"Say no more, my good man! I have everything you need..."
5964,False,"Do you perchance have needles and thread in supply? I mean to learn weaving..."
5965,False,"Mayhap I, too, will write my memoirs one day..."
5966,False,"Ow! I want to find whoever dropped that kupo nut on the street and slap them silly!"
5967,False,"To soak a bit longer or head for the steam baths? <Emphasis>That</Emphasis> is the question..."
5968,False,"What a breathtaking sight...!"
5969,False,""
5970,False,"A studio befitting my prodigious talents!"
5971,False,"My masterpieces will surely fetch good coin in Featherfall..."
5972,False,"I will stop at nothing to see the Firmament safe for residents and visitors alike!"
5973,False,"All right, time to make the rounds again..."
5974,False,"This is our new home! Isn't it lovely?"
5975,False,"How warm and toasty it must be inside!"
5976,False,"How long does she mean to keep me waiting...?"
5977,False,"I bought some fine wine from a distant land. What say we raise a toast?"
5978,False,"Beg pardon, but what are you doing in front of our house?"
5979,False,"Finally, my dear sister and I have a home of our own!"
5980,False,"Let's go inside. We'll catch our death of cold out here."
5981,False,"The child will meet us here, they say?"
5982,False,"So I was told. Let us give her the warmest of welcomes."
5983,False,"W-Welcome, child─er, my daughter."
5984,False,"Forgive your father, my dear. He can be terribly stiff on these occasions."
5985,False,"Father! Mother! How happy I am to be part of your family!"
5986,False,"Well, doesn't your coat look so warm and toasty!"
5987,False,"Baaaaaa! Baaaaaa!"

5991,False,"It's all in the hips!"
5992,False,"Well, look who's come to visit!"
5993,False,"Might I join you, kupo?"
5994,False,"'Tis my duty to see that all the instruments are tuned to perfection."
5995,False,"What a magnificent structure! Whatever do you suppose it's for?"
5996,False,"They say it's to serve as lodgings for luminaries and guests of honor."
5997,False,"No entry allowed. The interior is still undergoing renovations."
5998,False,"But that's all the coin I have..."
5999,False,"The other vendors may not be open for business yet, but we certainly are!"
6000,False,"How far this place has come..."
6001,False,"So these are our new barracks, eh?"
6002,False,"We'll need to ensure they're properly outfitted..."
6003,False,"Just look at this place! When are we moving in?"
6004,False,"Grow strong, my seedlings..."
6005,False,"Headed to the Pillars? They're just beyond here."
6006,False,"Ahhh! Who needs a waterfall when we have this right here in town?"
6007,False,"When will they let us in to play?"
6008,False,"Baaaaaa!"
6009,False,"Poor thing! Are you lost?"
6010,False,"Where, oh where did my dear little Dolly run off to!?"
6011,False,"The owner of this home is a stickler for detail. I don't want to see a single nail out of place!"
6012,False,"Oh, thank you for lighting my lovelies. Did they not shine so beautifully in the sky?"
6013,False,"Captain... Pray let me retire while my limbs are still intact..."
6014,False,"Oh! I know the perfect lullaby!"
6015,False,"Whatever must I do to get you to close your eyes...?"
6016,False,"Let's take it to old Marcelloix's shop. There's nothing he can't fix."
6017,False,"It's broken! Whatever can I do, Grandpa?"
6018,False,"I...I'm f-fine! Honest!"
6019,False,"Worry not! I'll catch you!"
6020,False,"Next, it's my time to shine!"
6021,False,"Ah, nothing like a dance to forget one's worries!"
6022,False,"They'll never think to look for me here..."
6023,False,"Looks like it wasn't such a good hiding place after all..."
6024,False,"And now you're on our side. Let's look for the other two!"
6025,False,"Haha! Found you!"
6026,False,"Ungh..."
6027,False,"Only healers and staff are permitted on the upper levels."
6028,False,"Nothing I can't bear. I will be out of this place in no time."
6029,False,"Does it hurt, my dear?"
6030,False,"What I wouldn't give to walk the streets again..."
6031,False,"Now where did I leave that phial?"
6032,False,"Did you sleep well?"
6033,False,"But I'm glad you didn't keep me waiting here too long!"
6034,False,"All looks in order, you say? Splendid!"
6035,False,"Hah! That's what I like to see."
6036,False,"Not a scratch on it, Chief!"
6037,False,"No issues in terms of quantity or quality, milord."
6038,False,"How do our stores hold up?"
6039,False,"Have you any tasks for me?"
6040,False,"Have I ever! Where to begin...?"
6041,False,"Fine, ignore me like that! I'll show them I can do the work as well as anyone."
6042,False,"No rest for the weary..."
6043,False,"This is taking its toll on my back..."
6044,False,"Indeed..."
6045,False,"This one's a quick learner..."
6046,False,"Rest is important, too! Even the chief says so!"
6047,False,"That's not fair! You're better at this than me!"
6048,False,"I do believe I've got the knack of this..."
6049,False,"You've grown into a fine craftsman!"
6050,False,"You've got skill, that much is certain."
6051,False,"How does it look, Chief?"
6052,False,"I'm working hard, too, Chief! Look at me!"
6053,False,"Fingers out of the way... Steady, now..."
6054,False,"If I had two hammers...♪"

6057,False,"How do we fare?"
6058,False,"I'm working hard, I promise!"
6059,False,"No delays─that's what I like to see."
6060,False,"Concentrate...concentrate..."
6061,False,"<sniffle> How they've grown..."
6062,False,"Would be nice to walk these streets together when our work is done..."
6063,False,"Soon, we'll be going our separate ways..."
6064,False,"That's the way!"
6065,False,"I'm taking a nice hot bath soon as my work is done."
6066,False,"Yes, this should more than suffice."
6067,False,"I said <Emphasis>don't</Emphasis> look down!"
6068,False,"The end is in sight! No slacking off till the job is done!"
6069,False,"Fascinating..."
6070,False,"Where do you suppose the chief will go when the work is done...?"
6071,False,"'Twould be my pleasure."
6072,False,"Why, yes...all appears to be in good order."
6073,False,"The chief says not a single spot is to be overlooked."
6074,False,"Oh, thank the heavens! I knew I could count on you!"
6075,False,"Why does no one come to my aid!? Can they not see the pain I'm in!?"
6076,False,"Do not abandon me so! Oh, how I suffer!"
6077,False,"You again. What is it this time?"
6078,False,"This goes here, and─yes, that should be right."
6079,False,"We could have used one of these earlier."
6080,False,"Now for the finishing touch!"
6081,False,"Soon, they shall all be connected..."
6082,False,"They're convenient enough to use, but a real hassle to carry..."
6083,False,"Where does this go again?"
6084,False,"I've been working as hard as anyone! Harder, even! The hardest!"
6085,False,"It is hard to believe our work is almost done..."
6086,False,"Truly, this is my greatest work yet!"
6087,False,"Yes! My muse speaks to me!"
6088,False,"You have done well to come this far!"
6089,False,"Thanks to you, Lord Francel's vision for the Firmament is realized at last!"
6090,False,"You should be proud of yourselves today. Hold your heads high!"

6642,False,"Have you visited that shop over there? The owner certainly has the gift of the gab!"
6643,False,"I could use a drink or three... Somethin' to take the edge off."
6644,False,"I'm pleased our paths could cross once more."
6645,False,"Looking forward to serving you again soon!"
6646,False,"Careful there! What you carry is incredibly fragile."
6647,False,"The numbers you gave me aren't adding up. Are you sure you counted correctly?"
6648,False,"If you spot any nasty-looking vilekin, come straight to me, understand?"
6649,False,"All right, I'd say I've earned myself a quick rest!"
6650,False,"...You aren't looking for help with another experiment, are you?"
6651,False,"Is...there...no end?"
6652,False,"I, er...just remembered that I'm terribly busy. Farewell! "
6653,False,"Do be sure to procure more of the material we discussed."
6654,False,"Those berries are the most tastyfresh gobbietreats!"
6655,False,"I've never seen them before... They aren't dangerous, are they?"
6656,False,"Not at all! Very safe! Safe for uplanders to yummyeat!"
6657,False,"Gobbies never lie. So let us sell our goodygoods!"
6658,False,"Well, don't these look delicious? My, my, that color. How unique!"
6659,False,"They do look good, don't they? It's hard to pick just one."
6660,False,"They're a real treat, I assure you. Buy one─your palate'll thank you for it!"
6661,False,"I'm famished. Shall we grab a bite to eat?"
6662,False,"Yes, let's. At the cafeteria, then? I'm on a rather tight budget..."
6663,False,"I could smell this all day long, I could!"
6664,False,"Bring that to the storehouse, would you?"
6665,False,"Very well. The second storehouse, I presume?"
6666,False,"You're telling me. Patrols are more exhausting than they seem."
6667,False,"Never did I think we would have the chance to speak again."
6668,False,"Likewise. It's a miracle we are here at all."
6669,False,"Your patronage is always appreciated. "
6670,False,"Why of course. You've such a fine collection of wares, how could go I to anyone else?"
6671,False,"I have business at Aporia, if you wouldn't mind letting me through."
6672,False,"Why certainly, provided you have the requisite documents."
6673,False,"I was asked to adjust the temperature in here. Apparently, some find it too stuffy. "
6674,False,"I concur. You might want to do something about the humidity, too, while you're at it."
6675,False,"Looks like there's no more fruit fertilizer..."
6676,False,"Could you let them know for me?"
6677,False,"Why, certainly, ribbit!"
6678,False,"Isn't there <Emphasis>something</Emphasis> we can do to further fortify our walls?"
6679,False,"No─at least, not without new materials, there isn't."
6680,False,"What happened to those supplies you ordered a while back?"
6681,False,"Come to think of it, I haven't received them yet."
6682,False,"I ask that you divide the inspection duties amongst yourselves."
6683,False,"I sHaLl BeGiN oVeR tHeRe."
6684,False,"AnD i ShAlL sTaRt ThErE."
6685,False,"Then I'll inspect this section, ribbit!"
6686,False,"Is there such a thing as an end, if there is no beginning? Makes one think."
6687,False,"Its temperament appears to be somewhat more stable, to be sure."
6688,False,"I say we let it loose for a bit, see how it behaves."
6689,False,"It appears to have moss growing on its head..."
6690,False,"Indeed. They must be living in perfect symbiosis. "
6691,False,"Maybe you do, too. Would explain why it's taken such a liking to you."
6692,False,"E-Error c-c-c-code 4014. Unknown m-m-m-malfunction."
6693,False,"Damage to system detected. Attempting to restore."
6694,False,"Well, here's a conundrum: which carrots should we start with?"
6695,False,"I vote philosopher's carrots. They'll keep us light on our feet!"
6696,False,"No, no─iron carrots first. We won't get far without bulging thews!"
6697,False,"What food do you think mankind likes?"
6698,False,"Oh, excellent question... "
6699,False,"Well, carrots, surely."
6700,False,"All right, this water quality won't check itself! Let's get to it."
6701,False,"Visual inspection complete. Status: crystal clear!"
6702,False,"<slurp> Taste inspection complete. Status: delicious!"
6703,False,"<sniff> <sniff> Scent inspection complete. Status: bracing!"
6704,False,"How goes the system change?"
6705,False,"Oh, about as well as can be expected."
6706,False,"Honestly, if it weren't for bad luck, we'd have no luck at all."
6707,False,"You mustn't worry, darling. I am sure he managed to escape, just like we did."
6708,False,"<sniffle> Wh-Where's Daddy? D-Did he...?"
6709,False,"Tell me, where does it hurt?"
6710,False,"My arm. Argh, it's killing me...!"
6711,False,"Oh dear. Well, that isn't good, now is it?"
6712,False,"Help me! Aaah!"
6713,False,"And what of our stores of perishables? What shall we do with them?"
6714,False,"Sell them, that's what. At cost, if we must."
6715,False,"A tad drastic, don't you think? The tavern may yet pay full price."
6716,False,"Here's the cargo you requested, sir."
6717,False,"You're one shipment too early! Take it back."
6718,False,"I'm afraid you have a bit too much cargo for me to collect..."
6719,False,"Indeed. You go and call for help, I'll stay here and keep watch."
6720,False,"I wonder if they've finished with the evaluation yet..."
6721,False,"What's the status of this cargo?"
6722,False,"DoCuMeNtS cUrReNtLy UnDeR rEvIeW. pLeAsE wAiT."
6723,False,"Got any cargo for me to collect?"
6724,False,"Not yet. Come back once I've finished reviewing this load."
6725,False,"Ah, there you are. Do you have a moment?"
6726,False,"For you, madam? I've all the time in the world."
6727,False,"Last Stand-bound, are you? Today's brew was truly exquisite."
6728,False,"Good to know. I will pay them a visit on my way to the Forum."
6729,False,"BoOkShElF iNsPeCtIoN cOmPleTe. PrEsErVaTiOn StAtUs: GoOd."
6730,False,"We've still got enough rations, by the looks of it."
6731,False,"Brought you more supplies, if you've the space for it."
6732,False,"Ah, thank you. Let me see... Oh, terribly sorry, but this belongs over there."
6733,False,"Why, this might actually work."
6734,False,"And where am I to deliver all this to, exactly?"
6735,False,"Ruveydah Fibers, if you wouldn't mind?"
6736,False,"Have anything else which needs delivering?"
6737,False,"Is that meant in jest? Of course there is. All you see here, in fact."
6738,False,"I've your deliveries here."
6739,False,"Ah, excellent. Thank you."
6740,False,"Point me to what next needs delivering, if you would be so kind."
6741,False,"Let's see... Ah yes, these here if you wouldn't mind?"
6742,False,"Still rifling through materials, are you?"
6743,False,"Unfortunately... I'm struggling to find just the right tome."
6744,False,"We'll have to replenish the feed stock..."
6745,False,"There's barely anything left!"
6746,False,"Have the goods I ordered arrived?"
6747,False,"Not yet, I'm afraid."
6748,False,"How unfortunate. I'll check back later, then."
6749,False,"Excuse me. Do you have any digestives?"
6750,False,"We do stock them, but we just sold out. My apologies..."
6751,False,"Spare some extra material?"
6752,False,"You're out already? <sigh> Fine─but be frugal with it."
6753,False,"Be honest: how much of today's lecture did you understand?"
6754,False,"Honestly? Not a word."
6755,False,"You too, eh? Let's hope we fare better in the next one, then."
6756,False,"Right then! I'm off to the High Crucible."
6757,False,"Give my regards to everyone there, won't you?"
6758,False,"No irregularities detected."
6759,False,"Oh... I've forgotten what I've come here to do."
6760,False,"It is as if my mind is drifting further and further away... Slowly, so slowly. "
6761,False,"And where is it you are going, pray tell?"
6762,False,"The Bureau of the Architect, if you must know. I've a highly original concept..."
6763,False,"Don't you even <Emphasis>think</Emphasis> of fertilizing that!"
6764,False,"But my magnum opus!"
6765,False,"I've got the goods."
6766,False,"No wear! Clothes itchy!"
6767,False,"Tiny hippo. ...Must protect."
6768,False,"Look here─just <Emphasis>try</Emphasis> wearin' some, eh?"
6769,False,"I thought I told you to stop following me!"
6770,False,"Over here, big fellow!"
6771,False,"Take aim and blast this fell beast!"
6772,False,"Retreat! Every man for himself!"
6773,False,"He spoke to me! He actually spoke to me!"
6774,False,"It's Alphinaud himself, in the flesh!"
6775,False,"Looks clear..."
6776,False,"I can't feel my hands..."
6777,False,"Got to keep moving!"
6778,False,"I know you're up to no good!"
6779,False,"<gasp>"
6780,False,"Perhaps I lost <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>... "
6781,False,"This way's blocked, too?"
6782,False,"I'm going home, no matter what!"
6783,False,"M-Must have been the wind."
6784,False,"I-Is someone there?"
6785,False,"Th-This can't be... "
6786,False,"So far, so good..."
6787,False,"Is someone there?"
6788,False,"I must be imagining things."
6789,False,"Better catch my breath..."
6790,False,"If those beasts spot me, I'm done for."
6791,False,"I hope my luck holds..."
6792,False,"Got to keep going... They're all depending on me!"
6793,False,"Just a little farther!"
6794,False,"This is it, the final spurt!"
6795,False,"This way. Hurry!"
6796,False,"Mum, I'm coming!"
6797,False,"Please, we have to hurry!"
6798,False,"She's just a little further!"
6799,False,"Over that hill, right?"
6800,False,"This must be the road he mentioned."
6801,False,"If we follow this, it should lead to the station."
6802,False,"Not the easiest surface to run on..."
6803,False,"We'd better not draw attention."
6804,False,"That's the station, I presume."
6805,False,"......"
6806,False,"What're you looking at? This isn't a show!"
6807,False,"Huh...?"
6808,False,"Whaaa...?"
6809,False,"Can't wait to turn this into good coin and treat myself to a drink!"
6810,False,"Hm? Am I hearing things?"
6811,False,"Let's keep following him...while keeping a good distance."
6812,False,"It gets a bit tight from here. We must be wary..."
6813,False,"That one looks like trouble. Must be an accomplice..."
6814,False,"The streets of Radz–at–Han are most colorful, don't you think?"
6815,False,"We must find whatever evidence we can and help that poor woman."
6816,False,"Bweee!"
6817,False,"Whatever is the meaning of this!? Where is the satrap!?"
6818,False,"I... I saw it! That terrible beast..."
6819,False,"By the gods! Is everyone all right?"
6820,False,"We escaped somehow, but... What in heavens' name is happening to our fair city!?"
6821,False,"Surely the satrap will offer his wisdom and guidance to us..."
6822,False,"The density, however..."
6823,False,"When you put it that way..."
6824,False,"Will so much dust not cause respiratory problems?"
6825,False,"It's fine to admit you're scared, you know?"
6826,False,"In the long run, however, most of you won't die!"
6827,False,"That estimate seems accurate to me..."
6828,False,"Mew!"
6829,False,"Mew, mew? Mew!"
6830,False,"<chitter> <chitter> Hee!"
6831,False,"<chitter> Hee?"

6834,False,"<blip> <bloop>"
6835,False,""
6836,False,"That should do it."
6837,False,"Are you quite certain?"
6838,False,"Just look at the size of it!"
6839,False,"It's not the size..."
6840,False,"I just adore this stained glass piece."
6841,False,"Such amazing detail!"
6842,False,"Is “fair fortune” any good?"
6843,False,"Er, what did it say again?"
6844,False,"Probably?"
6845,False,"Says I should find me's a scuffle."
6846,False,"R-Rabbits are the theme this year!?"
6847,False,"What a curious custom,
this Heavensturn business."
6848,False,"Pay me lyin' whoreson o' a man a visit, then."
6849,False,"You've tried five times already!"
6850,False,"Must...get...great...fortune..."
6851,False,"Mayhap I'll draw a lot myself..."
6852,False,"I demand we be friends!"
6853,False,"<sigh> Because of your fortune?"
6854,False,"They certainly seem to be enjoying themselves."
6855,False,"Hmm... More salt, maybe?"
6856,False,"Nothin' like a good scrub, eh?"
6857,False,"Grub's fresh!"
6858,False,"Work's been pickin' up recently."
6859,False,"Glad tidings indeed!"
6860,False,"Hmm..."
6861,False,"Can't we do somethin' 'bout this?"
6862,False,"Hallo, chums."
6863,False,"Hallo!"
6864,False,"How's it rollin'?"
6865,False,"What do you reckon we do with this, eh?"
6866,False,"Whatever the boss wants!"
6867,False,"I wonder what she's got in mind... Wanna ask?"
6868,False,"Open wide! Here comes another!"
6869,False,"Oooh, now <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> a big mess."
6870,False,"There's a good hippo... You rest up, alright?"
6871,False,"We've found all the treasure, then?"
6872,False,"What is this place?"
6873,False,"A hidden room within a hidden vault... "
6874,False,"Hmmm, a fitting sentinel..."
6875,False,"How about some hamsa skewers, sir?"
6876,False,"How many fish is that fellow plannin' to eat...?"
6877,False,"No, no! Fish! Bring me more fish!"
6878,False,"You alright on parts there?"
6879,False,"That looks right...right?"
6880,False,"Hey! Mind yourself, eh!?"
6881,False,"Sisters bury me─I'm laaaaaate!"
6882,False,"So far, so good! Thanks!"
6883,False,"So the difficult course starts from there, eh?"
6884,False,"Congratulations!"
6885,False,"You're something else!"
6886,False,"Well done!"
6887,False,"<gulp> G-Gotta time it just right..."
6888,False,"N-No, oh please no! I-I can't swim!"
6889,False,"Looks awfully shallow down there..."
6890,False,"Just a little further..."
6891,False,"I can do this! I've come this far after all!"
6892,False,"O-Okay, I'm ready to climb! I'll start aaany minute now..."
6893,False,"The Eorzean Nimble Warrior course starts here!"

6898,False,"The water feels great after those explosions!"
6899,False,"Let's go, Porom!"
6900,False,"Like I need <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> to tell me that, Palom!"
6901,False,"Well? Shall we give the new circuit a try?"
6902,False,"I say we do it!"

6911,False,"Why do I feel as if stalked by a slavering beast..."
6912,False,"<gulp> I wouldn't mind a bite of that..."
6913,False,"When Khloe grows up, Khloe's gonna challenge the course too!"
6914,False,"Me too, me too!"
6915,False,"I think I'll just watch from afar..."
6916,False,"I'll show everyone what the Maelstrom's made of!"
6917,False,"It'll take more than water to scare the Flames! ...It's not cold, is it?"
6918,False,"No turning back...not with the Adders' honor on the line!"
6919,False,"<squeal>"
6920,False,"How was it cooperating with others to craft explosives?"
6921,False,"Very fun─good, interesting, fun!"
6922,False,"'Tis absolutely sweltering─would that I had a cold drink."
6923,False,"Somethin' oddly cute about these water bombs..."
6924,False,"Well I'll be, didn't realize the course ain't the only attraction 'ere."
6925,False,"Kupopo! Seems like everyone's having a good time, kupo!"
6926,False,"Is that Ba Go? Did he come to play?"
6927,False,"Soon, it shall be my turn!"
6928,False,"I don't understand...why not just ssswim?"

6945,False,"The letter said that the duel was to take place here."
6946,False,"...Yet it would seem my opponent is nowhere to be seen."
6947,False,"Anyhow, I have no time for this foolery. I will be on my way at once."
6948,False,"Why, the Gold Saucer's every bit as wonderful as I imagined─more so, even!"
6949,False,"Sparklies! So many sparklies!"
6950,False,"I wonder what varieties of pudding they serve in this place?"
6951,False,"Well an' good to follow your heart─just don't follow it off a cliff."
6952,False,"“Don't follow heart off cliff”... Got it, sir!"
6953,False,"Oh, the places I want to see!"
6954,False,"Nothing beats a hot bath after─what's this?"

6960,False,"Gents, I've a feeling today's our day."
6961,False,"To the Gold Saucer! <Emphasis>This</Emphasis> time, the Cactpot is ours!"
6962,False,"I daresay we have passed the trial."
6963,False,"Let us head back for now."
6964,False,"Coming here together feels like a dream."
6965,False,"Then let neither of us wake, my darling."
6966,False,"That costume there! I helped design it, you know."
6967,False,"That's incredible, Taggy!"

7625,False,"Ahhh, that's the stuff!"
7626,False,"Nothing quite as relaxing as a cup of coffee."
7627,False,"It certainly has a lovely aroma..."
7628,False,"I daresay mezcal may
sell well as an export..."
7629,False,"Not if we drink it all first."
7630,False,"So what do you say?
It's a good deal, isn't it?"
7631,False,"Lower it a few pel

7667,False,"For a blessing, well."
7668,False,"Whew..."
7669,False,"What a beauty..."
7670,False,"How fares your new Everkeep assignment?"
7671,False,"Wait─we're one short? I'll check the storehouse..."
7672,False,"Everything looks to be accounted for..."
7673,False,"Could I interest anyone in a light meal?"
7674,False,"That would be wonderful, thank you!"
7675,False,"Let me just finish telling this story first."
7676,False,"Of course, sweetheart. I'll see you inside."
7677,False,"Any problems with the machinery?"
7678,False,"Everything looks to be stable, sir!"

7681,False,"What'll you make next?"
7682,False,"I haven't decided yet."
7683,False,"My, that's not like you. If you need any ideas, I'm full of them!"
7684,False,"Let's see... Should I put this here?"
7685,False,"Hey, is this the right box?"
7686,False,"It's the wrong one─check the label!"
7687,False,"Huh? Are you sure?"
7688,False,"There's a list in the storeroom. I suggest you read it closely."
7689,False,"A great catch requires great patience."

7725,False,"He should be awake by now..."
7726,False,"I can barely keep my eyes open... Hmm... Time for a short nap."
7727,False,"It's time to get to work!"
7728,False,"All right, all right. I'll be there soon!"
7729,False,"Now, the best trap to catch fish is..."

7735,False,"Again!? You always lose them!"
7736,False,"The old boxes were replaced with new ones. Your twinklestones might be in a yellow one."
7737,False,"Oh, thank you, thank you! I will look!"
7738,False,"Oh, happyfeels! I found my twinklestones!"

7750,False,"What will I catch today?"
7751,False,"Gazing at the rivers usually sets my mind at ease, but during the storm they were a nightmare..."
7752,False,"I know what you mean. The flooding waters were a chilling sight."
7753,False,"Are these the goods you were talking about?"
7754,False,"No! The crate I'm looking for is much bigger!"
7755,False,"You're serious, aren't you? Well, I'll be back then..."
7756,False,"My son struggles to command the wind."
7757,False,"Where shall we strike our next deal, I wonder? What do you think?"

7764,False,"Lightning levels seem normal. All clear."
7765,False,"Remind me, where do we send the ore shipments?"

7772,False,"Is this all the scrap we're bringing to Everkeep?"

7775,False,"Conversion rate looks normal."
7776,False,"That's it...
Grow nice and tasty for me..."

Lots of tarps."
