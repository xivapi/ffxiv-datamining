hear me, your humble admirer?"

I can see the future in it!"
3774,False,"Here's a list for next time."
3775,False,"Do you think our friends in
Namai will come again?"
3776,False,"I'm the lord of all Doma!"
3777,False,"Hien...
I've found you at last..."
3778,False,"Ugh, my aching neck..."
3779,False,"Ready for your next task?"

We'll need more workers..."
3783,False,"Fifteen...sixteen..."
3784,False,"Help!
I can't hold on!"
3785,False,"I sweep and I sweep...
Still dirt."
3786,False,"Another crate here for you."
3787,False,"Right. Put it down
with the others."
3788,False,"All clear on the docks!"
3789,False,"Master Tsuranuki says
he isn't hungry."
3790,False,"He needs to eat.
I'll take a bowl over myself."
3791,False,"Now, where did...
Ugh, I've looked everywhere!"
3792,False,"I'll get to it, then."

And maybe a secret spice
or two."

3802,False,"These salt fleas will
suck the poor girl dry!"
3803,False,"I sssee...
I shall have some more delivered."
3804,False,"A swarm of tracer antlions
is approaching from the north!"
3805,False,"Then you'd better
round up some men
and take care of it!"
3806,False,"We are eager
to prove ourssselves."
3807,False,"Perhaps we should
ask for something less
dangerous this time?"
3808,False,"Surely you don't need
those cast-off skins?
Name your price!"
3809,False,"Are you in need of provisions?"
3810,False,"We've got enough food,
but we're running low on arak!"
3811,False,"Understood!"
3812,False,"A marid eats as much
in a day as five chocobos
do in a sennight."
3813,False,"They say the best salt's
that what's been harvested
by hand...er, rake."
3814,False,"They seem to be doing
just fine without my help."
3815,False,"You see anything, you
either kill it or you run─
just not in this direction."
3816,False,"I can put an arrow in the
eye of a yabby from a
hundred paces...give or

3817,False,"If I find you've been cutting
Master Lolorito's salt with
chalk again..."

I'll rake from dawn till dusk!"

finer than Saltery salt,
and the Bismarck must
have the finest!"

chocobos. I don't fancy
carrying a sack of salt all
the way back to Gridania..."

Go on, have a taste!"

And production has increased tenfold!"

working, it's a matter of
expanding operations..."
3834,False,"I'm sure we can find
work for them all..."
3835,False,"Now we've more hands than
we know what to do with!"

wrong! Nothing!"

your nosiness."

3854,False,"Fine! See what happens!"
3855,False,"Leave the materials here?"
3856,False,"Aye, right there's fine!"
3857,False,"I can't wait to see what it
looks like when it's finished!"
3858,False,"Wonder what they're
going to do with it..."

3860,False,"Give me a moment!"
3861,False,"Where did I leave
that ledger...?"
3862,False,"(Don't...don't mind
me over here... Ugh...)"
3863,False,"Then what would you like
us to purchase instead?"
3864,False,"That ought to suffice for now."
3865,False,"Looks like we've still
got plenty of spices."
3866,False,"Very good, very good..."
3867,False,"Hmm... Thought we had more
around here somewhere..."
3868,False,"I don't think we've got enough
vegetables to last the week."
3869,False,"Let Kozakura know.
She'll take care of it."
3870,False,"Everything is accounted for.
I triple-checked."
3871,False,"Including the materials
for Master Tsuranuki?"
3872,False,"...Perhaps I should check again."
3873,False,"Perhaps you should."
3874,False,"I come bearing gifts!"
3875,False,"Any luck?"
3876,False,"I've got a good feeling..."
3877,False,"Something took the bait!"
3878,False,"Oho!"
3879,False,"A marvelous catch!"
3880,False,"Let's see what else is biting!"
3881,False,"Reeled it in too quickly...?"
3882,False,"Don't give up so easily!"
3883,False,"...Is this upside down?"
3884,False,"Need anything?"
3885,False,"Might could do with
a few more boards!"
3886,False,"I'll see what I can do."
3887,False,"Smiths need more boards─"
3888,False,"It's time to go!"
3889,False,"Can't we stay another night?"
3890,False,"No! We didn't come
all the way here to
laze about!"
3891,False,"But we might never
be able to sleep on
such comfy beds again!"
3892,False,"I'll blame you if
someone else claims those
marks before we do!"
3893,False,"One more night!
That's all I ask!"
3894,False,"Kweh!"
3895,False,"We're spreading
ourselves too thin..."
3896,False,"Tell me, does this hurt?"
3897,False,"Ah! Only when you
poke it like that!"
3898,False,"That means you're
on the mend."
3899,False,"Be more careful in future.
You're no good to us dead."
3900,False,"Argh! My stomach!"
3901,False,"You shouldn't eat
wild berries. They
could be poisonous!"
3902,False,"Do it again, and I'll
cut you open and
dig them out myself!"
3903,False,"I could while away the hours,
Liftin' bags of salt and flour,
If I only had a crane.♪"
3904,False,"Winching her up, then!
Stand clear!"
3905,False,"The buckets are full!"

3912,False,"Heh, pretty rare for a rat
to live long enough─"
3913,False,"Rat? Rat!?
I am an otter, good sir!"

crystal right this instant!"

Genbu will curse you for
ten thousand years!"

3922,False,"Of course not!
They didn't before,
so why would they now!?"

I said hello..."

Interested?"
3925,False,"Such serenity, such peace..."

3927,False,"I no longer fear for my soul.
My thanks to you..."
3928,False,"Hehe, you're funny!"
3929,False,"Do you have any more medicine?"
3930,False,"It's getting harder to come by.
You'll have to pay double."
3931,False,"Didn't think you'd come back,
given your condition..."
3932,False,"...Was curious, is all."
3933,False,"Never hurts to have an extra set of eyes looking over the hull!"
3934,False,"Need to get this
tub patched up..."
3935,False,"Look at you, boy.
Life on the sea has
made you strong..."
3936,False,"Mother, I...
I never thought
I'd see you again."
3937,False,"We hardly dared hope!
Thank the kami you're alive..."
3938,False,"Who's your friend?
A new auspice?"
3939,False,"Meow!♪"
3940,False,"Oh him? He's just some
cat that wandered in."
3941,False,"Wandered in? Past the
wards and guards and
<Emphasis>liquid hot magma</Emphasis>!?"

3943,False,""
3944,False,"Is it appropriate to
grab him like that?"

I can still carry more."
3947,False,"I could use a dozen more like you..."
3948,False,"That's it, my friends.
Now lift your knees higher."
3949,False,"You did it!
You slew the meownster!"
3950,False,"Don't forget to carve
a scale or two off his hide."
3951,False,"Tell me more of how you
fractured that man's skull!"
3952,False,"Time for a break? Yes, yes?"
3953,False,"No Namazu may wield a
bow without supervision."
3954,False,"I almost made it up
onto the horse today!"
3955,False,"Mmm, fish... Yes, yes..."

My fins hurt too!"

4012,False,"Pirates lose to ninjas?
Over my dead body!"
4013,False,"I can't do it... I can't do it!"
4014,False,"It all hangs on this final stage..."
4015,False,"How could I shame myself so
in front of my beloved?"

4026,False,"There's always time for squats!"
4027,False,"In the way?
No, not at all!"

4035,False,"I mustn't give in to
my fear next time...
