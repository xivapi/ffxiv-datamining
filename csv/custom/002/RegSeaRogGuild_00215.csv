1,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_Q1_010","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_A1_011","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_A1_012","Why fight with daggers?"
4,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_A1_013","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_020","Eh? What do <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> do here? I'm Captain Jacke─I'm the bleedin' guildmaster."
6,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_021","I s'pose I don't much look the part, but that's more to me advantage in our line o' work. Looks aside, ye'll not find a stauncher advocate o' the code in this room."
7,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_022","It was a rogue o' similar conviction what saved me from drownin' in the sludge o' the underworld. He showed me a light in the darkmans, an' the guild's been me home ever since..."
8,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_030","Why not a sword, or an axe? Well, I may've explained this a time o' two before, but shortblades are simply the weapons what work best for scraps in the shadows."
9,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_031","They're light enough to run with, easily concealed, an' don't get caught on all the bloody guide ropes an' shippin' crates what fair litter this city."
10,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_032","Yer smaller stabbers're also quick to coat with poison, an' lend 'emselves well to a rogue's swift an' flowin' style o' fightin'."
11,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_033","If yer interested in studyin' up more on yer dance steps, then go have a prattle with old Bochard. But I warn ye: he'll talk yer bloody wattles off if ye let him!"
12,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_040","Let's get after the rest o' them Jolly Merchants, eh? ...Well, what're ye waitin' for? Ye get a hole in yer beater case, or was there sumfin' else what had ye bothered...?"
13,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_041","We ain't done with them Jolly Merchants yet. Get yer arse back to Aleport, an' we'll get on with the job."
14,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_050","Ho there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! The shadows draw ye back in, did they?"
15,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_060","Back from trainin' with them Domans, are ye? There's a steel in ye I've not seen afore... I've a feelin' the answer is “nay,” but was there aught ol' Jacke could do for ye?"
16,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_061","What's this I hear about ye bein' set up for a fall in Ul'dah? If ye need a place to practice yer hidin', the shadows're always thick here in the Sisters. Besides, there ain't no cull as'll be gettin' past ol' Lonny without his say-so."
17,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_062","Ain't it great that ye can show yer face in the lightmans again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Now, yer free to creep about in the darkmans fer the sake o' the realm."
18,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_Q1_070","What will you ask?"
19,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_A1_071","How fare the Dutiful Sisters?"
20,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_A1_072","Why fight with daggers?"
21,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_A1_073","Nothing."
22,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_080","Hah! We Sisters're still deeply devoted to upholdin' the code─the job is still the job."
23,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_081","Limsa's underbelly's been bloody quiet, though. After we dealt with Aisibhir an' his cronies, the Reformist faction fell to bits. The Bloody Executioners are still squabblin' over the leader's chair, but I'd put me coin on Captain Moenskaet to take the helm."
24,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_082","As for the 'Jackets, well, we've not heard a peep from the shrew, neither. Maybe she's realized we rogues ain't the wicked coves she thought we was, eh?"
25,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_083","...What about you, then, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? One o' these days I'll have to round up Underfoot an' the Stray, an' drag you buggers out for that victory pint!"
26,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_090","I'm pleased to report I handed the fake scroll back to the Krakens, an' Carvallain was none the wiser. Word has it that a wealthy collector even bought it off him for a fair bit o' blunt."
27,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_091","Hard to imagine that musty ol' thing hanging up in some rich cove's study, but there's no accountin' for taste, eh? What would that Karasu think to hear his forgery's now a bleedin' work o' art."
28,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_092","Meanwhile, Underfoot and the Stray can't stop yammerin' about raw fish an' bathhouses. Seems they had a right rum time in Kugane while we were out there gettin' our daddles dirty."
29,"TEXT_REGSEAROGGUILD_00215_JACKE_093","But enough about us, how do <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> bloody fare o' late? An' when are we goin' out for that victory pint? Ye can even bring along dreary ol' Oboro─if a flagon o' Baderon's finest bingo can't put a smile on that lad's face, I don't know what could."
