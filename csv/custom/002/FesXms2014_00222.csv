The festival spans the entire realm of Eorzea, and we have little helpers stationed in the cities of Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS2014_00222_GUIDEXMS2014_000_011","If you are inquiring as to the specifics of our duties, well, I shall be happy to explain those as well. It all starts with the children, who compose a special letter to the goddess Nymeia, the Spinner, and place it under the boughs of a Starlight sentinel."
10,"TEXT_FESXMS2014_00222_GUIDEXMS2014_000_012","A little helper, dressed in seasonal garb, will then collect a youngling's message, and personally deliver a present to the eagerly awaiting child."

12,"TEXT_FESXMS2014_00222_GUIDEXMS2014_000_020","The Starlight Celebration can be traced back to ancient Ishgard. Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas."
13,"TEXT_FESXMS2014_00222_GUIDEXMS2014_000_021","Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms."
14,"TEXT_FESXMS2014_00222_GUIDEXMS2014_000_022","Owing to their generosity, the children survived the winter and lived to pay forward the kindness they had received. The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born."
15,"TEXT_FESXMS2014_00222_GUIDEXMS2014_000_023","Over the years, the celebration has undergone gradual changes. The snowy-bearded captain of the kind-hearted knights has become known as the “Saint of Nymeia,” and children believe that he delivers their hopes and prayers directly to the goddess Herself."
16,"TEXT_FESXMS2014_00222_GUIDEXMS2014_000_024","Similarly, his red-jacketed knights have become the “saint's little helpers.” They are particularly beloved by the younglings, for it is their role to bring gifts to every child who sends a prayer to the Spinner."
