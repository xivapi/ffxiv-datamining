1,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_001","I hope Sid feels better soon, kupo... On the bright side, he doesn't seem nearly as grim and dark as I remember! Except when he's talking about punching moogles, that is."
2,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_002","Ah, no Sid or Rielle today? Just you, kupo? That's a shame. Anyway, I am still the second-most well-informed moogle here, so if you have questions, ask away!"

7,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_010","Why, I'm in charge of guarding the entrance to Moghome! If I see any of the many malicious monsters get too close, or if anything else is even slightly out of the ordinary, it's my duty to report straight to Chieftain Moglin or the Pomguard, kupo!"

That's why, next to Chieftain Moglin, I'm the second-most well-informed moogle in all of Moghome!"
9,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_012","If anything is troubling you, or you have any questions, chances are I'll be able to help. We won't be hiding or running away anymore, kupo!"
10,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_020","As the name implies, Moghome is where us moogles make our homes! It lies at the summit of the towering mountain Sohm Al. Just how high is Sohm Al, you ask? Well, if you must know, you're free to climb down yourself and see!"
11,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_021","Sometimes a distant dragon howl will awaken us in the night, or an impolite monster might chase us around, but besides that, I'd say we have it pretty good living here above the clouds, kupo!"
