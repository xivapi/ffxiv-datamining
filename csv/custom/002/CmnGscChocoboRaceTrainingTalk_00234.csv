3,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A2_000_1","What are the benefits of training each attribute?"
4,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A4_000_1","What are hereditary and acquired abilities?"
5,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A3_000_1","When should I retire my race chocobo?"

7,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A1_000_01","As your chocobo gains experience, it will naturally grow stronger. However, should you wish to develop a given attribute, it would behoove you to consider training."
8,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A1_000_02","Do bear in mind that training can be rather taxing─both physically and mentally. Eventually, your chocobo will receive no benefit from it."
9,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A1_000_03","This condition is not permanent, of course. Given time and experience, your chocobo will once more grow receptive to training."
10,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A1_000_04","As for feed, which is an essential component of any training session─a selection of quality blends can be purchased from our tack & feed trader."
11,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A2_000_01","An excellent question, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>. Would that every jockey took the time to learn such essential information."

18,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A4_000_2","As their names indicate, the main difference between hereditary and acquired abilities is the manner in which chocobos obtain them."
19,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A4_000_3","If a chocobo is skilled with an ability, then there is a possibility that that chocobo's offspring will inherit said ability."
20,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A4_000_4","These hereditary abilities can prove to be invaluable assets, and a jockey would do well to take note of any <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> chocobo possesses."
21,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A4_000_5","If you are particularly ambitious, you might even consider arranging a covering to breed a fledgling with an ability of your choosing. Katering at Moogle's Gift Mounts could tell you more...but I digress."
22,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A4_000_6","In contrast, acquired abilities are a far more simple matter. A qualified trainer such as myself can─with the requisite manual─simply teach these abilities to your chocobo, provided that your chocobo has not already learned another ability in this manner."
23,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDEMENU_A4_000_7","I can, of course, unteach these abilities as well. You need only furnish me with a vial of lethe water, which our tack & feed trader can provide."
24,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A3_000_01","Chocobos cannot live this life forever. If you judge that yours has reached its full potential, you may wish to consider retirement."
25,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A3_000_02","Be warned that, once retired, a race chocobo cannot be re-registered. It is not a decision to be made lightly."
26,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A3_000_03","Nevertheless, rather than an end, I would encourage you to think of retirement as a new beginning."
27,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A3_000_04","After all, if you choose to arrange a covering for your retired chocobo, you may be blessed with a fledgling strong enough to carry on its parents' legacy─or surpass it!"
28,"TEXT_CMNGSCCHOCOBORACETRAININGTALK_00234_GUIDE_A3_000_05","Once retired, chocobos can no longer participate in sanctioned chocobo races.
