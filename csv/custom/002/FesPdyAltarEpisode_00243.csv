19,"TEXT_FESPDYALTAREPISODE_00243_GUIDEPDY2015_000_023","Upon learning of his daughter's disappearance, the sultan was stricken with panic. He summoned the palace guard─down to the last man─and ordered them to tear the city apart to see that no harm befell his precious princess."
20,"TEXT_FESPDYALTAREPISODE_00243_GUIDEPDY2015_000_024","...And tear the city apart they did. The poor miller whose daughter assisted the princess in her escape saw his house nigh ripped from the ground, while the family was threatened with imprisonment and worse."
21,"TEXT_FESPDYALTAREPISODE_00243_GUIDEPDY2015_000_025","To the good fortune of all, Princess Edvya was soon found just outside the palace walls.
