2,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_Q1_000_000","What will you do?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_A1_000_003","Talk."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_100","Though the light-heavyweight division is the lowest tier of the championship, you surprised one and all by rising up as champion without the use of feral souls."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_101","And you didn't stop there. When former heavyweight fighter Wicked Thunder unexpectedly appeared to challenge you, you bested her as well. Never have we seen such drama at the Arcadion!"
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_102","Like most others, I watched your matches at the edge of my seat, but I've been most keen to hear your firsthand account. Pray spare no detail!"
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_103","Hm-hm! Your words have provided me with insight and inspiration both! With a few embellishments, I believe I can produce a story that will grip the reader from start to finish!"
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_Q1_100_100","What will you say?"
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_A1_100_100","Embellishments...?"
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_A2_100_100","You're not going to tell it as it happened?"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_104","Lest you misunderstand, my works are not intended to be accurate records of events. In the name of a good story, I may take some liberties with certain details."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_105","For example...what if Black Cat had brought even deadlier techniques to bear against you?"
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_106","Or if Honey B. Lovely, whose sweet facade concealed a terrible temper, had become further enraged?"
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_107","What sort of carnage might have unfolded if the Brute Bomber had stooped to lower lows to seize victory?"
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_108","And last but not least, what if Wicked Thunder refused to retreat, resolving instead to fight on?"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_109","In such a manner do I let my mind wander when I produce my works. And this time, I'm confident that I have a best seller on my hands!"
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_110","I thank you for taking the time to share your account with me. I wish you continued success in the arena!"
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_200","If you've a moment, I would love to hear your firsthand account of your cruiserweight matches. You impressed tremendously as before, overcoming one veteran fighter after the next to become champion."
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_201","My hands were clammy with sweat as I watched your encounter with the Brute Abombinator, and to remember your triumph over the Howling Blade sends a shiver down my spine!"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_202","Even so, my experiences as a spectator cannot compare to those you lived, and I yearn to hear the visceral particulars from you. Pray spare no detail!"
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_203","Hm-hm, your words have stoked the fires of my imagination! Yes, I believe I can produce evocative new cartoons that pale not even next to Sugar Riot's works!"
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_204","For instance...what if your dance battle against Dancing Green had reached a higher fever pitch?"
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_205","Or if the rambunctious Sugar Riot had allowed her art to run rampant, bringing works out of this world to life?"
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_206","And if the Brute Abombinator's savage onslaught had become savager still, what manner of hellscape might he have created?"
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_207","Finally, what if the Howling Blade had remained standing to unleash the full might of Fenrir?"
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_208","Oh yes, I daresay the next chapter of <Emphasis>The Chronicles of the Unstoppable Upstart</Emphasis> will be a best seller as well!"
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_209","Thank you for taking the time to share your account with me. I look forward to witnessing your future exploits─and hearing about them from you as well, of course!"
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_100_400","I'm afraid I've yet to complete my preparations. Forgive me, but I must ask that you wait a touch longer."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_400","You wish to talk? I could tell you a little more about myself, I suppose..."
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_401","I'm a cartoonist, as you know, and I primarily draw inspiration from the matches at the Arcadion."
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_402","My cartoons enjoy great popularity here in Solution Nine, even if I do say so myself."
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_403","And mark my words, my next series featuring you as the protagonist is guaranteed to be a best seller!"
