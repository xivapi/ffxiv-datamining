10,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_011","They'll enjoy that life of violence for twenty or thirty years before deciding it's time to settle down and bursting into flower. Their duty to the species complete, they wither and die. Or at least, most of them do."
11,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_012","Those with the lustiest of life forces aren't satisfied with perpetuating the species─they want to perpetuate the violence, too. They'll carry on living long after they've flowered, growing ever more dangerous in their dotage. Far as I see it, ending their madness is a mercy."

13,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_021","The Chupacabra is something similar, though the name far predates the sightings of the beast that currently bears it. It was originally given to a creature from a tall tale passed down among seafaring folk: a terror from the lands across the salt that fed on the blood of beasts."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_022","When the sailors caught wind of a devil plying the same, savage trade across Tural, they dredged up the old legend, and the name with it. Main difference is, this new incarnation feeds only on folk. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction─and a hell of a lot scarier, too."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_030","Ugh, <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> thing. Everything about it creeps me out, even the name. It means “wise wood” in the Pelupelu tongue, apparently─on account of it being smart enough to speak. <snort> Quite an achievement for a tree."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_031","Not that you'll get any sense out of it. No, the only thing you're likely to come away with from an encounter with Nechuciho is a couple dozen broken bones. That's if you come away from it at all. You don't want to know how many herders and merchants have ended up as plant food over the years."
17,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_032","And to make matters worse, he's immortal. You cut one of him down, another one springs up to replace him. Don't know whether he's some kind of evil spirit, possessing one tree after another, or if he's more like a fungus, sprouting up over and over again from the same, shared root stock. To be honest, I don't care. All I know is, we're only safe in those short, blessed periods when the “wise wood” is “dead wood.”"

Until, that is, their numbers grow too large, at which point a new queen is born, who leads half the citizenry on a crusade to find a new home."
19,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_041","These crusades can go on for malms and malms until they finally plant their flag in foreign lands, claiming them for their own. I hear it said that some swarms have even made it across the salt."
