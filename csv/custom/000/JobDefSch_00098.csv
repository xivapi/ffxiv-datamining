1,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_011","The doctrine of overwhelming force that many follow has not always been successful, you see. Ancient Nym, in particular, is said to have defended itself from numerous invasions, despite possessing only a token force of mariners and mages."
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_012","Indeed, I believe there is much we can learn by studying the military tactics of old. I hope one day to persuade my brethren of this fact, so that we might grow as an organization."
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_000","The Nymian tablets contain a veritable wealth of knowledge. Deciphering the remaining text may take an eternity─but even if it does, it will be time well spent."

6,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A1_000_002","What is a scholar?"
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A1_000_003","Nothing."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_020","In that age of wonders more than fifteen hundred years ago, when rival nations brought earth-shattering magicks to bear against one another, scholars were instrumental in ensuring the survival of Nym."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_021","Though they were far fewer in number relative to the mariners, it is clear that these mages formed the backbone of the Nymian military."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_022","One might describe their role as one which provides support, but that does not adequately describe their capabilities, as far as I am concerned."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_023","Powerful restorative and enhancing magicks, well, those were hardly unusual in that day and age."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_024","No, what set scholars apart was both the strength of their magicks, and the manner in which they employed them."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_025","Aye, I speak of the faeries, those otherworldly creatures which the scholars learned to bind and control. Just how they managed to do so I have yet to discover, but I can only surmise that it required tremendous research and experimentation."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_026","I suppose that is why I have taken to calling these mages “scholars,” though I confess that the description might seem incongruous with their military duties. "
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_030","Such a pleasure to see you again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I trust you and Lily have had many a grand adventure since last we spoke?"
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_031","My friend, how fare you? I have devoted myself heart and soul to training in my every waking hour─and dreaming of what I have learned every night."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_032","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, Sergeant Tolga is a stern taskmaster. Why, I feel I may keel over at any second..."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_033","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! To what do I owe the immense pleasure of seeing my fellow marine today?"
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_Q2_000_1","What will you ask?"
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A2_000_1","How goes your research?"
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A2_000_2","What is a scholar?"
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A2_000_3","Nothing."
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_100","Quite well, and in large part thanks to you. Fighting by your side was an enlightening experience, to say the least."
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_101","However, as is often the case in academic research, it is the unexpected discoveries which prove the most fascinating. I must confess that I am tempted to broaden the scope of my studies. But that is a conversation for another day."
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_103","All I discovered in our last round of adventures has aided in my growth. I became the marauder I am today thanks to my long study of Nymian tactics and meeting you."
26,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_104","But all we have learned pales in comparison to what Surito Carito can yet teach us. This is a priceless opportunity to discover the secrets of Nym thought lost to the millennia, and to grow from their study."
27,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_105","Sergeant Tolga is a masterful teacher, though “grueling” best describes his particular technique. But where there is no pain, there is nothing to be gained."
28,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_106","And what I have gained, my friend! The sergeant saw battle back when Nym warred with Mhach, and his experience shows in his instruction. Why, he has taught me more in a day than I could have learned from a tablet in a moon!"
29,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_107","I am continuing to train under Sergeant Tolga. Though he has recognized I am worthy of the Royal Marines, he sees that I have not yet awakened to my full potential. However, I can no longer focus solely on my own progress."
30,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_108","There are many members of the Marauders' Guild who wish to learn Nymian techniques. They must be taught to defend the defenseless, and you and I must lead by example. To victory, my friend─come hells or high water."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_Q3_000_1","What will you ask?"
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A3_000_2","How are things going with the Royal Marines?"
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A3_000_3","How is Setoto?"
34,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A3_000_4","What is a scholar?"
35,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_A3_000_5","Nothing."
36,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_200","She has never been better! Her good health and smile are quite possibly the Royal Marines' biggest victory to date. Though, I suppose Landenel and Setoto's father also deserve some of that credit."
37,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_201","Truly, a parent's love knows no bounds. Mayhap if I ever come to sire children, I will understand what spurred him to make such a great sacrifice."
38,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_202","I suppose what you really want to know is if Setoto ever joined the Royal Marines? While yet to become an official member, she has been training with me every day. I wanted to invite you to join us, but she insists that she requires my full attention to improve."
39,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_203","Between my rigorous training regimen and her eagerness to learn, she is certain to become a proper marine in next to no time!"

41,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_100_110","Hmmm... Now that we are working with Surito Carito, mayhap a review would not go amiss. However, I can scarce imagine I will tell you aught you did not know already..."
42,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_200_110","Surely, by now you know far more about this subject than I do. <sigh> If you truly wish to hear it again, however, I shall not begrudge you an explanation."

47,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_115","Aye, I speak of the faeries, those otherworldly creatures which the scholars learned to bind and control."
48,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_116","However, as we saw firsthand on several occasions, that control is not absolute. And praise the Twelve that it is not, or we might have never learned the true nature of tonberries!"
49,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_117","Alas, I fear that revelation will do little to change how the tortured souls are treated. So long as the rancor drives the tonberries to violence, the people of Vylbrand will have no choice but to defend themselves..."
