15,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_045","Aye, I have heard of Sanson's capture. Never before have I seen Guydelot distressed so. He truly cares for his friend, and suffice it to say I will spare no effort in seeing him rescued."

23,"TEXT_JOBDEFBRD_00094_JEHANTEL_000_150","Though their betters have been less than cooperative, the men and women of the Gods' Quiver show no small amount of interest in your quest for the Ballad of Oblivion."
