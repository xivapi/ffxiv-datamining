1,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_A1_000_2","What is a gladiator?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_010","Well, I don't just stand around gawping, if that's what you're asking. I am Mylla, guildmaster here."
6,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_011","I instruct these would-be warriors on the finer points of swordsmanship. If you like, I could teach you a thing or two as well, though I can't promise to be gentle."
7,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_012","You'll be bruised and bloody by the time we're finished, but I guarantee you'll be stronger for it. Observe our training and see for yourself."
8,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_020","Gladiators aspire to become masters of the sword, the most ubiquitous weapon in all of Eorzea."
9,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_021","The sword is a deceptively simple weapon, which is why many take it up to achieve their goals. Wealth, power, love─all seem within reach when duly armed."
10,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_022","A gladiator, however, understands that to live by the sword is not a decision to be taken lightly. To walk upon the bloodsands is to court death, and we must ever be prepared to enter Thal's realm."
11,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_023","But when you stand triumphant in the Coliseum and hear the crowd chanting your name, you feel...immortal."
12,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_024","Of course, victory goes only to those willing to work for it. A gladiator must rigorously train not only to deliver fierce attacks, but also to weather them. Indeed, learning the shield is just as important as learning the sword."
13,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_025","These defensive skills are especially important when fighting alongside allies. In battle, a gladiator is often relied upon to draw the enemy's attention while his weaker allies seize the opportunity to attack."
14,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_026","It is for this reason that gladiators are often considered indispensable in battle, for none are more skilled in the arts of war than we."
15,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_050","Well, if it isn't <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! What wind blows you here?"
16,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_060","It's not every day a famous free paladin darkens our door. To what do we owe the pleasure, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
17,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_070","You are yet welcome here, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Marshal Tarupin made it clear that you were innocent of all charges─not that we needed to be told the truth! No student of mine would dare sully <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> blade with royal blood."
18,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_071","No further need to skulk about, eh? Not that there was much before, but you can hardly accuse someone of murder when the victim is alive and well."
19,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_000","This tournament brings together the realm's finest. If you are to rise above them, nothing less than complete preparation will suffice."
20,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_001","Before your turn comes to step into the arena, I suggest you put what time you have to good use, be it honing your skills or upgrading your gear."
21,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_010","I never doubted that you could win through to the final, but to witness it all unfold was nothing short of awe-inspiring!"
22,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_011","The winner of the Nald group will square off against you for the title, and suffice it to say I intend to be that person."
23,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_012","I shall see to it that a match between us becomes a reality, and I hope that I can count on your support!"
24,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_020","I'm sorry that I could not meet you in the final, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but I've no doubt that you will do our guild proud."
25,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_021","I look forward to seeing you clash with Black Lotus and, needless to say, come away with the win."
26,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_030","I shall see to convincing the organizers to host the final. Until such time as the match is confirmed, take what rest you can. You will need it."
27,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_040","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, always a pleasure. Your Ul Cup victory lit a fire in our members' bellies, and they train like men and women possessed."
28,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_400_050","Aldis hasn't returned..."
29,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_500_000","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, always a pleasure. Whenever you visit, our members train that little bit harder. Funny, that."
30,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"

34,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_100","Your concern for my well-being is touching, albeit unwarranted."
35,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_101","I am fine, the guild is fine, Aldis is─ Oh, who gives a damn how Aldis is?"
36,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_102","More importantly, any time you waste worrying about the affairs of others would be better spent further honing your skills."
37,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_110","The life of a gladiator is never easy, but I cannot complain. Certain members of the guild have achieved greater recognition in recent days, which has led to a surge of applicants."
38,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_111","They are eager to learn, I will grant them that. Yet they struggle to grasp the basics still. For example, the other day I was explaining the concept of eliciting an opponent's enmity. Surely you recall the lesson? It involved shouting at marauders."
39,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_112","One recruit took forever and a day to understand that his words were not enough, and that he needed to motion to himself to achieve the full effect. Even now, I cannot fathom why he struggled so..."

49,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_600_101","Those who remained were largely engaged with keeping the tempered appearing from the towers at bay. For a blessing, we were able to keep casualties to a minimum─proof, if any were needed, of the efficacy of our techniques."
50,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_600_102","As for myself, I understand all too well the importance of constant improvement. With so many talented students, it would be most unbecoming if any were to surpass their guildmaster, and so I maintain a strict training regimen of my own."
