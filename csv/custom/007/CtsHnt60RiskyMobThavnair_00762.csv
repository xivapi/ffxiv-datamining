13,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_010","Ah yes, Iravati. The name is a rather ancient word for a medicinal plant─or so my colleagues among the Arkasodara say."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_011","Evidently, this particular specimen grew inordinately powerful after menacing several alchemists and subsequently downing half the Great Work's supply of potions and elixirs."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_012","The professors of the Studium's Faculty of Medicine were ecstatic to hear of this, and have requested samples to facilitate the study of the effect alchemical potations have on animals. Alas, for various reasons, few are willing to contend with a rampaging gaja."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_020","Thavnair is home to a plethora of rare and unusual fauna, but there is perhaps none so unique as the vajralangula. These creatures use their tails to pluck fruit and wave it about as a means to court mates."
17,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_021","Said three-pronged tail clasped about an amra bears a mighty resemblance to the vajra─a weapon oft depicted alongside local divinities─hence the species's name."
18,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_022","Our naturalists would like to study the aforementioned tail, and require a specimen in its youthful prime as a sample. Naturally, they've gone and set their hearts on a particularly ornery one, and naught else will do..."
19,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_030","Sugriva once led a pack of wolves in the north of Thavnair, within the dense jungle of Vanaspati. By all accounts, he is a truly enormous specimen."
20,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_031","Nevertheless, the previous alpha returned to reclaim his pack and successfully ousted Sugriva, who migrated south. He now wreaks havoc in his exile, and the people want for someone willing to slay the beast."
21,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_032","Fortunately, a professor of biology filed a request for a vibrant pelt the other day, and Sugriva happens to fit the bill. For once, the faculty's timing couldn't be more perfect!"
22,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_040","The Au Ra's flavor of Hannish once used the word “yilan” to mean “snake,” though I fear that fails to capture the─frankly repulsive─image of what the Faculty of Medicine has requested you hunt down."
23,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_041","According to reports from the local naturalists, the creature emits aether from its photophores that crushes its prey into a more diminutive form, the better to swallow it whole. Not pleasant, oh no."

37,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_061","The creature escaped its enclosure some few years ago, and made its way to the frigid Eblan Rime, where the Garleans believed it had perished. Thus it was with great surprise that they discovered the creature had not only adapted to the extreme cold, but begun to propagate itself."

Developed at the Enceladeum, this autonomous, cutting-edge piece of magitek is programmed to ruthlessly slaughter whosoever it determines to be “the enemy.” As you may have guessed from its name, it is not particularly discriminating in said determination."
40,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_071","Nevertheless, the Garleans are one or two steps ahead of Sharlayan when it comes to mechanical engineering, so faculty and students both are champing at the bit to study it."
41,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_072","Given its nature as an unfeeling machine of mass murder, it would be difficult and likely unwise to retrieve in an operational state. However, should it be appropriately dismantled, its parts ought to be sufficiently edifying."
42,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_080","Though researchers in Labyrinthos have pioneered technology capable of controlling the local climate, such control requires an immense amount of variously aspected aether to maintain."

Admittedly, harvesting a bit of bark would require no great expertise...if our subject weren't known to prey on great bears and the like."
