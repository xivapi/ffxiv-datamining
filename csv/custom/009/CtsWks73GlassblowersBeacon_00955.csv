12,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_100_001","Well, let's see. Gleaner by trade. Left home to see the world. Heard about the initiative and fancied the thought of exploring untouched wilds, so here I am."
13,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_200_002","A gleaner's value is in gathering─research samples, in this case─and we go where our skills are in demand. Reckon half the folks here have got a story like mine."
14,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_300_003","The best part? The job's easier than ever out here─no dangerous wildlife! I need only do my work and trust the Loporrits to have everything else well in hand."
15,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_001","I'm told it's the sixth astral body within star system UL-9, three carrots from Etheirys...whatever that means. All I know is it's the first we've managed to reach!"
16,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_002","As you may have heard, much of the star is made of glass, from the aether clouds above to the magma veins below."
17,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_003","The rainbow crystal protects us here, but beyond its reach, the land is pelted with drops of molten glass. Unmanned drones could well be our only means of exploration out there."
18,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_004","Smart choice to build our base here. The cracked ceiling offers protection from the elements but still allows starships in and out."
19,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_005","Supposedly, there are subtle traces around the cavern that suggest it was formed through subterranean heat melting away the interior."
20,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_006","It's hard to block out shard showers with a giant hole in our cover, though, so all the most valuable equipment has been fitted with self-shielding capabilities."
21,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_007","Those rolling hills are covered in vibrant glass plants, and so were named for a glasswork technique which roughly translates to “a thousand flowers.”"
22,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_008","Strange as it sounds, this whole star's so rich in silicon that even the plants are basically made of glass."
23,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_009","What d'you reckon? Bit further down this evolutionary path and mayhap we'll see glass animals? Glass <Emphasis>people</Emphasis>? Can't say as I fancy the thought..."
24,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_010","Sounds like an overpriced drink at the Last Stand, doesn't it? The river's actually named for its soda ash content─an ingredient used to make glass."
25,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_011","Naturally, it's caused quite a stir among the Sharlayans, debating the implications of a world with liquid glass in place of water."
26,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_012","Fortunately, it can be made potable through heavy filtering. If you drank it straight from the source, though...well, I'd be concerned for your organs."
27,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_013","Ah, you mean the pale grey expanse on the western bank of the Soda-lime Float?"
28,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_014","It may look like a beach, but the “sand” is in fact small specks of glass eroded over time from bigger pieces at the bottom of the river."
29,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_015","Oh, but you'd best watch out for the hidden sand pits. Pay attention to the glass at your feet and steer clear if it starts to sink!"
30,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_016","The Rise is a rainbow of travertine terraces formed from small glass ponds. Researchers say the process may well have taken tens of thousands of years."
31,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_017","First the limestone developed, then rain weathered it, and then liquid glass accumulated over it. Gods, can you imagine?"
32,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_018","Most notably, each terrace color yields vastly different materials for harvesting! Well...notable if you're a gleaner, anyroad."
33,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_019","That there's an unfathomably deep crevasse littered with what look like massive marbles. The broken ones often hold an entire lake's worth of water."
34,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_020","They say it was once a volcanic crater that collapsed, sending nearby spherical formations rolling into it. Not the most stable of environs on this star, eh?"
35,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_021","Much of its topography can be seen from the surface, but if you'd prefer, our specially designed cranes can help you get a closer look in there."
36,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_022","Dodgy place, that. Like the mouth of a volcano, it spews smoke from the red-hot molten glass guttering within."
37,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_023","Phaenna's geothermal reservoirs are highly active, see─liquefying pockets of glass minerals on the surface and keeping the scenery in constant flux."
38,"TEXT_CTSWKS73GLASSBLOWERSBEACON_00955_JAROMIR_000_024","That said, I'm told it would take centuries for a new crater to form through eruption, so we've nothing to worry about...although the Loporrits might, I s'pose."
