1,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_001","Should you have anything you wish to discuss, I shall be happy to oblige. I have nothing left to hide, after all!"
2,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_Q1_000_000","What will you ask about?"
3,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_A1_000_001","How fares the business?"
4,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_A1_000_002","What is the president's story?"
5,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_A1_000_003","Can you tell me more about the Lindwurm?"
6,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_A1_000_004","Nothing."
7,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_100","Oh, quite well, my friend. Contrary to our initial fears, the audience has only grown since we ended the use of feral souls. Each day, nigh every seat in the house is sold out!"
8,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_101","This unprecedented success, we of course owe to you. Your nail-biting bouts gave the people a taste of the thrills that unenhanced battles have to offer."
9,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_102","Even now, in this Arcadion reborn, fighters vie for victory, seeking to ascend as the first grand champion!"
10,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_200","As you know, the president traced his lineage to Lindblum. His ancestor was a noble of that lost kingdom, and a patron of the theatrical arts."
11,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_201","And it seems the president inherited his forebear's passion. For in a single generation, he revived the long-forgotten Ascension Arcadia and transformed it into the premier enterprise for entertainment in Alexandria."
12,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_202","Alas, that revival came at a terrible price: psychonekrosis. The emergence of this terminal disease pained the president to no end, and in order to cure the fighters, he ultimately chose to make the greatest sacrifice."
13,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_203","With his love for theater, he had originally pursued a career as a stage actor. I daresay none was better suited to the part of the villainous president.  "
14,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_204","To perform the role of a lifetime on the grand stage that is the Arcadion may well have been a fulfillment of his heart's desire."
15,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_205","What's more, in no small part thanks to you, the Arcadion is no longer dependent on feral souls to deliver thrills. Wherever the president is now, I am sure he has no regrets."
16,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_300","It is both the namesake of Lindblum itself, and the great serpent the president had become. I will share with you what he confided to me..."
17,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_301","Lindwurms once thrived in the lands where the nation of Lindblum was founded. Awed by the creatures' great size and regenerative abilities, the first settlers chose to name their home after them, in hopes that it might bloom eternal and undying."
18,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_302","By the time of the Storm Surge, the Lindwurm had become little more than myth. But as the conflict raged on, a sole egg was discovered."
19,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_303","In those troubled times, many suffered from excessive exposure to lightning aether, and developed symptoms such as debilitating paralysis."
20,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_304","Seeking to deliver relief to the masses, scientists began conducting research on the Lindwurm egg, that they might develop a medicine that stimulates one's regeneration factor. Yet no matter what they tried, they could not hatch the egg."
21,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_305","It remained unhatched as the nation of Lindblum collapsed, and was entrusted into the care of the president's ancestor when he fled his homeland."
22,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_306","As the years went on, the egg was all but forgotten. But that would change when the first cases of psychonekrosis were diagnosed in Arcadion fighters."
23,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_307","Seeking a cure for the affliction, the president enlisted a scientist acquaintance at Origenics. It was then that he unearthed Lindblum's abandoned research into the regeneration factor."
24,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_308","The president would often say that he felt a sense of destiny in that moment, when he learned that he could put to use the egg he had inherited."
25,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_309","The rest, you know as well as me. Thanks to the advent of soul technology, he was able to extract the Lindwurm's soul from the unhatched egg. And he injected it into himself, in a bid to cure his fighters."
26,"TEXT_REGSAK6METEM_00972_METEM_000_310","Alas, he found that his regenerative powers could not be used on others, and he was left with but one option: to see the Lindwurm slain, that a stimulant might be created from its heart."
