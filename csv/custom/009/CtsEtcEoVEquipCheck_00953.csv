0,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_100_000","Hey! Didn't I see you in the Boyahda Tree? Get anything good from Aquarius?"
1,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_000","I'm something of a treasure hunter, and judging by your gear, I'd say you've claimed your fair share of spoils too."
2,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_001","Say, isn't that a fire staff? A fine choice. I've heard it's Shantotto's favorite, though knowing her, she probably wields a Vulcan's Staff."
3,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_003","Is that...koenig armor!? How in the world did you get the abjuration to purify it? I tried for weeks to hunt one, but someone always beat me to the punch."
4,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_004","Getting your hands on Ares' armor is no mean feat. I don't know what's worse, the Qiqirn treasure hunters constantly running away, or the chariots and their homing missiles."
5,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_005","Well I'll be damned... Kirin's Osode. My sympathies to the ninja that helped you get that."
6,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_006","It's always nice to see a fellow adventurer who appreciates the merits of a scorpion harness. If only Serket didn't always leave a mountain of bodies in its wake..."
7,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_007","That's a fine vermilion cloak you've got there. Were you one of the lucky ones who nabbed their cloth from Aquarius? I've heard rumors that the bastard doesn't drop it anymore."
8,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_008","I hope you had an easier time summoning Hakutaku than I did. I thought my heart stopped the first time I failed making an eye cluster..."
9,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_009","I like your hairpin. Brings back memories of my days hunting in Valkurm. The sounds of the beach were always so soothing."
10,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_010","Nothing like a pair of strider boots to help make a quick exit, eh? "
11,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_011","Is that a Cassie earring? It's beautiful to be sure, but I'm not sure it's worth dealing with such a nasty morbol. Just the thought of being drawn into its clutches makes my fur stand on end."
12,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_012","<gasp> A defending ring! B-But they're so rare! I'm sure white mages are constantly falling over themselves to join your parties."
13,"TEXT_CTSETCEOVEQUIPCHECK_00953_VANAADV05234B_000_013","Well, I must say I'm impressed. If you happen to find anything else of interest, I'd love to see it."
