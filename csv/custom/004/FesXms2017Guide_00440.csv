1,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_Q1_000_001","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_A1_000_001","What is the Starlight Celebration?"
3,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_A1_000_002","What's your task in all this?"
4,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_010","The Starlight Celebration can be traced back to ancient Ishgard. Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_011","Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_012","Owing to their generosity, the children survived the winter and lived to pay forward the kindness they had received. The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born."
8,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_013","Over the years, the celebration has undergone gradual changes. The snowy-bearded captain of the kind-hearted knights has become known as the “Saint of Nymeia,” and children believe that he delivers their hopes and prayers directly to the goddess Herself."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_014","Similarly, his red-jacketed knights have become the “saint's little helpers.” They are particularly beloved by the younglings, for it is their role to bring gifts to every child who sends a prayer to the Spinner."
10,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_020","My scarlet-clad colleagues and I have been charged by the Adventurers' Guild with running the Starlight Celebration. The festival spans the entire realm of Eorzea, and we have little helpers stationed in the cities of Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah."
11,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_021","This year, we plan to incorporate the Adventurers' Guild's trained bears into the proceedings. They've been taught a Starlight-themed trick sure to bring a smile to all─especially the younglings!"
12,"TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_022","We've had a few hiccups so far and might need adventurers such as yourself to assist in the smooth running of the festival. If all goes according to plan, I'm sure this year's festivities will be the best ever! "
