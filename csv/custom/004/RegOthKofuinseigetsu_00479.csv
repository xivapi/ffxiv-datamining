0,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_100_000","To think that this place shall be remembered by future scholars as the birthplace of the Namazu renaissance... Pardon me, I need a moment to collect my thoughts. A new era is upon us, and I must be at my most enlightened to greet it!"
1,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_000","I trust you are doing your utmost for the cultural enlightenment of my brethren? I personally occupy my days with myriad tasks relating to the festival, and spend my nights researching means to further civilize our activities. Sleep is for the primitive, my dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
2,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_001","A Hingan government scholar wrote to intellectuals in every locale with a series of questions, and used their answers in penning <Emphasis>The Chrysanthemum and the Dango</Emphasis>. It is a superlative source on regional culture and tradition! You really ought to read it, you know."
3,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_002","Though much work doubtless lies ahead of us, the aetheryte has already doubled─nay, tripled─the respectability of our festival. No one could possibly take us for uncultured with such an impressive symbol of civilization towering over the grounds!"
4,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_003","I trust you will retrieve any suitably intellectual publications you discover in Kugane for me? Assuming you have an eye for academic texts, of course."
5,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_004","Gyoshin's account of your journey to Kugane was troubling. Though I do not necessarily object to him being pummeled, we do require him at full capacity if our festival projects are to proceed apace. It will be necessary for you to accompany him on any further excursions."
6,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_005","As I continue my scholarly pursuits, I find myself becoming ever more enlightened. I fear that it will be increasingly difficult not to intimidate those of lesser intellect. Ah, how tragic it is to be cursed with such genius!"
7,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_006","The Xaela possess a deeply fascinating culture, though I must say they seem rather primitive from the perspective of a sophisticated man like myself."
8,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_007","Why did I not interview the Xaela myself? My dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, are you that unaware of how fortunate you are to be of a less appetizing race? Namazu cannot simply flit about, interviewing whomsoever we please! And I am much too vital to the Namazu's enlightenment to risk ending up in someone's buuz."
9,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_008","I am certain I encountered a volume containing the rules of Azim Bökh. Perhaps it was <Emphasis>Napping Tiger, Poorly Concealed Dragon</Emphasis>... Yes, that is the one. I must consult it posthaste."
10,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_009","Though your objective is to pierce the bull's-eye, I guarantee that no one will find fault were your arrow to stray."
11,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_010","I highly recommend <Emphasis>Narrow Road through the Deep Grass</Emphasis>─the fourth edition, of course. The earlier ones are riddled with errors. They are quite bulky, however, so I keep them close at fin for the times when Gyoshin is irritating me."
12,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_011","If the prospect did not involve sharing a sack with Gyoshin, I would travel to the Dravanian hinterlands myself. I should most like to visit the Great Gubal Library."
13,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_012","Remind me never to mention the bizarre again."
14,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_013","As soon as I got my fins on Master Matoya's manuscript, I read it from cover to cover. Not only are the rituals detailed therein fascinating, the writing is superlative. I find myself inspired!"
15,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_014","Allow me to guess─Gyoshin muddled the explanation of why festival participants traditionally present gifts to the hosts? It is to show gratitude for giving them the opportunity to escape the mundane, the routine, and forget their burdens─whether it be for a night or seven years."
16,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_015","<Emphasis>A Meditation on the Metaphysics of Merrymaking</Emphasis> is still in the draft stages, but rest assured that when it is published, you will be credited for your assistance. Please look forward to it!"
17,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_050","I am perfectly capable of overseeing the festivities alone, so you may devote all of your attention to the matter of Gyorei. I should like to believe that she will return here without incident, but as a scholar of history..."
18,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_051","Whatever is the matter, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Lost track of Gyoshin, have you? Pay no mind─it is an unfortunately frequent issue. He will doubtless find his way back in due time."
19,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_052","I assure you, all of my considerable intellect is focused on devising a means to liberate Gyorei. The stratagem I have in mind is certain to make an impact."
20,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_053","The maneuver was successful, then? Improving the mikoshi's flight capabilities required significant effort, but that's why we have Gyoshin, is it not?"
21,"TEXT_REGOTHKOFUINSEIGETSU_00479_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_054","You have my personal gratitude for returning Gyorei to us hale and whole. As I note in <Emphasis>A Meditation on the Metaphysics of Merrymaking</Emphasis>, her influence here is invaluable in ushering the masses toward the beacon of enlightenment."
