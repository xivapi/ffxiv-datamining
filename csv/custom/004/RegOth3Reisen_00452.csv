2,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_A1_000_001","What are auspices?"

7,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_A1_000_006","Nothing."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_003","Tell you what: I'll repeat the exact same thing I told you before when I first laid eyes on you and your bewildered friends. Ahem!"
9,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_004","""Don't know how it is in your homeland, but here, if an animal manages to survive a hundred years, it begins to get ideas. Delusions of grandeur. Some small power, sure, but nothing much to speak of.“"
10,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_005","""Survive ten times that and you become a full-fledged auspice, though. Speech! Magicks! It's quite the change, believe me, which is why we call it...<Emphasis>The Change</Emphasis>. What? I never said it was something clever.“"
11,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_006","""Anyway! Point is, don't let our appearances fool you. I could kill you five times before you hit the ground. But I won't, on account of me being civil. For now.“Not bad, eh? My mother always told me I was talented."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_007","Hm? The temple? Now I know someone had to have told you about that before. Forgetful bugger, aren't you?"
13,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_008","A long, long time ago, an auspice named Koryu succumbed to the aramitama and went mad with rage. You know, kill everyone, destroy everything. Anyway, Tenzen and the Four Lords put a stop to his murderous rampage and sealed him here."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_009","Afterwards, in order to strengthen the wards binding Koryu, the Four Lords used their powers to build a magnificent temple! And that temple is...this one, of course! You don't see any other temples around here, do you?"
15,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_010","Now this really ought to go without saying, but don't go messing about the inner sanctum touching the sacred crystal or breaking the sacred wards! Not unless you want to free Koryu and turn the Ruby Sea into the Ruby Sea of Fire or summat."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_011","Of course, since the world is filled with treasure hunters and cavalier idiots, the Four Lords hid the temple and recruited fellow auspices like yours truly to stand guard. So while it was never intended to be a home for us, it more or less became one."
17,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_012","Ah, Tenzen. Never knew him personally, but a decent bloke by all accounts."
18,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_013","He was a samurai and traveling companion of the Four Lords. Apparently he had the ability to converse with all sorts of living creatures. Some even said he could converse with this star itself, silly as it sounds."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_014","Anyway, Tenzen made no effort to hide his conversational talents, which invariably led to people calling him a demon or a witch. But despite that, he still liked to lend a helping hand where he could. Can't say I'd've done the same, but it seems to have paid off in the end."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_015","At some point during his travels with the Four Lords, people start calling Tenzen a hero, and tales of his derring-do reach the ears of this king who decides to summon Tenzen and ask him to give Koryu what for. Sure enough, Tenzen says yes."
21,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_016","Now, Tenzen's strong─stronger than the Four Lords at this point, even─and we've already established his altruistic streak. So off he goes, Phoenix Blade in hand, confronts Koryu, and sacrifices himself to seal the mad auspice away. Should've seen that one coming, am I right?"
22,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_017","The Ruby Sea and everyone in it are saved. People tell their children and their children's children of Tenzen's deeds, changing the details bit by bit. And that's how we end up with a ridiculous story about him and the Four Lords driving a host of oni into the sea."
23,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_018","Genbu? Hasn't he been talking your ear off this whole time? Thought you'd know by now who he is. I mean, I'll indulge you, if that's really what you want..."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_019","He's old and he's wise and he's got bad eyes─Genbuuu!♪Ahem. But seriously, he's one of the Four Lords. The most powerful, or at least he was at one time. He'd be the first to tell you he's not as spry as he used to be."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_020","But I suppose that's to be expected given that he's been using his strength to sustain Koryu's wards for, oh, several millennia, give or take? That's sure to wear anyone down."
26,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_021","Err...you're asking about our Byakko? Great big white tiger? The one you and your fellow warriors fought in a pitched battle to save his soul? Not some other Byakko, to be clear?"
27,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_022","Like Genbu, he's one of the Four Lords. From Yanxia, originally, though that was long before my time."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_023","Apparently his fellow tigers didn't much care for his snow white coat and cast him out. Personally, I'm rather envious of it. Can you imagine me with those stripes? No? Never mind..."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_024","Where was I? Ah, right. So one day Tenzen chances to meet Byakko, who does his usual “Go away or I'll eat your face!” bit. But Tenzen's having none of it, and somehow manages to convince Byakko to stop sulking and instead join him on an adventure or two."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_025","And wouldn't you know it, the ol' curmudgeon takes to life on the road like a fish to water! The two become inseparable, and together they manage to save Yanxia from a half-dozen calamities. Just goes to show you never know until you try, eh?"
31,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_500","It's been more than a few centuries since I last saw Byakko. He looks good!"
32,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_501","Looks like we owe you one, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I'd certainly have balked at facing Byakko in battle, what with those fangs and claws..."
