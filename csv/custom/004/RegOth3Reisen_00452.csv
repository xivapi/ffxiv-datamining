10,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_003","Tell you what: I'll repeat the exact same thing I told you before when I first laid eyes on you and your bewildered friends. Ahem!"
11,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_004","""Don't know how it is in your homeland, but here, if an animal manages to survive a hundred years, it begins to get ideas. Delusions of grandeur. Some small power, sure, but nothing much to speak of.“"
12,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_005","""Survive ten times that and you become a full-fledged auspice, though. Speech! Magicks! It's quite the change, believe me, which is why we call it...<Emphasis>the change</Emphasis>. What? I never said it was something clever.“"
13,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_006","""Anyway! Point is, don't let our appearances fool you. I could kill you five times before you hit the ground. But I won't, on account of me being civil. For now.“
Not bad, eh? My mother always told me I was talented."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_007","Hm? The temple? Now I know someone had to have told you about that before. Forgetful bugger, aren't you?"
15,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_008","A long, long time ago, an auspice named Koryu succumbed to the aramitama and went mad with rage. You know, kill everyone, destroy everything. Anyway, Tenzen and the Four Lords put a stop to his murderous rampage and sealed him here."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_009","Afterwards, in order to strengthen the wards binding Koryu, the Four Lords used their powers to build a magnificent temple! And that temple is...this one, of course! You don't see any other temples around here, do you?"
17,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_010","Now this really ought to go without saying, but don't go messing about the inner sanctum touching the sacred crystal or breaking the sacred wards! Not unless you want to free Koryu and turn the Ruby Sea into the Ruby Sea of Fire or summat."
18,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_011","Of course, since the world is filled with treasure hunters and cavalier idiots, the Four Lords hid the temple and recruited fellow auspices like yours truly to stand guard. So while it was never intended to be a home for us, it more or less became one."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_012","Ah, Tenzen. Never knew him personally, but a decent bloke by all accounts."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_013","He was a samurai and traveling companion of the Four Lords. Apparently he had the ability to converse with all sorts of living creatures. Some even said he could converse with this star itself, silly as it sounds."
21,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_014","Anyway, Tenzen made no effort to hide his conversational talents, which invariably led to people calling him a demon or a witch. But despite that, he still liked to lend a helping hand where he could. Can't say I'd've done the same, but it seems to have paid off in the end."
22,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_015","At some point during his travels with the Four Lords, people start calling Tenzen a hero, and tales of his derring-do reach the ears of this king who decides to summon Tenzen and ask him to give Koryu what for. Sure enough, Tenzen says yes."
23,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_016","Now, Tenzen's strong─stronger than the Four Lords at this point, even─and we've already established his altruistic streak. So off he goes, Phoenix Blade in hand, confronts Koryu, and sacrifices himself to seal the mad auspice away. Should've seen that one coming, am I right?"
24,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_017","The Ruby Sea and everyone in it are saved. People tell their children and their children's children of Tenzen's deeds, changing the details bit by bit. And that's how we end up with a ridiculous story about him and the Four Lords driving a host of oni into the sea."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_018","Genbu? Hasn't he been talking your ear off this whole time? Thought you'd know by now who he is. I mean, I'll indulge you, if that's really what you want..."
26,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_019","He's old and he's wise and he's got bad eyes─Genbuuu!♪
Ahem. But seriously, he's one of the Four Lords. The most powerful, or at least he was at one time. He'd be the first to tell you he's not as spry as he used to be."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_020","But I suppose that's to be expected given that he's been using his strength to sustain Koryu's wards for, oh, several millennia, give or take? That's sure to wear anyone down."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_100_020","Shame how he went out. That Koryu's not one to be trifled with, no sir. But hey, at least Soroban was ready and willing to fill his boots. Or is it shell? Anyway, you know what I mean."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_200_020","Gonna be strange having the both of them in one body for the next few centuries. It's for the best, what with Soroban needing a lot more training, but I don't know if I'll ever get used to the sight of him arguing with himself."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_021","Err...you're asking about our Byakko? Great big white tiger? The one you and your fellow warriors fought in a pitched battle to save his soul? Not some other Byakko, to be clear?"
31,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_022","Like Genbu, he's one of the Four Lords. From Yanxia, originally, though that was long before my time."
32,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_023","Apparently his fellow tigers didn't much care for his snow white coat and cast him out. Personally, I'm rather envious of it. Can you imagine me with those stripes? No? Never mind..."
33,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_024","Where was I? Ah, right. So one day Tenzen chances to meet Byakko, who does his usual “Go away or I'll eat your face!” bit. But Tenzen's having none of it, and somehow manages to convince Byakko to stop sulking and instead join him on an adventure or two."
34,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_025","And wouldn't you know it, the ol' curmudgeon takes to life on the road like a fish to water! The two become inseparable, and together they manage to save Yanxia from a half-dozen calamities. Just goes to show you never know until you try, eh?"
35,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_030","I'm starting to wonder if you've got some sort of difficulty remembering things. Maybe too many whacks to the noggin over the years?"
36,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_031","Anyway, as I'm fairly certain she already told you, Suzaku was born with fiery red plumage that caught the eye of one and all."
37,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_032","Unfortunately, this meant that an awful lot of idiots mistook her for the Firebird, a legendary being that could confer immortality upon those it deemed worthy or some such rubbish. Needless to say, they chased her all over!"
38,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_033","Tenzen, however, was different. He was the first man she ever met who appreciated her for who she was."
39,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_034","Bam! Just like that, she fell head over heels for the samurai. Not that I blame her. Everyone wants to be loved─even peerless warriors like you and me."
40,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_035","No one knows for sure, but Suzaku thinks that it was the unbearable pain she carried with her in the years following Tenzen's death that drove her to manifest powers reminiscent of the Firebird. So that others wouldn't have to suffer like she had..."
41,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_100_040","...Really? Seiryu? Big ol' snake-dragon-dragon-snake auspice?"
42,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_040","I guess it's to be expected that a hero's memory would be shot full of holes due to all that head trauma. Can't be helped, as the Hingans are wont to say."
43,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_041","Seiryu had the good fortune to be born on an island where they were pretty fond of snakes, so when he got older and started to attain a measure of divinity, the people there began to worship him. 'Course, being so young, he couldn't do a damn thing to help them when life took a turn for the worse."
44,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_042","So they give child sacrifice a try, and wouldn't you know it? Their fortunes improve. Pure coincidence─especially since Seiryu set them free in secret, but after that the people started thinking their patron snake was more of a demon than a guardian. Hired hunters and the like to kill him. Bloody fools."
45,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_043","Tenzen comes along, doles out a beating, and takes pity on the snake, who joins the gang. Seiryu's fairly fond of our samurai─though he vows to grow stronger and more dragon-like that he might one day beat him in a rematch. Unfortunately, he never gets the chance. And so it goes..."
46,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_100_500","Remember: don't let our appearances fool you. I could kill you five times before you hit the ground. But I won't, on account of me being civil. For now."
47,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_500","It's been more than a few centuries since I last saw Byakko. He looks good!"
48,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_501","Looks like we owe you one, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I'd certainly have balked at facing Byakko in battle, what with those fangs and claws..."
49,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_510","If anyone can make Suzaku see reason, it's you. Good luck!"
50,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_511","Brought Suzaku back to her senses, did you? Hah, as if there was ever any doubt! Easy money, I told Kamaitachi, but the greedy bugger couldn't help but take the long odds."
51,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_520","You'll be putting a stop to this Koryu business, aye? You damn well better. If he breaks free, it's not just the temple that's done for, but the Ruby Sea and everyone in it..."
52,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_525","Glad all that's over with─for now. The collective'll be staying here for the foreseeable future, in case you were wondering. Someone's gotta keep an eye on things for the next couple of thousand years, after all."
53,"TEXT_REGOTH3REISEN_00452_SENRI_000_530","You're all right, friend. I'll be sure to say as much to the next hero what comes knocking a few millennia from now when we need to do this whole song and dance all over again."
