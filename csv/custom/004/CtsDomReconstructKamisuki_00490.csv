15,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTKAMISUKI_00490_ARARAGI_000_032","Each sheet is produced one at a time with a technique unchanged since antiquity. Though relatively quick, the process takes years to master. Yet the effort is well worth it."
16,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTKAMISUKI_00490_ARARAGI_000_033","Doman paper was prized for both its durability and its beauty, so much so that merchants would bicker and squabble and strive to outbid one another, so certain they were that they could still turn a profit. Indeed, it was arguably our most successful export."

30,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTKAMISUKI_00490_ARARAGI_000_073","Of late the enclave has seen increased traffic─visitors from near and far. We cannot afford to give them anything less than the best impression, and so I thought to sell decorations and other colorful papercraft."
31,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTKAMISUKI_00490_ARARAGI_000_074","Perchance you are familiar with kazagu─ Ah, yes, there is a word you know for this. Pinwheels. Miniature windmills made of paper, yes?"
32,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTKAMISUKI_00490_ARARAGI_000_075","As the wind blows, the little wheels spin. A simple child's pleasure, to look on one held in the hand, perhaps, but the sight of many arranged is a rather more grand spectacle."
33,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTKAMISUKI_00490_ARARAGI_000_076","Still, I expect little profit will come from sales to what few customers we receive here. Wholesale traders remain the key to our success."
