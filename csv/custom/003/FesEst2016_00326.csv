6,"TEXT_FESEST2016_00326_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_010","Miss Jihli Aliapoh is the founder of our festival and the chosen herald of the Twelve Archons, legendary saviors from the time of the Sixth Umbral Calamity. She has great cause to believe that the Archons desire to walk amongst us once more, for they appeared to her in a grand vision a number of years ago."
7,"TEXT_FESEST2016_00326_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_011","She described the heroes of yore as triumphantly parting the clouds, riding atop beautifully decorated eggs and delivering a message: “Arise, young Dreamer, and make ready the vessels for our return!” In hearing their words, Miss Aliapoh has gathered others to her cause, known as the Dreamers, and together we aspire to bring about the Archons' divine descent, one decorated egg at a time."
8,"TEXT_FESEST2016_00326_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_012","While our festivities have attracted townsfolk and adventurers alike, mostly for the famous egg hunts and prizes, we remind all that the reason we continue to live to this day is in part due to our twelve saviors' selfless actions during the Calamity. You could say Hatching–tide is our way of paying respect to those heroes of ages past, and preparing for their return in the future."

10,"TEXT_FESEST2016_00326_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_020","Egg hunts are a tried and true Hatching–tide tradition. Our founder has had multiple visions of adventurers bustling to find brilliant colored eggs. However, as is the case with dreams, no two hunts are quite alike."
11,"TEXT_FESEST2016_00326_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_021","Miss Aliapoh described the hunt in her most recent vision as “abrupt,” and sometimes “frantic,” ending no sooner than it appeared before blending into her next lucid vision. To recreate that feeling, our founder has hidden white Archon eggs amongst the vibrantly colored decorations you see around Old Gridania, and employed her most fidgety spriggan to oversee the frivolities for as long as it can stand still. Should you spot this spriggan sauntering about, follow him, and the hunt will soon begin."
12,"TEXT_FESEST2016_00326_SYSTEM_000_022","During this event, the FATE “Eggstract and Eggspedite” will appear throughout Old Gridania. The fortune eggs received as rewards for participating in these FATEs can be exchanged for seasonal goods."
13,"TEXT_FESEST2016_00326_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_030","Every year, we Dreamers prepare a multitude of prizes for all who join in the celebration of Hatching–tide. How do you obtain these prizes, you ask? Why, gathering fortune eggs, of course! This year, we have an array of games for you to play and upon completion, each which will reward you with an egg."
