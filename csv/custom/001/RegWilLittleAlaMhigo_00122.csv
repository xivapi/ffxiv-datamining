2,"TEXT_REGWILLITTLEALAMHIGO_00122_GISILBEHRT_000_002","Ho, this is a pleasant surprise. Come to look in on the refugees now that they are free to return to Ala Mhigo?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILLITTLEALAMHIGO_00122_GISILBEHRT_000_010","I have charge of security here at Little Ala Mhigo, though that's just half of my duties. The other half is maintaining surveillance over the Amalj'aa encampment to the south."

13,"TEXT_REGWILLITTLEALAMHIGO_00122_GISILBEHRT_000_041","But thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Alliance and the Resistance─and you and yours, of course─the imperial forces have been driven from Gyr Abania, and these good men and women are free to return home, if they so desire."
14,"TEXT_REGWILLITTLEALAMHIGO_00122_GISILBEHRT_000_042","That said, many of them have built new lives for themselves here, and I suspect some are hesitant to pack it all up and move back to a place they left decades ago...or never knew at all. But I'm just a man of Thanalan, so what do I know."
