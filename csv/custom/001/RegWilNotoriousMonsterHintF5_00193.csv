12,"TEXT_REGWILNOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF5_00193_MOBHUNTERW1F5_000_21","“Many fell, and suffered much in the falling. Multiple witnesses attest that Dalvag was the last of the company and fought as a man possessed till the end, the names of the dead tumbling in hoarse barks through cracked lips. Scholars theorize that his mortal remains are animated by a thirst for vengeance alone.”"
