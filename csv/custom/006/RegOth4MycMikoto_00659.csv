1,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_000_001","It will take time, but I am confident its reserves of energy can be replenished."
2,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_000_002","You will be the first to know when the crystal focus is ready."
3,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_000_003","If there is nothing else, I will leave you to your duties."
4,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_Q30_000_000","What will you say?"
5,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_A30_000_000","Tell me about the seers."
6,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_A30_000_001","Tell me about the crystal focus."
7,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_A30_000_002","Tell me about memory exploration."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_A30_000_003","Tell me about your gift."
9,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_A30_000_004","Tell me about yourself."
10,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_A30_000_0010","Nothing."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_200","Scant though they are, the records we have uncovered thus far suggest the practices of seers date back as far as the Fourth Astral Era."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_201","The region was plagued with all manner of natural disasters in those days, inciting great unrest not only amongst the Bozjans, but neighboring nations as well."
13,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_202","It was during these tumultuous times seers first appeared. In fact, I have reason to believe they possessed the Echo."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_203","Using a crystal focus, they were able to delve into the minds of the downcast and the heartsick, seeking out their darkest memories and altering them to ease the peoples' burdens."
15,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_204","Perhaps they saw the altering of minds as a necessity for their survival, but we must consider the ethical implications of such methods in this day and age. I have no doubt my betters in Sharlayan would consider it to be reprehensible."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_300","My initial analysis of the crystals suggest they are man-made. Nothing in my data can prove the materials are unique to this region, which leads me to believe the Bozjans─or rather, the seers─created them."
17,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_301","However, given the intricate lattices found in these crystals, it seems highly improbable that the Bozjans could have produced them, considering the methods available to them in the Fourth Astral Era."
18,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_302","In fact, on closer inspection, it became clear that its structure is quite similar to that found in Allagan constructs."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_303","Which then begs the question: who were the seers, and whence did they come? This is but a working theory, but I suspect their roots can be traced back to the Allagans themselves─perhaps survivors of the Fourth Umbral Calamity who wished to atone for the sins of their forebears."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_304","They came to these lands seeking a means to help the Bozjans, and in doing so created these crystal foci."
21,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_305","...Ahem. As I said, 'tis but a working theory. Though I understand if it sounds more like a flight of fancy."
22,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_400","Perhaps I should start with a simple explanation, as I did before. Let us consider the composition of a person's aether, shall we? There is corporeal aether of the flesh, incorporeal aether of the soul, and the aetherial residue of an individual's memories."
23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_401","Were one to be possessed of only corporeal aether, they would be but a walking corpse. Conversely, entities comprised of only incorporeal aether are referred to in layman's terms as ghosts. Of course, a ghost that possesses residual memories could likely recall its past and retain self-awareness."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_402","Using a crystal focus, we can isolate the aetherial signature of memories, much in the same way the seers did. We can then delve into and explore specific memories conjured by the subject."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_403","We must be careful of what we observe, however, for while the information stored in a person's memories can be quite comprehensive, it is not always true to fact. They can be distorted due to the passage of time, or even when first committed to the mind as a result of personal bias."
26,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_404","That is why it is important to mark the distinction between explicit and implicit memories."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_405","Explicit memories are those consciously stored and recalled, while implicit memories are more passively accumulated by our subconscious."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_406","When meeting someone for the first time, their appearance will be kept as part of our explicit memory, though this may fade with the passing of time. Should a great deal of time pass without meeting, however, such recollection can prove difficult."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_407","Yet in that moment, your mind also takes record of everything experienced by your sensory nervous system."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_408","Unfortunately, information called from explicit memory is quite sensitive to misrepresentations of events. After all, if an individual is actively choosing to recall an event, who is to say they will not make alterations to better suit their liking?"
31,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_409","That is why we seek information from implicit memory, which is more likely to be preserved free of the bias of an individual's worldview."
32,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_500","The Echo can manifest itself in myriad ways dependent on the individual. I was gifted with the ability to peer into the future."
33,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_501","It is a power much like prophetic dreams and divinations, and yet quite different, for such visions only tell of the future's potential."
34,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_502","The Echo does not show me what may happen, but what <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> happen."
35,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_503","Scholars speculate Mezaya Thousand Eyes too shared this gift, hence the alarming accuracy of the passages writ in her <Emphasis>Divine Chronicles</Emphasis>."
36,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_504","These visions are a decidedly rare occurrence, usually containing some crucial insight into matters presently unfolding before me. For better or worse, I have never had visions of an impending threat on my life or those around me."
37,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_505","Not that I would want to see such things, of course. Could you imagine, knowing of certain doom that cannot be avoided?"
38,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_506","I once spoke of my visions to an acquaintance─a relatively harmless glimpse of the future─and it resulted in a terrible argument. I fear I could not bear the weight of grimmer tidings..."
39,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_507","But that is neither here nor there. My gift is but a trivial thing. Nothing you should think to rely upon."
40,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_600","About me!? Oh, there really isn't much to tell, I assure you!"
41,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_601","Well, if you must know... Due to advanced placement I found myself attending the Studium much earlier than most. My research in the field of aetherology would eventually earn me the title of Archon. When I am not conducting research in the field, I conduct lectures at the Studium."
42,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_602","Moenbryda is, er...was...my mentor. I would not be the scholar I am today if not for her. I have fond memories of the many nights we toiled together working on her original plans for the aetheric siphon. She was like a sister to me."
43,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_603","Speaking of which, I do have a sister, actually. An identical twin, in fact. Though we have not spoken since she too was named an Archon."
44,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_604","She was my better in all aspects of academia, but she often disagreed with the views of the Forum. I can but assume that is why she took her leave of the Studium."
45,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_605","She was always so strong-willed and quite critical of those around her. Sadly, we never got along very well growing up. I often wonder if that is why Moenbryda was so quick to take me under her wing."
46,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_606","I still see her, in my dreams. Always offering a warm smile and words of encouragement."
47,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_607","If we were to use the crystal focus, perhaps there would be a way to speak with her again. A tempting prospect, but in the end, I know it would not truly be her..."
