1,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_001","Well, I don't understand what's going on here, but I don't intend on staying long enough after my work is through."
2,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_002","Though I suppose I can take a moment to talk, if there's something you need to know."
3,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_005","There is still much I do not understand of this apparition that attacked you at the castrum. What I <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> understand, however, is there is likely only one among us capable of standing against it."
4,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_006","Is there something you need? If not, I will leave you to your business."
5,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_010","What on earth has gotten into Mikoto? I thought she had better sense than to run headlong into danger."
6,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_015","I see you and Mikoto have returned in one piece. Good."
7,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_016","Care to share what you found out there? Or is there something else you wish to talk about?"
8,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_020","The more we learn of this Save the Queen, the slimmer our chances of success seem to become. Not that slim odds ever deter you from a challenge, eh?"
9,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_025","I may no longer be of the Dalmascan Royal Fusiliers, but my aim is no less sharp, I assure you. Let us put an end to the imperials' schemes, yes?"
10,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_030","And here I thought our work might finally be finished. I've seen warships like that before in Dalmasca. This does not bode well for the Resistance..."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_031","I'm sorry. Was there something you wished to talk about?"
12,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_Q30_000_000","What will you say?"
13,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_A30_000_000","Tell me about the situation in Dalmasca."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_A30_000_001","Tell me about yourself."
15,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_A30_000_002","Tell me about the Bangaa."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_A30_000_0010","Nothing."
17,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_000","Dalmasca? That's precisely why I'm here. Lady Fran asked that I relay the news to Bajsaljen. What I have to say is meant only for his ears, but I suppose she wouldn't be cross if you were to hear as well. "
18,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_001","The resistance forces in Dalmasca and Nagxia have been planning assaults of their own to coincide with the Bozjan's strike on the castrum here."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_002","In Dalmasca their target was Castrum Amicitia, known to most as the nigh-impenetrable Nalbina fortress. Their losses were great, but in the end their efforts were rewarded with victory."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_003","In Nagxia they succeeded in taking a port to cut off their supply chain. The IVth Legion was surprisingly quick to turn tail from what I've been told."
21,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_004","The forces in both Dalmasca and Nagxia are overjoyed by their success, but Lady Fran suspects something is amiss. She believes victory should not have been so easily won against the IVth Legion."
22,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_005","To that end, we have begun tracking their activity more closely. And considering the state of affairs in the Empire, we found it curious there has been little to or from their base of operations in Valnain."
23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_006","After the death of Lord Varis, it would be an understatement to say the Empire fell into disarray. It's a war of factions in the truest sense of the word."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_007","According to our intelligence, the IVth Legion has been ordered to return to the imperial capital, but Gabranth has refused. He's since proclaimed that Dalmasca will be the site of a new nation he intends to build."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_008","Sounds to me like if he means to continue his fight for Bozja, the IVth Legion will be doing it alone."
26,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_009","There may never be a more prime opportunity than now to defeat them. There's a growing call to strike, and I'm inclined to agree that we should. But Lady Fran insisted we wait until we better understood the IVth Legion's goal."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_010","She had hoped the Bozjan's conflict with Gabranth's forces might shed some light on their motives, and it seems her suspicions were well founded."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_011","Even so, that apparition, whatever it was, is certainly more than we were expecting. I hate to think what else he might have planned."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_015","Our allies in Dalmasca and Nagxia will be pleased to hear of your victories over the imperials thus far. It would not surprise me if the news did not embolden them to hasten their plans to take the offensive."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_016","Would that we could discern what Gabranth is after here, though. Lady Fran was convinced they would retreat from Bozja, and the loss of Save the Queen only gives them greater cause to fall back."
31,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_017","Instead they bring an imperial warship. But why? What could they possibly hope to gain by remaining here?"
32,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_100","Me? What's there to tell? A former fusilier to the royal family working with the Resistance against our common enemy─the IVth Legion."
33,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_101","For now, I serve as liaison for Lady Fran. I can already tell there will be much to speak of when I return to Dalmasca."
34,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_000","About the Bangaa? I would have thought you had more pressing matters to attend to. Though I suppose my people are an unfamiliar sight to you Eorzeans. Very well..."
35,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_001","To start, it should be noted that we Bangaa are mammals, not reptiles. A common misconception due to our scaly appearance."
36,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_002","I say “scaly,” but these are not, in fact, scales you see on our skin. When our fur sheds, scant though it may be, patches of it do not grow back. Instead, the skin grows callous and hardens into scalelike patterns."
37,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_003","...What? Is what I'm saying truly so surprising? I suppose you also thought we were born from eggs as well. I will forgive you for your ignorance, if only this once. My brethren would certainly have more than a few choice words to share."
38,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_004","Ahem, now where was I? Ah, yes. We Bangaa are also quite long-lived. On average, I would say we live twice as long as the average Hyur."
39,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_005","We mature by the age of fifteen, shedding our skin once a year. Shedding becomes less frequent after that, occurring once every four to─
...There's that look again. I know what you're thinking, and I swear to the Twelve if the word “lizard” escapes your lips I will not think twice about cutting them off."
40,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_006","As I was saying, we Bangaa are perhaps known best for our superior sense of smell and hearing, as well as our physical prowess. Our greatest weakness, I am embarrassed to say, lies with our voices."
41,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_007","To be more precise, it is the unique structure of our vocal cords. It makes the incantation of spells rather difficult for us, which is why Bangaa practitioners of magic are exceedingly rare."
42,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_008","Hmmm... What else? There was once a time you could distinguish between clansmen by the color of their skin, but after many years of intermingling such distinctions have become meaningless. Nevertheless, one can never be too mindful."
43,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_009","The Ruga are known to have yellow-brown skin, the Faas have bronze skin, the Bista have red-brown skin, and the Sanga have ash grey skin."
44,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_200_010","That should suffice, I think. Consider yourself duly educated on the Bangaa. If you should remember anything, I pray it is what <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to call us."
