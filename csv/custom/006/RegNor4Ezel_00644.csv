1,"TEXT_REGNOR4EZEL_00644_EZELII_000_010","Lest you wonder, my creator named me for their esteemed teacher, who was said to be a hermetic of unrivaled skill. I should like to meet them, but apparently they are no longer in Il Mheg."

5,"TEXT_REGNOR4EZEL_00644_EZELII_000_050","To not only lose a dear friend, but to know that perhaps their aether is responsible for all this... It must be very difficult for Tyr Beq."
6,"TEXT_REGNOR4EZEL_00644_EZELII_000_060","An Lad becomes ever more unstable, and little wonder. The aether that forms them is too potent for a newborn pixie to bear."

8,"TEXT_REGNOR4EZEL_00644_EZELII_000_080","Pixies are simple beings. When faced with hardship, rather than fight it, it is said that they will simply abandon living altogether. I gravely fear that An Lad is on that course."

11,"TEXT_REGNOR4EZEL_00644_EZELII_000_102","Not so certain, however, is whether this union between aether and soul happened by chance or by design. The academic in me can't help but wonder, but I doubt that question shall ever be answered."
