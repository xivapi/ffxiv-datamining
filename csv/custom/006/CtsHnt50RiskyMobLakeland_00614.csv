Maybe you should consider becoming a member. If you're the sort that enjoys the singular thrill that comes from dancing with death, heh heh..."

That it was people spying upon a tribe of cannibals in the middle of their dinner who convinced themselves they couldn't possibly be seeing what they saw.
