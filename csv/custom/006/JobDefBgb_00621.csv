2,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_001_000","So, you've been dabbling in other disciplines, have you? It's always good to have more than one trick up your sleeve. That's something I've come to understand from seeing the adventurers passing through here."
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_002_000","So, you've been dabbling in other disciplines, have you? It's always good to have more than one trick up your sleeve. But for people like Rostik and myself, we prefer to stick to what we know."

11,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_000_013","To tell the truth, this is the first time since fleeing the Empire that we've found any semblance of peace. We both learned a lot from traveling around Eorzea, but this is the only place we've really felt at home."

13,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_000_111","I must admit that it was a great relief to discover that I was not the last of my kind, nor the last Bozjan gunbreaker. It also means that I need not be in such a hurry to find successors to inherit our techniques."
