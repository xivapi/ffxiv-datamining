1,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_Q1_000_000","What will you ask about?"

6,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_A1_000_004","Nothing."
7,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_003","Brother? Oh, he's practically my right hand─if one with a mind of its own. He can be infuriatingly cautious, though. “That's quite enough gunpowder, Anogg,” and the like. Hmph. Really tangles my beard, sometimes."
8,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_004","Can't say I know more than you do. We've seen that these “machine lifeforms” are highly advanced, and highly violent... If 2P is to be believed, they're capable of some degree of independent thought, as well. The rest is a mystery! Wouldn't be much fun otherwise, would it?"
9,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_005","Don't you worry─I'll figure out what makes them tick eventually. I always do!"
10,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_006","Hmm... Yes, I've been contemplating them too. Just imagine! With that kind of technology, that kind of <Emphasis>power</Emphasis>...<cough> Well, we don't want it falling into the wrong hands, that's for certain!"
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_007","I know you're impatient to see results. I am too, believe me."
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_008","And I know there's a way to revive the blasted thing with the knocker crystal you brought us...we just haven't found it yet."
13,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_009","I've tried wiring, and whacking, and just sort of...nudging the two at each other to see how they react. Nothing!"
14,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_ANOGG_000_010","But we'll get there, trust me! There's nothing Konogg and I can't do, and when we get our hands on that weaponry, you'll be glad you got on our good sides early. Mwahahaha!"
15,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_050","No, thank you, I don't need anything murdered at the moment. Or...did you want something?"
16,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_Q2_000_000","What will you ask about?"
17,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_A2_000_001","Anogg."

22,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_052","I love my sister, of course. Even if she <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> quick to rush into danger, and quicker to open her mouth. If only she would actually listen to me..."
23,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_053","Curious, aren't they? And certainly complex. I made note of a plethora of different parts belonging to the machine lifeforms you destroyed in the ruins."
24,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_054","Of course, the amount of parts involved makes it possible for them to be assembled into myriad configurations─as you doubtless noticed. I'm working on categorizing them now."
25,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_055","I'd like to know about them myself. All we have to go on is what 2P said─and that muddied the issue, if anything. What is this faction that apparently threatens us, and why is 2P working against them? We desperately need to learn more."
26,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_056","Have I been continuing my research into the ruins, you ask? Quite frankly, I'm surprised you remembered."
27,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_057","I am though, yes. There are simply too many variables at present. Every scrap of information is a small reduction in our chances of being horribly murdered by mechanical monstrosities."
28,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_058","There are worse ways to go, mind. And I'll admit that a lot of my desire to keep digging around down there is due to good old-fashioned curiosity."
29,"TEXT_REGNOR4YTCTWINS1_00643_KONOGG_000_059","In any case, I have no plans to stop─and that goes triple for Anogg, as I'm sure you've noticed."
