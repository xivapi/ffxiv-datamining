1,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_001","Someone had to go and open a path to the Tempest's floor, huh? Which means those marks we thought we'd never have to deal with could well waltz up to our front door. Good thing you Nutters are around to deal with them. What are you on the hunt for?"
2,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
3,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_A1_000_001","Tell me about the rank B elite mark. (Deacon)"
4,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_A1_000_002","Tell me about the rank B elite mark. (Gilshs Aath Swiftclaw)"
5,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_A1_000_003","Tell me about the rank A elite mark. (Baal)"
6,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_A1_000_004","Tell me about the rank A elite mark. (Rusalka)"
7,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_A1_000_005","Tell me about the rank S elite mark. (Gunitt)"
8,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_A1_000_006","Nothing."
9,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_010","Before the Flood, the Ondo had turned up all kinds of ruins deep in the ocean. Some of them saw deeper meaning in it─religious meaning. But like the Church of the First Light and many other traditions, much of that was lost with the coming of the Flood."
10,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_011","Apparently one of those defunct traditions worshipped a great crab, Deacon. Perfection incarnate that surpassed man and Ondo alike, a venerated being that would guide the faithful unto glory everlasting."
11,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_012","For a holy symbol he was awfully clever, too. Would stumble about like a drunken sailor and lure would-be predators to come close enough for him to reach out and crush 'em with his mighty claws. Aye, he's definitely smarter than the average crab."
12,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_020","Gilshs Aath Swiftclaw is one of those benthos bastards. A master fisherman who works both the shallows and the depths, bringing in his catch with his bare hands."
13,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_021","You're probably wondering why someone saw fit to put a bounty on a fisherman, eh? Well, that'd be because this one uses other fishermen as bait. Other Ondo and poor fools he's dragged from Eulmoran boats, all in service to some long-forgotten god."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_022","It's gotten so bad that some folks are too afraid to take to the water, so the authorities would have us put a stop to him before any more sacrifices are made."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_030","If you've been down to the ocean floor, you might've seen the dagons wandering about. They're a nuisance to be sure, and not at all a pleasure to look upon."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_031","Well, there's this Ondo legend about something even worse born of a dagon, a temperamental fiend that sows chaos if angered, but invites calm if appeased. Baal, they call him, and under normal circumstances they might simply try to keep a wide berth..."
17,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_032","Unfortunately, it seems it's a little too late for that. And now the fabled cleansing hour is at hand, when all creatures of the sea must bow to Baal or be destroyed. Neither option is ideal, so we'd all very much appreciate it if you could go and kill the damned thing."
18,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_040","Doubtless you've noticed the wrecks on the shore and at the bottom of the Tempest. Eulmore's a city on the sea, and like most such cities it's seen countless ships come and go over the years and decades. Accidents happen."
19,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_041","A few merchant vessels sink, and it's a small tragedy, aye. But a royal flagship carrying a foreign queen? That's another story. This one had no shortage of unfinished business, which is probably why her soul lingered where she died, her regret festering and twisting her goodly nature..."
20,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_042","They say Rusalka's bewitching beauty and hypnotic voice guided a hundred ships to their watery graves. She's got far fewer to prey on now, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if she sets her sights on anyone and everyone wandering the Tempest floor..."
21,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_050","Gunitt was like most other dwarves of Kholusia─tough, hardworking, tiny. By all accounts he was content with his lot, until one day he spied a Galdjent three times his size strolling through the market, and decided he'd make himself tall or die trying."
22,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_051","So he travels the world, amasses all kinds of treasure, then pays a visit to a Nu Mou hermit who claims they can make his dreams come true, and would you believe it? Gunitt gets his wish! But then, in his greed, he steals the treasure sack off the table and runs off before the hermit can protest."
23,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_052","'Course he was a damn fool to try, 'cause the hermit gets their own back in the end. Curses Gunitt and transforms him into a twisted fiend for his avarice. Also sank his ship while he was making his escape for good measure."
24,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBTEMPEST_00619_JUDRIC_000_053","And so Gunitt was consigned to the bottom of the sea where he has wandered to this day. They say his covetous nature still rules him, as when the denizens of the depths attempt to consume their prey, he will appear to steal it out from under them."
