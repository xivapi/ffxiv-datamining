1,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RENRAKU_000_010","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! How might I be of service?"
2,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_Q1_000_000","What will you do?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_A1_000_003","Ask about Eden."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_018","Information regarding the work being carried out in the Empty is treated with the utmost secrecy. To avoid it falling into the wrong hands, we limit the keeping of records and such to the bare minimum."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_019","Having said that, it does become rather difficult to keep track of the supplies that we deliver, so I have asked Ryne to provide reports on your activities."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_020","The first such report will cover the time from your arrival in the Empty to your battle with Titan."
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_021","Though, truth be told, I cannot help feeling that this was rather a large burden to place on Ryne. No doubt she has enough on her plate as it is..."
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_022","Lewrey, I did what you asked!"
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_100_022","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Just the person I was hoping to see."
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_023","Oh, is that so? Well, before we go any further, please allow me to take receipt of the report."
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_024","And I hope you do not think it impertinent of me to ask, but what business might you have with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_025","Actually, I've brought something to show you."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_026","Thancred and Urianger brought this back from Eden's core."
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_100_026","If you look closely, you can see images of your battles in the Empty."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_027","Urianger seems to think they are Eden's memories, captured in crystal form. Would you like to see?"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_SYSTEM_100_027","As you gaze into the crystal, visions of previous struggles race through your mind, with an intensity that far exceeds anything you have experienced."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_028","What's wrong!?"
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_029","Different from how you remember it? How odd. What could cause Eden's memories to become so distorted?"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_030","Well, we've been extracting and realigning enormous amounts of aether. Maybe that affected the crystal in some way?"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_031",""
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_032","Even so, I expect that we can find a use for this extraordinary artifact."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_032","I think I have an idea. Although it shows images of things that never actually happened, studying them may help us to prepare for the challenges we'll face in the future."
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_033","Speaking of studying, Urianger's given me a few tomes to read through before our next expedition. I'd best get back to it, but I'll be seeing you again soon."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_200","Ryne informs me that balance has now been restored to all six elements in the Empty."
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_201","As such, representatives from the Crystarium will be making regular visits to the camp to observe any changes that occur. I shall oversee the delivery of whatever supplies they may require."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_202","Once again, Ryne has kindly agreed to provide a report of your travails in the Empty, up to and including the encounter with the being known as Shiva. The preliminary verbal account left me gobsmacked to say the least!"
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_203","Lewrey! I've finally finished."
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_204","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, how goes it? Actually, there was something I wanted to ask you."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_205","Don't worry, it's nothing dangerous! I was wondering if you'd like to join Gaia and I for some traditional Mord Souq <If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),12))><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),4))>evening<Else/>morning</If><Else/><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),17))>afternoon<Else/>evening</If></If> tea?"
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_206","And in the meantime, I can read through your report."
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_207","Now that's taken care of, let's head over to the tea stall!"
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_208","Before that, there's one more thing. This concerns you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
34,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_209","I found this in Eden's core, and it seemed like it could be important. For all I know, it might even help me get my memories back."
35,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_210","But when I look at it more closely, I see images of you swirling around inside it. Whatever this is, it probably means a lot more to you than it does to me."
36,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_211","This crystal contains Eden's memories. We've seen one of these before, haven't we?"
37,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_SYSTEM_000_212","As you stare intently at the crystal, your mind is overwhelmed with visions of struggles past, twisted and distorted by some unknown force."
38,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_100_212","Whatever is the matter?"
39,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_213","It's the same as last time... The only explanation I can think of is that Eden's own power altered its memories somehow. But was that before or after they were crystallized?"
40,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_214","What difference does it make? Regardless of how it was made and where it came from, I can't think of any possible use for this thing. If you want it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, it's yours."
41,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_215","<sigh> It looks like I was the one wasting time on this occasion. Let's go and try this tea I've heard so much about."
42,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_216","Gaia, wait a moment!"
43,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_217","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you're still looking a bit green around the gills, so perhaps you can join us next time instead. Anyway, I'd best catch up with Gaia!"
44,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_218","Hmm... While this crystal may not serve as an accurate record of your battles, it provides a glimpse at what might have been. It could even help in mentally preparing yourself for foes you have yet to face."
45,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_219","Since it contains images of you and your exploits, it seems only right that you should be the one to safeguard it."
46,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_400","That strange girl you met in the Empty is in our custody."
47,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_100_400","Her location is a closely guarded secret, and she is being monitored night and day for any changes in her condition."
48,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_401","We have also been treating any information regarding your mission as strictly confidential. It would cause quite a stir amongst the peoples of Norvrandt were it to become public knowledge, and we cannot afford for anyone to interfere with our work."
49,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_402","Fortunately, the majority of the tasks we perform─such as delivering supplies and equipment─tend to go unnoticed for the most part. In order to maintain this status quo, I and my colleagues will continue to lend our support in as discreet a manner as possible."

51,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_410","Gaia's vague memories of her life in Eulmore led us to her former residence."
52,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_411","Unfortunately, no one in the neighboring area had any recollection of her. It seems she had very little in the way of meaningful contact with those outside of her immediate family."
53,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_412","Having said that, Eulmore has undergone a considerable upheaval of late, so perhaps with time, we may yet uncover some information regarding Gaia's past."
54,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_413","I, for one, find it hard to believe someone as outspoken as Gaia would go unnoticed. Even for a Eulmoran, she strikes me as particularly abrasi─ Forgive me, I very nearly spoke out of turn..."
55,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_420","I was as pleased as anyone in our inner circle to hear that greenery has at long last begun to grow in the Empty."
56,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_421","Ah, to think that our endeavors should finally bear fruit! Perhaps it is a little early to be using that turn of phrase, although I daresay it is only a matter of time until it is true in both a figurative and a literal sense!"
57,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_422","As for Gaia, we have arranged accommodation for her in the Crystarium."
58,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_423","Though it may be some time before her memories return, we aim to make her stay as comfortable as possible. And who knows, she may even come to prefer it over Eulmore!"
