1,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_002","Hey there, fellow Nutter. If you're after a mark or two, might be ol' Haline could put you on their trail. What would you like to know?"

9,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_050","Story goes that there was this fellow way back when. Bloody obsessed with all things fishing and with a penchant for strange ideas. Heads to Malikah's Well one day to take the air and to try something new."
10,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_051","He'd caught a small but lively little worm swimming about in the sand, and reckoned it'd make for fine bait. Goes to stick the hook in, when what does the little bugger do but jump right out of his hands and escape."
11,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_052","Fair bit of time passes before the notorious worm makes its first appearance. Just how it got so big is anyone's guess, but some speculate that it was that same worm, grown fat and strong off all kinds of fish in the well, hence the moniker."
12,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_100","This all dates back to when Nuvy's Leavings was still bustling with activity. The tunnels were dark─as tunnels generally are─and children kept stirring up trouble with rumors that they'd been seeing ghosts."
13,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_101","Ghosts of miners who died in a cave-in after digging too deep, or poor put-upon laborers tasked with hauling materials back for potters─all kinds of silly stories and then some."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_102","Recently, however, this musty old tome came to light. Belonged to a mage of Nabaath Areng, who kept detailed records of his experiments. Apparently he decided to condemn one such “experiment” to a particularly deep tunnel, right around the time the whispers of ghosts first started."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_103","So that there's your logical explanation, if you're looking for it. A misshapen fiend that shouldn't be has been stirring up trouble for years and years. Or it's been killing folks for years and years, and ghosts are real. You tell me."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_150","Here's a language lesson for you: Malik means “king” or some such in the old tongue, so take a wild guess what Maliktender means. That's right."
17,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_151","You'll know him when you see him. Picture a gigantender, then picture his ornery liege lord. And there you have it."
18,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_152","Some scholars say that the damned things can live more than two hundred years in the right conditions, which means this bugger could have been shambling about since before the Flood, for all we know..."

20,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_200","People often focus on the material losses, but the Flood is also responsible for depriving us of wisdom and knowledge─and no few religious traditions. Without people to pass them down to, faiths wither and die. But some survived, and with them stories, like that of the demon Sugaar."
21,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_201","It's a simple tale, to be fair. “Listen to what your elders say, or Sugaar will come and spirit you away.” It helped too that it was a big, scary lizard."
22,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_202","So when a particularly large sibilus was seen wandering Amh Araeng, it's no surprise that people thought to name it for the legend. Nevertheless, it's probably prudent not to ignore the wisdom of the aged, eh?"

24,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_250","Tarchia is a saichaniae that plays host to parasitic vegetation that feeds off its host's aether. Poor bugger, eh? It's awfully difficult to track down, but it is said to be somewhat, er...excitable in the presence of death."
25,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_251","I reckon it's anticipating the impending release of aether. Like if someone were to wave a freshly cooked haunch of mole meat under your nose."
26,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_252","That said, not all deaths are created equal. The flashier the better, if that makes any sort of sense?"
27,"TEXT_CTSHNT50RISKYMOBAMHARAENG_00616_HALINE_000_253","Distance is key too, I'd imagine. No point in putting on a show if the host is nowhere nearby. Maybe something explosively loud, too? I don't know, you'll probably think of something if you put your mind to it."
