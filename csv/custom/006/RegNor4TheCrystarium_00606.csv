2,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_011","Now, is there anything I can help you with?"
3,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_020","Have you seen the night sky? Truly looked at it, in all its majesty? I had read of it, of course, but could never have imagined such splendor."
4,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_021","...I doubt you're here to listen to me carry on, however. Can I help you with anything?"
5,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_030","Though I admit to having felt no small amount of worry myself upon hearing that the Eulmoran Army was in Lakeland, I have it on good authority that the Crystarium is safe at present. Please, relax and enjoy the city."
6,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_031","Of course, if you have any questions, I would be happy to assist you."
7,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_040","I understand that you may have some doubts, given that you've likely never seen such a thing before, but you have my assurance that the barrier around the city will keep us safe from the sin eaters until the guard can drive them away. Please remain calm."
8,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_041","If you have any questions in the meantime, I would be more than happy to answer them."

10,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_051","But fretting over it will avail us naught. What might I do for you?"
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_060","It's a true pity that the night was taken from us again so soon...but there's nothing for it but to carry on. As we always do."
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_061","Now, what can I do for you?"
13,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_070","It's down to all of us to take care of the Crystarium in the Exarch's place. Falling apart in his absence would be a poor way to repay his kindness."
14,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_071","That being the case─is there anything I can do for you?"
15,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_080","The Warrior of Darkness, in the flesh! What can I do for you?"

21,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_100","I'm Bethard─born and raised in the Crystarium, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
22,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_101","I'm intimately familiar with all that the city has to offer, of course, and I've always enjoyed sharing my knowledge with travelers and newcomers. It's become something of an unofficial job for me."
23,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_200","The Crystarium grew up under the auspices of the Crystal Exarch in the wake of the Flood. It is, and always has been, a refuge for those fleeing the damage and twisted corruption wrought by the Light and its minions."
24,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_201","We're also the only ones still wont to fight back, nearly a century after the world's end began. That's why some consider the Crystarium to be the final bastion against the Light that would consume us─the last true hope of mankind."
25,"TEXT_REGNOR4THECRYSTARIUM_00606_BETHARD_000_202","Now that the Light no longer threatens, however, we shall become something else. The roots from which a new world will grow, perhaps."
