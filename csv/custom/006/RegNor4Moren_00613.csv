1,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_010","The contents of a book may be immutable, yet depending upon one's perspective, the lesson one learns may be different indeed. In other words, I am very much in favor of revisiting a story one has already read!"
2,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_020","Will you be joining efforts to repel the sin eaters from Holminster Switch? If so, mayhap a quick review of your foe would prove beneficial..."
3,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_030","<sigh> Whenever I attempt to focus on a task, my mind returns to the memory of that jewel-studded night sky."
4,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_031","What words could hope to encapsulate that dream-like vista─the indescribable emotion which did swell within my breast? Mayhap I shall spend this day browsing our shelves of poetry..."
5,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_040","Do you wish to revisit Minfilia's tale? I shall even fetch the book myself this time!"
6,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_050","Of late, the Cabinet has had an influx of borrowers─citizens seeking the wisdom to understand this changing world. I only wish certain patrons were less, uh, <Emphasis>enthusiastic</Emphasis> with their handling of our books..."
7,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_060","My apologies, but mayhap now is not the most opportune time for a conversation. Let us first see to the safety of the Cabinet and its visitors!"
8,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_070","We are fortunate that those who came before us had the foresight to record not only their triumphs, but their failures as well. Will you take advantage of their woeful experience...?"
9,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_080","...If only the Exarch were not─ Nay, such laments are futile. Mayhap there is something <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> can do..."
10,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_090","I could not say why, but recounting the Exarch's story for you seems to have brought me a measure of calm..."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_091","Mayhap it is the sense of the familiar, helping to ground me in this moment of chaos. Might another such familiar tale aid you in finding your direction?"
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_100","Welcome, welcome! Will you be revisiting old material today? Or breaching a new subject entirely, perchance?"
13,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_110","That was a most riveting recount of the Warriors of Light and their exploits. The Exarch has spoken of them before in some detail, but that they would go to such lengths to try and save our world..."
14,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_111","And knowing of their sacrifices, to see Ardbert once more among the living filled me with great joy. Or rather, it should have. It would put my mind at ease to better understand the how or why of his return. "
15,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_120","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I don't suppose you've come to tell me of a preternatural shower of stars as well? I rushed outside to see for myself, but there was naught but clouds and blue skies when last I looked. It is said that Ardbert is somehow related to, if not the cause of, this strange phenomenon."
16,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_121","I have pored over near every tome here in the Cabinet, hopeful that I might discover something to explain what is happening. Alas... These are truly strange times, my friend."
17,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_130","We didn't quite get to the end of my materials, but hopefully what little I could share of the Warrior of Light will be of use to you."
18,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_140","Words and knowledge are wont to change with the age. In experiencing this firsthand, I find I have developed an even greater appreciation for what we have in the Cabinet."
19,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_141","From a glimpse of the world before the Flood to a portrait of the heroes who arose in its wake, I pray that all the knowledge gathered here shall ever be available to those who seek it out generations hence."

27,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_510","Splendid. Allow me to locate an appropriately eye-catching volume, and we shall commence your revision!"
28,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_511","A hundred years ago─or near enough not to matter─villains known as the Warriors of Light slew the Shadowkeeper, the steward of Darkness."
29,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_512","In the wake of this tainted deed, Light began to pour into the world as if from unseen cracks. It pooled and swelled without cease, until the day an enormous, blinding wave rose up and swept across our star."
30,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_513","We called this calamity the “Flood of Light.”
Everything it touched was leeched of life and vigor, leaving naught behind but a luminous wasteland."
31,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_514","Yet just when it seemed that all would be lost, a savior appeared before us..."
32,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_515","The Oracle of Light. She stood 'twixt us and approaching doom, and by her power did she stay the Flood. Thus was Norvrandt, and Norvrandt alone, spared the fate of erasure."
33,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_516","Tragedy would, however, arrive in another form. From the blasted emptiness descended horrors of strange and terrible aspect to bedevil the few folk who survived."
34,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_517","These “sin eaters” were Light incarnate, and their fulgent presence stole the night from Norvrandt's sky."
35,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_518","Even now, they circle the remaining bastions of civilization, ever on the hunt for us, ever hungering for our flesh..."
36,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_519","...And so concludes this tale of modern history. I wonder if mankind's battle with the sin eaters will find its end within our lifetimes..."
37,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_520","...And so concludes this tale of modern history─though mayhap 'tis time I made some few amendments. Yes, a new chapter to illustrate the sin eaters' downfall!"
38,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_521","...And so concludes this tale of modern history─though mayhap 'tis time I made some few amendments. Indeed, the truth of the Warriors of Light and all the good they have done for us has remained unwritten for far too long!"
39,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_530","Very good. Then let us once more delve into <Emphasis>The Illustrated Tale of the Oracle of Light</Emphasis>."
40,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_531","It began a hundred years ago, when the Flood of Light threatened to swallow Norvrandt. Just as all seemed lost, a savior appeared who halted the all-consuming radiance. A maiden with hair of spun gold and eyes of clearest sapphire."
41,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_532","Naught was known about her save that her name was Minfilia. And for delivering the realm, she came to be revered as the Oracle of Light."
42,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_533","After stopping the Flood, the mysterious maiden vanished without a trace. But fifteen years later, her name would unexpectedly reappear in the annals of history."
43,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_534","When sin eaters laid ruin to the Kingdom of Voeburt, a young girl was discovered who was immune to the creatures' blighted touch."
44,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_535","...One with hair of spun gold and eyes of clearest sapphire. She was hailed as the Oracle reborn and came to likewise be called Minfilia."
45,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_536","Enlisting in the Eulmoran Army, this Minfilia fought and vanquished countless sin eaters."
46,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_537","Alas, like so many other soldiers, she eventually met her end in battle."
47,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_538","Yet with her dying breath, she whispered unto her grieving comrades, “Minfilia will return.”"
48,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_539","And true to her words, some years later, another young girl was discovered who possessed the selfsame eyes, that selfsame hair, and those selfsame powers."
49,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_540","She too took the name Minfilia. She too fought sin eaters as a soldier of Eulmore. And she too fell in battle. Many more were to follow in her footsteps. And so the cycle continues to this day."
50,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_541","...And that concludes the tale. Minfilia has taught us much about the nature of the sin eaters, yet hers has been a heavy burden to bear."
51,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_542","...And that concludes the tale as it has been told. It seems, however, that this most recent Oracle of Light stands apart from the others."
52,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_543","Though 'tis not my place to scrutinize, I am most curious as to─ Nay. Nay, I shall contain my inquisitive nature."
53,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_544","I will say only this: I shall be joyous to hear that the story of these girls and their sorrowful fate has at last been given the ending it deserves."
54,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_550","...What's this? A tale for the history books, you say? W-Well, then, I should be very interested to hear it!"
55,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_551","...B-But this is extraordinary! The Warriors of Light were not as I imagined them..."
56,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_552","Their weary souls, standing at Minfilia's side to halt the very Flood they caused... And Ardbert, lending you his strength as you fought for the First!"
57,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_553","M-My mind is in a whirl, I must... Yes! I must record these revelations on parchment! There must needs be a new chapter written─a revised account!"
58,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_554","Do you not see, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!? This all comes back to the words the Exarch spoke to the people of the Crystarium."
59,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_555","“We shall fight on, that our children and our children's children might know a better tomorrow.” The Warriors of Light were the very embodiment of that sentiment!"
60,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_556","...I should speak with Cyella to learn more? You mean the server, yes? At the Wandering Stairs?"
61,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_557","Hm. I have never known her to be a borrower of history books... But if you are adamant she has truths to share, then I shall be sure to pay her a visit!"
62,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_560","There is no mention of anything you have told us in the books here in the Cabinet."
63,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_570","Hmmm... Perhaps it is time I made a contribution to our collection of works."
