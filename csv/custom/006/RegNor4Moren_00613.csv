1,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_010","The contents of a book may be immutable, yet depending upon one's perspective, the lesson one learns may be different indeed. In other words, I am very much in favor of revisiting a story one has already read!"

19,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_511","A hundred years ago─or near enough not to matter─villains known as the Warriors of Light slew the Shadowkeeper, the steward of Darkness."
20,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_512","In the wake of this tainted deed, Light began to pour into the world as if from unseen cracks. It pooled and swelled without cease, until the day an enormous, blinding wave rose up and swept across our star."
21,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_513","We called this calamity the “Flood of Light.”

30,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_531","It began a hundred years ago, when the Flood of Light threatened to swallow Norvrandt. Just as all seemed lost, a savior appeared who halted the all-consuming radiance. A maiden with hair of spun gold and eyes of clearest sapphire."
31,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_532","Naught was known about her save that her name was Minfilia. And for delivering the realm, she came to be revered as the Oracle of Light."

34,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_535","...One with hair of spun gold and eyes of clearest sapphire. She was hailed as the Oracle reborn and came to likewise be called Minfilia."
35,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_536","Enlisting in the Eulmoran Army, this Minfilia fought and vanquished countless sin eaters."
36,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_537","Alas, like so many other soldiers, she eventually met her end in battle."
37,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_538","Yet with her dying breath, she whispered unto her grieving comrades, “Minfilia will return.”"
38,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_539","And true to her words, some years later, another young girl was discovered who possessed the selfsame eyes, that selfsame hair, and those selfsame powers."
39,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_540","She too took the name Minfilia. She too fought sin eaters as a soldier of Eulmore. And she too fell in battle. Many more were to follow in her footsteps. And so the cycle continues to this day."
40,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_541","...And that concludes the tale. Minfilia has taught us much about the nature of the sin eaters, yet hers has been a heavy burden to bear.."
41,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_542","...And that concludes the tale as it has been told. It seems, however, that this most recent Oracle of Light stands apart from the others."

45,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_551","...B-But this is extraordinary! The Warriors of Light were not as I imagined them..."
46,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_552","Their weary souls, standing at Minfilia's side to halt the very Flood they caused... And Ardbert, lending you his strength as you fought for the First!"
47,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_553","M-My mind is in a whirl, I must... Yes! I must record these revelations on parchment! There must needs be a new chapter written─a revised account!"

49,"TEXT_REGNOR4MOREN_00613_MOREN_000_555","“We shall fight on, that our children and our children's children might know a better tomorrow.” The Warriors of Light were the very embodiment of that sentiment!"
