Given what we know of the soul, that you possessed distinct memories should have rendered the process more complicated. Though I but theorize, perhaps your strong and shared desire to do so made it possible."
48,"TEXT_REGNOR4CRYSTALEXARCH_00611_GRAHATIA_000_707","In contrast, I simply merged with myself. Whatever additional experiences the older me may have had, my fundamental existence remained unchanged. Mind you, that's not to say that I hadn't improved! Far from it!"
49,"TEXT_REGNOR4CRYSTALEXARCH_00611_GRAHATIA_000_708","At any rate, when our souls combined, it shouldn't have been a process of augmentation, but rather...shall we say, attunement. It seems somewhat strange that my soul has become denser."
