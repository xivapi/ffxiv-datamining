1,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_030_001","There is still much we must do to prepare, but if there is aught else you wish to discuss...?"
2,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_030_005","The imperial forces have retreated, allowing us to retake Utya's Aegis. Bajsaljen requests your presence there at your earliest convenience."
3,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_030_006","Is there aught you wished to discuss before leaving?"
4,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_030_010","I understand that you are no stranger to battle with the Empire. Having crossed blades with such a redoubtable foe before, I must ask─do you believe there is any chance of success for the Resistance?"
5,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_030_011","Now that the fighting has begun in earnest, I cannot help but wonder if our troops can endure the bloodshed required of them. They say they are prepared, willing to lay down their lives for Bozja. And yet... "
6,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_030_012","Forgive me. Such dispirited thinking will accomplish nothing."
7,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_030_013","Ahem. If there is nothing else you wish to discuss, I will leave you to your affairs."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_Q30_000_000","What will you say?"
9,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_A30_000_000","Tell me about Queen Gunnhildr."
10,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_A30_000_001","Tell me about Gunnhildr's Blades."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_A30_000_002","Tell me about the weapons you plan to forge."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_A30_000_003","Tell me about yourself."
13,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_A30_000_0010","Nothing."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_200","During the Third Astral Era, Queen Gunnhildr united the fragmented tribes of the Hrothgar to rise up and drove off the Allagans, eventually going on to found the nation of Bozja."
15,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_201","It should be noted that Gunnhildr was not her name, but rather a title bestowed to the current monarch of any given age. The common thread connecting all rulers of Bozja is their ability to read the stars. There were others who shared in this ability, but they were said to be the greatest seers of their respective ages."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_202","They were also said to be great warriors. When doing battle with the Allagans or any other would-be invaders, the queen could always be found commanding from the front lines."
17,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_203","Alas, Bozja would fall in the wake of the Fourth Umbral Calamity. By some miracle, some few survived and were able to build what we knew as the city-state of Bozja."
18,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_300","They were the elite guard of the queen, masters of myriad arms and magicks, said to be the greatest warriors of their age."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_301","Their combat prowess was matched only by their devotion to Queen Gunnhildr. They would not hesitate to give their lives in her service. And, should one of these warriors fall in battle, their holy blade would be passed on to a suitable successor."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_302","Over time, their title as Gunnhildr's Blades would become synonymous with the gunblade, which gained great renown during the war against the Allagans."
21,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_303","There is not a Bozjan alive who does not know the tales of their heroism. I have no doubt reforging these weapons will lend us both the strength and resolve we need to succeed."
22,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_400","With Master Gerolt's help, we have nearly all that is required to reforge the weapons of Queen Gunnhildr's guard."
23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_401","While it is true the legends of their might are duly inspiring, to simply call them the blades of Gunnhildr would do little to differentiate these new armaments from the weapons of eld. After all, we do not wish to give the impression that the originals have been recovered."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_402","After much thought, Master Gerolt offered a simple and surprisingly satisfactory suggestion of “Resistance weapons.”"
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_403","He also went on to make a rather curious remark about the steps to be taken in their forging: that these weapons can be enhanced further in accordance with the enemies one faces."
26,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_404","By the sounds of it, these weapons are never truly complete until their purpose is fulfilled."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_500","It has been two years since I joined the Resistance. Before then I lived as all Bozjans did─under the harsh rule of the Empire."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_501","It is the only life I have ever known, though my parents often spoke to me of what they remembered from the days of Bozja's independence."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_502","Though it was under the auspices of our Garlean oppressors, I was educated in prehistoric archaeology."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_503","While I am thankful for the opportunities it afforded me, I could not turn a blind eye to the suffering of my people. And so I left to join the Resistance."
31,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMEESIYA_00662_MEESIYA_400_504","It was I who proposed to reforge the fabled weapons of Queen Gunnhildr's guard, and Bajsaljen has chosen to place his faith in my plan. I take heart in knowing all I learned from the Empire will be put to good use."
