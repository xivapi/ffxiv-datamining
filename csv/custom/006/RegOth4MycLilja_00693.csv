23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_001","Ahem. The idea for it originally came from Mikoto, and the chief─genius that he is─was able to put her ideas to paper. After that, all it took was a little ingenuity from our engineers to bring everything together."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_002","After the sensors are in place and turned on, they analyze the aether currents running through the area, and that data is tracked by our monitors here."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_003","What makes it so invaluable to our plans is its ability to distinguish between varying aetherial signatures. The large aether currents we're tracking are like giant rivers fed by streams of different kinds of aether. But with the spectrometer, we can easily pick out the specific one we need. Fascinating stuff, isn't it?"
26,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_100","The what? Oh, right. The chief picked it up on one of his scavenging trips to Allagan ruins somewhere. It's been surprisingly nice to have around. Goodness knows I can't keep track of everything going on here."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_101","Jessie asked that I keep it on at all times. Between you and me, though, I think she just wants to keep a close eye on me. Whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'm not sure."

29,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_201","Can't imagine we have many common interests. I'd make for terrible company, what with you being the savior of Eorzea, while I'm just a... Oh gods..."
