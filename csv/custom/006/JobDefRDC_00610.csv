2,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_A1_000_001","How fare you of late?"
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_A1_000_002","What is a dancer?"
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_010","From Coerthas to Thanalan, La Noscea to Gyr Abania...we have been to every corner of this realm, and nigh every settlement in between. And everywhere we go, we are greeted with a chorus of cheers for our performance."
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_011","Though the Totentanz still threatens to rear its ugly head from time to time, Ranaa has seen to it that not one man has fallen to its clutches."
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_012","Nashmeira's injury has healed as well. Though it will take her a while still to fully regain her stamina, Troupe Falsiam's reputation has only grown with our principal's return to the stage."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_020","Hmm? Ah, but of course. Given your great skill, I often forget that you are a relative newcomer to our ranks. Very well then, where should I begin?"
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_021","“Dancers” in our parlance refer to the shining stars of our company, Troupe Falsiam─those who have inherited the Kriegstanz, the ancient form of dance that predates the very founding of our fair city..."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_022","As to when and how the Kriegstanz first originated, none can truly say. But one thing is for certain: it is a dance meant as much for the battlefield as it is for the stage."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_023","The whirling, twirling motions of our dancers strike at our foes, and rouse the passions of our friends, casting out the shadows of fear and doubt and bringing out a strength of spirit they knew not they had."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_024","Some even say our art is akin to a form of magic. But with great power comes great responsibility─and Troupe Falsiam has long kept a secret known handed down from principal to principal across generations. A secret that Mistress Nashmeira only recently did share with us..."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_025","I speak of course of our role in battling the Totentanz, the dance of the damned."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_026","In times of calamity and strife, when the hearts of men are plagued by deep-rooted doubts and fears, so does that accursed dance ever loom, waiting to prey upon the suffering."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_027","While it remains just a theory, it is believed that these shadows of the heart resonate with the aether in the air and earth around us, thus becoming amplified and spreading further."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_028","In the end, so powerful do these aetheric shadows come, that those afflicted lose control of both body and mind, their limbs flailing and twisting with grotesque, violent, and ceaseless motions. This is the phenomenon we know as the Totentanz."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_029","In touring the five nations of Eorzea with our troupe, you witnessed with your own two eyes the threat of which I speak."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_KUIHLUD_000_030","And yet, thanks in no small part to the efforts of Ranaa and yourself, the full horror of the Totentanz was averted...and for this, Troupe Falsiam and the entire realm are in your debt."
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_100","Oh, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Aren't you a sight for sore eyes in these far-flung lands? I trust you're still dancing up a storm these days?"
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_Q1_000_100","What will you ask?"
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_A1_000_101","How fare you of late?"
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_A1_000_102","What is a dancer?"
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_A1_000_103","Nothing."
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_110","It hasn't been easily filling Mistress Nashmeira's shoes, but I'm proud to say that we've sold out every show thus far! It would appear that our Hingan hosts find Hannish music and dance most exotic."
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_111","Needless to say, I couldn't have done it without the support of my fellow troupemates. And you, of course─why, just recalling our time on the stage together is often all I need to muster the courage to carry on."
26,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_112","And yet, I know better than to rest on my laurels─Mistress Nashmeira taught me better than that. I must always strive to find new ways to shock and stimulate my audience, lest we too become just another passing fad."
27,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_113","And so I press onward, vowing to myself that each day I will strive to be a better dancer than I was the day before. Promise me that you will do the same, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, that one day we might again share the same stage!"
28,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_150","These are dark times, but the show at the Mujikoza goes on, and so I continue to take the stage and dance."
29,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_151","Of course, I worry for my homeland of Radz–at–Han. And yet the people of Kugane, too, require succor. If my dancing can keep spirits high amidst all the uncertainty, then I have done my duty as a dancer."
30,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_152","Besides, rumor about town has it that you've been something of a regular presence in Thavnair of late."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_153","So it <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> true! Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Knowing that, I would continue to do what I can for those around me, taking comfort in knowing that my home is in good hands."
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_120","What a curious question. Why, a dancer is what I am...and what you are, for that matter. Oh, but perhaps you wish to review the history of our art? Very well, then..."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_121","“Dancers” are the shining stars of Troupe Falsiam─that's us! We are the proud inheritors of the Kriegstanz, an ancient form of dance they say dates even before the founding of Radz–at–Han...can you believe it?"
34,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_122","The origins of our art are shrouded in mystery, but there's one thing we know for sure: we are equally at home in battle as they are on the stage."
35,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_123","With one motion, we strike at our foes, and with the next, we lift the spirits of our friends, helping them find strength and courage even when they are staring death in the face!"
36,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_124","And so it is our calling to travel the realm, bringing hope and cheer to the downtrodden and the suffering. And yet, our true mission goes even deeper than that, as we learned when Mistress Nashmeira shared with us her long-kept secret."
37,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_125","For ages, we dancers have been soldiers on the front lines in the battle against the unholy force we know as the Totentanz."
38,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_126","In times of calamity and strife, when people are at their wits' end, the Totentanz lurks in the shadows, just waiting to pounce and prey upon poor and unfortunate souls."
39,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_127","It's not my area of expertise, but Kuihlud tells me that pangs of anger and sorrow that men feel cause a reaction somehow with the aether in the air, causing the darkness in their hearts to spread to those around them."
40,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_128","Before they know it, they've lost control of both body and mind, flailing about violently. I've heard horrific tales of men who trampled their best friends, or wrenched their own limbs off!"
41,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_129","This is the threat that you and I faced with Mistress Nashmeira's aid. Fortunately, we were able to dispel the shadows before any of the people of Eorzea suffered such a terrible fate."
42,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_130","Since then, we have been flooded with requests from those wishing to join our ranks. And so Mistress Nashmeira entrusted the role of principal to yours truly, so that she could stay behind and train the next generation of dancers in Eorzea."
43,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDC_00610_RANAAMIHGO_000_131","While the threat of the Totentanz can never be truly eliminated─not as long as fear and resentment still fester in the hearts of men─I can safely say Troupe Falsiam is better equipped than ever to deal with the menace!"
