2,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_010","Oh, this is a welcome surprise! So, what do you think of our school? With a roof and sturdy walls, we can study without worrying about the weather."
3,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_011","On the other hand, the bookshelves are looking rather empty. I have my own copies of most of the texts, but listening to me reading them aloud does nothing for the children's literacy."
4,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_012","Luckily, for today's lesson on Rissai, we have all the books we need. Are you familiar with this pivotal figure?"

11,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_019","Unlike most others at the time, it was not only for the children of samurai or those of high social standing, but for everyone. Rich or poor, all were accepted as students."
12,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_020","The school held a special place in our community and remained open after his death, with some of his former pupils becoming tutors themselves."

15,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_023","Yes, I was. I spent many happy years at the Rissai-juku, first as a pupil and later as a teacher. But all that came to an end when the Garleans invaded. They closed the school and sought to undo all the good it had done."
16,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_024","Even so, some of the older generation, such as myself, continued to teach Doman values in secret. The lessons we used to have together were one such example."
17,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_025","But now that the Empire is gone, we can teach as we please, without fear of reprisal. That is why I decided to reopen Rissai-juku."
18,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_026","The decades of oppression could not crush the Doman spirit. Much like the shazenso, we survive even under the harshest conditions. When they cut us down, we sprout anew, because our roots are strong."

25,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_035","It brings me great joy to have such attentive pupils. Were it not for your donations, we would have nowhere to study. May the kami bless you."

35,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_049","They have been through so much, at such a young age, which often forces children to grow up quickly. But it is more than that, I feel."
36,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTMINAZUKI_00526_MINAZUKI_000_050","I think that all that hardship has taught them to appreciate the good times. Perhaps they have come to truly understand the joy that freedom can bring."
