4,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_010","Much the same as everyone else, I s'pose─just tryin' to survive. Used to be a fisherman, but then I got it into my head that Eulmore was the place for me. No more shiverin' on a boat, or scalin' fish in a shack, no sir."

11,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_023","Though as it happens, I hear them scraps weren't just some kind of fancy bread. They say we've been eatin' <Emphasis>eaters</Emphasis>. Ugh, when I think of how much meol I've wolfed down, it makes me sick to my stomach."
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_024","Then there's what happened down here, when things was going to pieces up there. All the old guard started muttering nonsense at the same bloody time, like they was caught under some sort of spell. Not sure what to make of that..."
