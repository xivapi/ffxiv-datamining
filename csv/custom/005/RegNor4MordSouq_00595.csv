1,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_010","These are dark days... Which is a good thing! Well, dark at night anyway."
2,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_020","No more nights? Why not? Did we run out of darkness? Oh, I am sorry to ask you so many questions, when you clearly have no idea how to answer them. Or perhaps you have a question for me?"
3,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_030","The night has returned! And if the day could disappear altogether, I will be even happier!"
4,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
5,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_A1_000_001","What do you do here?"
6,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_A1_000_002","What kind of place is this?"
7,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_A1_000_003","Nothing."
8,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_100","I am a scavenger! It might sound like we skulk around picking at dead animals─and sometimes we do, to be fair─but our job is to find lost shinies! Your kind call them “relics,” I believe."
9,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_101","We take great pride in our work! Historians want to learn about the past, and we help them! For a price, of course."
10,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_200","All sorts of people come to Mord Souq! Travelers crossing the desert, historians searching for shinies, traders...trading."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_201","But there is one thing they have in common. Jinglies to spend!"
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4MORDSOUQ_00595_GHELGEL_000_202","Of course, if it were not for us scavengers, there would be little to attract such customers. Digging up ancient shinies is our specialty, and if you are looking for something in particular, we can find it for you!"
