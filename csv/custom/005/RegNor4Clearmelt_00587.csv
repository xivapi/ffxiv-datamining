Why, it is all I can do to keep from slipping and falling into the water when making the rounds in the dark. I advise you to watch your footing as well. "

3,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_040","And the endless day has returned. Though it makes it easier for me to watch over the baths, I must say I miss gazing up at the stars in the sky. But enough of my grumblings─what may I do for you today?"

10,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_201","We even get the occasional stray sin eater, and I don't have to tell you they're not here for a relaxing soak. I must remain ever vigilant, that those under my watch are not struck down when they are at their most defenseless."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4CLEARMELT_00587_KEEBOSTT_000_210","Though the horrors brought upon us by the Flood of Light have passed, the worries, aches, and pains we face in our daily lives will never fade away entirely. As long as people want for the succor of our waters, I will watch over the springs and keep them safe."
