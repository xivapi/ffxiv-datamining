I am the nezumi doshin, a member of a Far Eastern delegation come to share our traditions of Heavensturn with the good people of Eorzea. If there is aught you would know of this year's celebration, you need only ask."

4,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_A1_000_3","What is mochi pounding?"
5,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_A1_000_4","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_001","At the turning of the year, a small delegation journeys to Eorzea to herald the coming of Heavensturn and share our traditions. In so doing, we aim to strengthen the bonds of friendship between Eorzea and the Far East."
7,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_002","To mark this occasion, our leader, the nezumi bugyo, has had the uniquely brilliant idea of distributing advent cakes to the people of Limsa Lominsa. Please do try some─they're delicious, and entirely safe to eat!"
8,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_010","Why, we are here to celebrate this most auspicious of Heavensturns, of course! And with far less danger to life and limb, now that we have secured the assistance of helping hands like yours in putting down the mochi."
9,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_011","We will be needing quite a few more advent cakes, of course, and seem to have no shortage of ominously undulating mochi, so your continued aid would be more than welcome!"

12,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_040","You are unfamiliar with this festival? The tradition has a rich history which dates back centuries, but I do not wish to bore you, so I shall try and keep my summation brief."
13,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_041","Heavensturn is a celebration that marks the start of a new year, though the way in which this day is observed differs from region to region. Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Byregot, the Builder, who has been charged with this duty."
14,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_042","In the Far East, however, the changing of the year is heralded by one of twelve totem animals. As you have no doubt discerned from my helm, this year we pay homage to the nezumi, harbinger of fortune."
15,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_043","Ah, but I forget where I am. I believe you Eorzeans call the selfsame creatures “mice.” Or is it “rats”? ...Frankly, I am unsure what the difference is meant to be. Just envision a small rodent."
16,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_050","It is how we create our advent cakes, the staple sweet of Heavensturn in the Far East. We first prepare a sizable portion of steamed rice and place it in a mortar, where it is then pounded into the thick, sticky paste we call mochi."
17,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_051","Though you may find it hard to believe, the pounding of the rice in and of itself is something of a spectacle─particularly this year, I'm given to understand."
18,"TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_052","If you wish to see for yourself, you need only make the short journey to middle La Noscea. You will find the mochi daikan near the Zephyr Drift. Happy pummeling!"
