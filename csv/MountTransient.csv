  - Nanamo Ul Namo"
5,"Five years and a realm-shaking Calamity were not enough to break the bonds between you and your loyal steed. A single whistle and he will be at your side once again.","In the five years following your sudden disappearance from the Carteneau Flats, your ever-faithful chocobo spent each waking moment galloping across the realm in search of his lost master. His myriad adventures are nothing less than fantastical and heartbreaking...but that is a story for another day.","Go find the chocobo you
rode in on, and ride on out.

6,"Call into battle your suit of Garlond Ironworks-modified magitek armor.","This suit of Garlean-developed reaper-class magitek battle armor has had its original control systems purged and replaced with a new, modified core built by Cid of the Garlond Ironworks.","At last, our very own
suit of magitek armor!

8,"Summon your fleet-footed battle coeurl, trained from a pup to recognize you as a friend...not food.","Native to the jungles of the Near East, coeurls were only recently introduced to Eorzea, brought over from faraway lands such as Thavnair by Ul'dahn nobles who thought to breed them as pets. Now, but a handful of skilled tamers living in recluse on the Pearl are
said to be able to train them.","Hey, good lookin'!
Catch my coeurl yet?

9,"Summon forth a riding ahriman, bound to this realm with powerful magicks guaranteed to never fade.","Though little is known of the void and the creatures which call the extra-dimensional realm home, scholars have discovered that there is a strict hierarchy amongst voidsent consisting of twelve distinct tiers. Ahrimans are believed to fall into the fifth, making them formidable foes...when not enthralled by curses.","Ye'd 'ave t' be blinder'n an

19,"Summon your cavalry drake, trained by the drake whisperer of the Brotherhood of Ash.","Training a cavalry drake is a long and arduous process that begins the moment the scalekin hatches. Never allowed to see its mother, the creature is raised solely in the presence of a drake whisperer while being weaned on the incendiary glands of aged battle drakes to ensure it is both submissive and deadly.","You are as a lost kitten

as a romp through the
forest on goobbueback.

21,"Call into battle your gilded suit of magitek armor. Its golden coating serves to resist magicks while impressing members of the opposite sex.","It only took a few heated skirmishes with the allied city–states for Garlemald to realize that the magicks wielded by the realm's mages were too much for even the thickest of magitek armor plating. Alloyed gilding has since been discovered to dampen the effects of elemental charges and is now standard issue.","You ditched your magitek

26,"Summon your cavalry elbst, raised from an egg by Pahh of Novv's Clutch.","To ensure his elbst do not find themselves at a disadvantage to swift-running chocobos, Pahh of Novv's Clutch clips the webbing on their feet at a young age, rendering them more capable of achieving high speeds on land─though they will ever be slower than their brethren while underwater.","My elbst is your elbst.

27,"Summon forth a bevy of bombs who will bear you in comfort upon a hovering palanquin.","Upon learning that his creations were forever lacking the power to combust, 789th Order Acolyte Ba Go did what any master of explosives would─attach the bombs to the corners of an iron bench and create a floating coach.","Hack and slash and

33,"Summon forth your fearless warbear, veteran of a thousand battles, to fill your enemies with dread.","In generations past, warriors seeking fame and glory would journey out into the untamed wilds of Abalathia's Spine in search of the giant grizzled bears that roamed the mountains, and would wrestle the beasts into submission, riding their prizes back to civilization. That is, or die trying.","How do you like my

  - Beast Trainer"
34,"Summon forth your draught chocobo, a massive bird large and strong enough to bear two riders.","This heretofore unseen breed of chocobo was said to have been discovered by chocobo hunters searching for the legendary Chocobo Forest. Its enormous size would make it a fine pack chocobo, but its foul temper prevents it from completing even the simplest of tasks without the injury of some poor rider.","The thing was thrice my

maimed several keeps.
  - Battlewarden Ribald"
35,"Summon forth your deadly direwolf, one of five pups found huddling together in the snow near the corpse of their slain mother.","Mass cullings of the beasts during the Sixth Astral Era prompted naturalists to deem the species extinct.

41,"Summon forth your ceremony chocobo, large enough to bear both you and your special someone.","Raised by Ishgard's master breeders for beauty and purity of stock, its snow white feathers are natural and, though fully developed, as soft as down.

42,"Summon forth Sleipnir─undying steed of the elder primal Odin. His coat is as dark as void, while his eyes glow a sanguine red.","Blessed by the elder primal himself, Sleipnir will forever remain loyal to those who have proven themselves worthy. In addition to being fearless in battle, the dark steed is also able to manipulate his corporeal form to accommodate any rider, large or small.","If it hadn't been

44,"Summon forth your parade chocobo who, by the looks of him, has not marched in many parades.","Originally purchased by the Adventurers' Guild for use in festival parades, this portly steed quickly wore out his welcome by devouring a moon's worth of fodder in a single turn of the sun. Unable to pay the price of upkeep, the guild passed the reins to someone more “commendable.”"," I'll be at the parade with

good, but the true reward is the
exoneration of your comrades.
   - Haurchefant"
46,"Summon forth your adamantoise mount. He(?) is actually quite faster than he appears.","Native to the Near Eastern island of Thavnair, adamantoises were long thought to be impossible to domesticate. However, through the efforts of both Ul'dahn naturalists and thaumaturges, a handful have been successfully trained not only to accept riders, but also wield ancient magicks which allow the colossal scalekin to fly.","M-Me?

48,"Call into battle your Allagan logistics system. For your safety and the safety of those around you, all weaponry has been disabled.","One of the automated system drones deployed by the Allagans to maintain and protect their strongholds.

52,"Summon forth your amber draught chocobo, a rare breed large and strong enough to bear two riders.","To Ishgardians, red represents true love and loyalty.

“manacutters” to be had,

   - Aymeric"
56,"Summon forth your war panther─a silent killer trained to maim anyone and everything...excepting you, of course.","While more difficult to train than their cousins the coeurls, panthers bring their riders much more advantage on the field due to the beasts' inherent affinity to various magic. It is also believed that many dark knight battle techniques were conceived by watching panthers hunt.","I have seen you
