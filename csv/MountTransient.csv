1,"Summon your Grand Company-issued battle chocobo.","Born and bred in the city–state of Ishgard, the majority of company chocobos are geldings of the rouncey variety; however, massive destriers and miniature Belah'dian jennets are also raised to accommodate the builds of Roegadyn and
Lalafellin riders respectively.","Chocobos are stout-
hearted creatures, but
they have their limits.

4,"Use the odd-shaped horn gifted to you by the wandering minstrel to call a massive goobbue to your side.","Traded for a song by the High Satrap of a distant land, the secret to taming these creatures once thought to be unbreakable was introduced to Eorzea by a mysterious wandering minstrel who journeyed through the realm in the final
days before the Calamity.","Would that I had the
girth of a goobbue!
  - Nanamo Ul Namo"
5,"Five years and a realm-shaking Calamity were not enough to break the bonds between you and your loyal steed. A single whistle and he will be at your side once again.","In the five years following your sudden disappearance from the Carteneau Flats, your ever-faithful chocobo spent each waking moment galloping across the realm in search of his lost master. His myriad adventures are nothing less than fantastical
and heartbreaking...but that is
a story for another day.","Go find the chocobo you
rode in on, and ride on out.
  - Sevrin"
6,"Call into battle your suit of Garlond Ironworks-modified magitek armor.","This suit of Garlean-developed reaper-class magitek battle armor has had its original control systems purged and replaced with a new, modified core built by Cid of the Garlond Ironworks.","At last, our very own
suit of magitek armor!
  - Cid Garlond"

8,"Summon your fleet-footed battle coeurl, trained from a pup to recognize you as a friend...not food.","Native to the jungles of the Near East, coeurls were only recently introduced to Eorzea, brought over from faraway lands such as Thavnair by Ul'dahn nobles who thought to breed them as pets. Now, but a handful of skilled tamers living in recluse on the Pearl are
said to be able to train them.","Hey, good lookin'!
Catch my coeurl yet?
  - Swygrael"
9,"Summon forth a riding ahriman, bound to this realm with powerful magicks guaranteed to never fade.","Though little is known of the void and the creatures which call the extra-dimensional realm home, scholars have discovered that there is a strict hierarchy amongst voidsent consisting of twelve distinct tiers. Ahrimans are believed to fall into the fifth, making them formidable foes...
when not enthralled by curses.","Ye'd 'ave t' be blinder'n an

Poaching has caused the population to decline, and if it were not for your act of kindness,
there would be one fewer.","Your precious horses,

Despite objections from friends and family alike,
she kept the beasts, eventually
training them to serve as mounts.","Do not presume to
provoke the behemoth to
battle. You will die.
  - Meurise"
19,"Summon your cavalry drake, trained by the drake whisperer of the Brotherhood of Ash.","Training a cavalry drake is a long and arduous process that begins the moment the scalekin hatches. Never allowed to see its mother, the creature is raised solely in the presence of a drake whisperer while being weaned on the incendiary glands of aged battle
drakes to ensure it is both
submissive and deadly.","You are as a lost kitten
that has wandered into
the drake's lair.
  - Zagozz Teh"
20,"Summon your laurel goobbue, towering friend to the sylphs.","After having the moss and flowers growing upon his head pulled up and tossed aside like common weeds by a band of sylvan ne'er-do-wells, this quiet-mannered goobbue was taken in and cared for by the sylphs of Little Solace whose elders crafted for him
a magnificent laurel with
which to hide his scars.","Naught is as exhilarating
as a romp through the
forest on goobbueback.
  - Unknown"
21,"Call into battle your gilded suit of magitek armor. Its golden coating serves to resist magicks while impressing members of the opposite sex.","It only took a few heated skirmishes with the allied city–states for Garlemald to realize that the magicks wielded by the realm's mages were too much for even the thickest of magitek armor plating. Alloyed gilding has since been discovered to dampen the
effects of elemental charges

armor!? Fool of a Lalafell!

Otherwise untamable, the single piercing tone of a magicked whistle is the only method known to soothe
the savage beasts.","See the nightmare for
reality, and ready thyself

the fat chocobo down.","Huff...huff...heave...heave...
  - Fat Chocobo"
26,"Summon your cavalry elbst, raised from an egg by Pahh of Novv's Clutch.","To ensure his elbst do not find themselves at a disadvantage to swift-running chocobos, Pahh of Novv's Clutch clips the webbing on their feet at a young age, rendering them more capable of achieving high speeds on land. This procedure, however, robs them of their natural-
born ability to swim.","My elbst is your elbst.
  - Pahh"
27,"Summon forth a bevy of bombs who will bear you in comfort upon a hovering palanquin.","Upon learning that his creations were forever lacking the power to combust, 789th Order Acolyte Ba Go did what any master of explosives would─attach the bombs to the corners of an iron bench and create a floating coach.","Hack and slash and
tossy-boom. Bang and

reverted back to a feral state.","I, too, see the friends
I lost in the lions and

  - Gregory"
33,"Summon forth your fearless warbear, veteran of a thousand battles, to fill your enemies with dread.","In generations past, warriors seeking fame and glory would journey out into the untamed wilds of Abalathia's Spine in search of the giant grizzled bears that roamed the mountains, and would wrestle the beasts into submission, riding their prizes back to civilization. That is, or die trying.","How do you like my
pets? Not too playful
for you, I hope?
  - Beast Trainer"
34,"Summon forth your draught chocobo, a massive bird large and strong enough to bear two riders.","This heretofore unseen breed of chocobo was said to have been discovered by chocobo hunters searching for the legendary Chocobo Forest. Its enormous size would make it a fine pack chocobo, but its foul temper prevents it from completing even the simplest of tasks without the injury
of some poor rider.","The thing was thrice my
size and had already
maimed several keeps.
  - Battlewarden Ribald"
35,"Summon forth your deadly direwolf, one of five pups found huddling together in the snow near the corpse of their slain mother.","Mass cullings of the beasts during the Sixth Astral Era prompted naturalists to deem the species extinct. However, this claim was proved false when Ixali scouts discovered a lone pack roaming the sparsely inhabited mountains of Xelphatol.","I lost two good men
to these wolves.
  - Corentiaux the Colder"

  - Uma Bugyo"
41,"Summon forth your ceremony chocobo, large enough to bear both you and your special someone.","Raised by Ishgard's master breeders for beauty and purity of stock, its snow white feathers are natural and, though fully developed, as soft as down. Temperament-wise, the bird is remarkably docile and one of few breeds
who will allow dual
riders upon its back.","Don't stand on ceremony,
tick-tock, tick-tock!
  - Helmhart"
42,"Summon forth Sleipnir─undying steed of the elder primal Odin. His coat is as dark as void, while his eyes glow a sanguine red.","Blessed by the elder primal himself, Sleipnir will forever remain loyal to those who have proven themselves worthy. In addition to being fearless in battle, the dark steed is also able to manipulate his corporeal form to
accommodate any
rider, large or small.","If it hadn't been

   - Erik"
43,"Summon forth Boreas, the legendary steed favored of the primal Shiva. His breath is said to beget the winter's storms.","Legend states that the Lady of Frost, Shiva, birthed this magicked steed from a unicorn offered by her followers in sacrifice.","Nay is but a hoofbeat
away from neigh!
  - Uma Bugyo"
44,"Summon forth your parade chocobo who, by the looks of him, has not marched in many parades.","Originally purchased by the Adventurers' Guild for use in festival parades, this portly steed quickly wore out his welcome by devouring a moon's worth of fodder in a single turn of the sun. Unable to pay the price of upkeep, the guild
passed the reigns to some-
one more “commendable.”"," I'll be at the parade with
whomever else I can drag along.
  - Botulf"
45,"Summon de forth your black de chocobo. ","A purebred Ishgardian black chocobo, trained from birth by House Fortemps knight, Ser Haurchefant, and presented to you in a gesture of true friendship. The bird is slightly more muscular than you expected and exhibits the strange
habit of squatting
when left to itself.","Black chocobos are all well and
good, but the true reward is the
exoneration of your comrades.
   - Haurchefant"
46,"Summon forth your adamantoise mount. He(?) is actually quite faster than he appears.","Native to the Near Eastern island of Thavnair, adamantoises were long thought to be impossible to domesticate. However, through the efforts of both Ul'dahn zoologists and thaumaturges, a handful have been successfully trained not only to accept riders, but also wield ancient magicks which allow the colossal scalekin to fly.","M-Me? Perfectly fine!
S-Solid as an adamantoise!
  - Cocobezi"
47,"Summon forth Kirin, Far Eastern king of the beasts.","Ask any man in Othard who rules the realm of beasts, and you will receive the same answer─Kirin. It is believed that the lion-like creature has walked the eastern lands for over a thousand years and
will only answer the
call of a hero it has
deemed worthy.","Even folk in the Far East
'eard that tale, I reckon.
  - Trachraet"
48,"Call into battle your Allagan logistics system. For your safety and the safety of those around you, all weaponry has been disabled.","One of the automated system drones deployed by the Allagans to maintain and protect their strongholds. After being unearthed by the Sons of Saint Coinach, the mechanical sphere was modified by Nero tol Scaeva into a personal
transportation device.","Her report also mentions a
violent encounter with a

  - Rammbroes"
49,"Summon forth a purebred Abalathian hoarhound named after its pack's legendary leader.","Following the rise of Ishgard, hoarhounds all but disappeared from the Coerthas highlands. However, the shift in climate caused by the Calamity has seen the legendary beasts descend from their mountain dens once more.","A good hound keeps
his maw shut.
   - Latata"
50,"Summon forth Midgardsormr, the slightly bigger one, but still not <Emphasis>the</Emphasis> big one.","Only after proving your bravery in the face of countless perils has the Father of Dragons found you to be a worthy heir to the Light, and granted you a place upon his back.","Correct me if I'm wrong, but
if Midgardsormr had roared,

52,"Summon forth your amber draught chocobo, a rare breed large and strong enough to bear two riders.","To Ishgardians, red represents true love and loyalty.

his yellow brethren.","What about my forty

Wait, he did, until you arrived.","Wild sanuwa fierce

soldiers who would

“manacutters” to be had,

   - Aymeric"
56,"Summon forth your war panther─a silent killer trained to maim anyone and everything...excepting you, of course.","While more difficult to train than their cousins the coeurls, panthers bring their riders much more advantage on the field due to the beasts' inherent affinity to various magic. It is also believed that many dark knight battle techniques
were conceived by
watching panthers hunt.","I have seen you

   - Hildeyerd"
72,"Summon forth your kongamato, raised with care by the Vath stickpeddler.","After hatching from an egg laid near the riverbanks, the kongamato larva spends its early life as a water-dwelling insect. Its maturity is signified by metamorphosis, during which its wings sprout forth and it takes to the skies.","Kongamato can be fickle─yes,
very fickle─but they always

Bismarck is a creature of pure
