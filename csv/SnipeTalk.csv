12,61,1,12,"I can barely see my hand in front of my face. If only that torch were a little closer...","",""
13,61,1,13,"There is nothing to gain from staring at my backside. Now please, I need to concentrate.","",""
14,61,1,14,"Ugh! I would thank you not to shoot me!","",""
15,57,7,0,"For all its reaction, the creature may as well be made of stone. It only stares at you unflinchingly...","",""

20,57,7,0,"...This creature is making no effort to avoid detection. And is also not a Mystel.","",""
21,57,7,0,"The mural appears to be ancient. A warrior in the middle stands triumphant over what appears to be a creature of shadow. Other figures surround the warrior rejoicing in their victory.","",""
22,57,7,0,"The mural appears to be very old. A ruler sits atop a throne, attended by their subjects.","",""
23,57,7,0,"The mural appears to be fairly old. A knight shields himself and their comrades from an encroaching darkness. The central figure is considerably faded.","",""
24,61,1,10,"I call that “Mushloaf”! The middle is stuffed with bittersweet cactus fruits, so even if the bread dries out, it's still moist inside. Keeps you going in the heat!","",""
25,61,1,10,"That's my “Everburning Bounty,” made with the best parts of the lizard. Cured with special spicy spices! Some find the smell...<Emphasis>challenging</Emphasis>, but it'll warm you up on chilly desert nights!","",""
26,61,1,10,"Oh, you'll like those! “Chewy Skewers”! Find small frogs hiding under rocks, spear with stick, then roast over fire. Crackly on the outside, gooey on the inside─perfect for snacking!","",""
27,61,1,10,"Everyone's favorite! Plump white worms slathered in honey. Once you eat a “Glazed Wriggler,” you'll never want any other treat!","",""
28,57,7,0,"You have located the timeworn tablet!","",""
29,61,1,18,"Were the tablet a fragment of holy scripture, 'twould most assuredly rest here on this altar. Yet this would, I presume, also have been where the Blessed placed the Font of Seeing used in the practice of their faith... Whither, then, would they have set the tablet?","",""
30,57,7,0,"You have located the mysterious person! However, it seems he has likewise spotted you, and hurriedly turns back to the village...","",""
31,57,7,0,"The creature stares at you unflinchingly. This probably isn't the mysterious person Alisaie saw...","",""
32,61,1,15,"Nice shootin'! Keep it up in the actual trial, eh?","",""
33,57,7,0,"The tall, slender towers feature many elaborate windows, the likes of which you have seen nowhere else.","",""
34,57,7,0,"There is a shoebill here. At the bottom of the ocean. For some reason.","",""
35,57,7,0,"The clionid larva floats aimlessly, a forlorn look on its face. It seems harmless enough.","",""
36,61,1,14,"If you're entertaining the thought of knocking off my cowl, know that it will not work.","",""
37,57,7,0,"For all its reaction, the creature may as well be made of stone. It only stares at you unflinchingly, as if peering into your very soul...","",""

39,61,1,22,"Blargh! Wha...what happened?","",""
40,61,1,20,"Hmm... It's a little hard to see from here, but is that a golden pipe connected to the top of those tanks?","And I can see through that window another pipe at the bottom...","Ah! This must be for purifying water drawn up from below!"
41,61,1,20,"Is that water I hear from inside that great big tube?","It must be because of those cogs and that gigantic wheel at the top.","Oh, I see! That's how they draw up the water! There's probably some sort of spiral-shaped mechanism inside it, too."
42,61,1,20,"That looks like the “trees” in Greatest Endsvale!","Hold on, that's a bit of a strange shape... It's thin at the bottom but big and round at the top. Quite tall for something so unbalanced, too.","Now it makes sense! That's where they store the water!"
43,57,7,0,"You spot an ambystoma! An especially lively one, at that.","It would appear that the concept you observed in another time, another place, was approved for life in the wider world...somehow.",""
44,61,1,21,"Ow! That smarts! If this was meant to be a joke, it isn't funny!","",""
45,57,7,0,"You have sedated the wrong bird...","",""
46,61,1,23,"This statue is a representation of Thaliak, one of the Twelve divinities of Eorzea, and guardian deity of Sharlayan. As the god of knowledge, He rules over rivers and wisdom.","There was once a system of governance in Sharlayan known as the Ecclesia─a great gathering at which each citizen was given a voice in decisions affecting the nation's future─and it was during one such forum wherein the people voted to elect Thaliak as our patron.","It was not piety which drove this choice, but rather a natural progression of our principles and creeds. We Sharlayans have, after all, always devoted ourselves to the pursuit of knowledge."
47,61,1,23,"Mythology tells us that Thaliak bore a magicked pitcher, from which poured forth the waters of knowledge.","See how the water is drawn up from the canals and cascades endlessly into the sea? As well as recreating the divine ewer from the tale, it also symbolizes the wisdom which rises from our city and flows out into the world.","If you would like to learn more about the mechanism by which it works, the stonemasons who built it left records of their struggle in the archives of Noumenon. A rather challenging construction, by all accounts."
48,61,1,23,"If you've learned your history, you will know that the Sixth Umbral Era brought a catastrophic flood to the lands of Eorzea. Yet when all seemed lost, the Twelve Archons rose up and saved multitudes from a terrible fate.","Of those twelve, it was Archon Nyunkrepf who brought our ancestors here in his ark, and together they founded what was to become the great nation of Sharlayan.","The beach at the foot of Thaliak's statue is the very spot where those first Sharlayans made land. I imagine how they must have felt on that day, some sixteen hundred years ago..."

54,57,7,0,"That's no Omicron─it's an ambystoma! An especially lively one, at that.","Perhaps it snuck aboard the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis>, but however it came to be here, it seems to be completely in its element...",""

58,57,7,0,"The exquisite buckles of the stylish footwear are a design unique to House Manderville. These shoes would almost certainly fetch a small fortune in the markets.","",""

62,57,7,0,"Nashu is romping around with Argos, already forgetting why she was out here...","",""
63,57,7,0,"Delion is searching high and low for any sign of alien vessels. Like a true professional.","",""
64,61,1,25,"Oh dear, one of the bird's eyes seems to be missing a gemstone.","",""

66,61,1,24,"These tail feathers have seen better days. I swear the colors were a lot brighter the last time I saw them.","",""
67,61,1,24,"He must be boiling sitting so close to the furnace, and there's no airflow to speak of. How could anyone work in that stifling heat?","",""
68,61,1,24,"Those tools are looking pretty worn down. Maybe it's time for some new ones...?","",""
69,61,1,24,"He's barely touched his meal! That dish is meant to be eaten hot, or it loses its savor...","",""
70,57,7,0,"The general shape of this weapon resembles a gun, but its construction suggests it's far more advanced than anything you've seen before.","",""
71,57,7,0,"In place of where eyes or a mouth might be, you see a strange sigil on the front of this helm.","",""
72,57,7,0,"From a distance it appeared to be simple armor, but upon closer inspection its construction is quite intricate.","The material from which it is made is unclear, and you see no signs of a power source.",""
