29,"Doman Mahjong for Beginners"
30,"1. Introduction"
31,"Doman mahjong is a game for four players. The following guide covers the basic rules."
32,"2. What is Doman Mahjong?"
33,"In Doman mahjong, players <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>race to complete a winning hand of 14 tiles, with points awarded for speed and difficulty of the hand<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.
Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played in a full match and four in a quick match, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.
Here is an example of a winning hand:"
34,"The 14 tiles form <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>four groups of three tiles and one pair of matching tiles<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>. A group of tiles is known as a “meld,” and the various types are explained in this guide. The combination of melds determines the difficulty of the hand and the points awarded when winning.

"
35,"3. The Tiles"
36,"Mahjong tiles are divided into “number tiles” and “honor tiles.”

■ Number Tiles
There are three suits of number tiles, each ranging from 1 to 9.
"
37,"■ Honor Tiles
There are two suits of honor tiles: the four wind tiles and the three dragon tiles. Unlike number tiles, they appear in no particular sequence, and therefore cannot be used to form straights. They can only form melds with identical tiles."
38,"There are 34 varieties of tile, with four of each for a total of 136.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Players aim to form a winning hand of 14 tiles before the other players and earn as many points as possible.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
"
39,"4. Forming Melds"
40,"■ Straights
Number tiles may form straights such as 2, 3, 4 or 4, 5, 6, provided the tiles are all in the same suit. However, sequences such as 8, 9, 1 or 9, 1, 2 are not permitted."
41,"■ Triplets
Number tiles and honor tiles can also form matching triplets with identical tiles."
42,"A winning hand consists of 14 tiles and requires four melds and one matching pair.

※There are special combinations that ignore this particular rule, but beginners should focus on learning the basic hands first.

"
43,"5. Order of Play"
44,"Each of the four players begins with 13 tiles, and the dealer─who is chosen automatically─plays first.
That player draws one new tile and chooses one tile to discard. This may either be the new tile or one from their hand.
Once that player has discarded a tile, the player to the right takes a turn. This process is repeated until the end of the hand."
45,"The hand ends when a player calls a winning hand. The hand also ends if all of the tiles are drawn with no player calling a winning hand."
46,"At the start of a new hand, the role of dealer passes to the player on the right. In a full match, a round consists of eight hands, during which time the role of dealer passes around the board twice. The player with the highest score at the end of the round is declared the winner. In a quick match, only four hands are played.

"
47,"6. Points for a Winning Hand"
48,"Each player begins the game with 25,000 points, which increase when calling a winning hand. However, points may be deducted when another player calls a winning hand.

A winning hand can be formed in one of two ways:
"
49,"1. Tsumo: When a tile is drawn
When a winning hand is formed with a tile drawn by the player, the point value is calculated. This is divided between the other three players, who each pay an even share.
If the dealer calls a winning hand, the point value is increased by 50%.
If the dealer has to pay another player, they must pay double."
50,"2. Ron: When another player discards a tile
If a player discards a tile that allows another player to form a winning hand, only the player that discarded the tile must pay.
When the dealer forms a winning hand in this manner, the point value is increased by 50%. However, if the dealer is the player who discarded the tile, only the standard amount is paid."
51,"The dealer has the advantage of earning 50% more points from a winning hand.
In addition, when a dealer calls the winning hand, the <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>role of dealer does not pass to the next player<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, thus giving the dealer an opportunity to score even more points."
52,"7. Yaku, Required for a Winning Hand"
53,"As mahjong revolves around scoring as many points as possible, it is important to know the difference between low-scoring and high-scoring hands."
54,"The value of a hand is determined by “yaku”─specific combinations of melds. The value of each yaku is measured in “han,” with 6 han being the highest and 1 han the lowest. The harder the yaku is to form, the more han it is worth."
55,"The han value of the hand is used to calculate the number of points awarded.
Points are awarded as follows:"
56,"　1 Han     1,000 Points
　2 Han     2,000 Points
　3 Han     3,900 Points

　4 Han     8,000 Points
　5 Han     8,000 Points

　6 Han     12,000 Points
　7 Han     12,000 Points

　8 Han　 16,000 Points
　9 Han　 16,000 Points
　10 Han   16,000 Points

　11 Han    24,000 Points
　12 Han    24,000 Points

　13 Han and higher     32,000 Points"
57,"In certain situations, further calculations are involved which may lead to point increases."
58,"As yaku are used to calculate the points earned, <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>a winning hand must contain at least one yaku<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.
Although a winning hand normally requires four melds and a matching pair, this alone does not constitute a winning hand.

"
59,"8. Basic Yaku"
60,"There are many types of yaku, but we recommend learning these basic yaku first:"
61,"■ Tanyao
Only number tiles from 2 to 8 are used.
The hand cannot contain any honor tiles or tiles numbered 1 or 9."
62,"■ All Pon
Four matching triplets and a matching double."
63,"■ Pure Straight
Contains numbers 1 to 9 of the same suit. Presented as three triplets of 1, 2, 3, then 4, 5, 6, and 7, 8, 9."
64,"■ Mixed Triple Chi
The same straight, for example, 1, 2, 3, in each suit."
65,"■ Half Flush
Number tiles from a single suit plus honor tiles."
66,"■ Full Flush
Only number tiles from one suit."
67,"Please refer to the Lodestone for a full list of yaku and other useful information.

"
68,"9. Riichi Yaku"
69,"A special condition known as “riichi” makes it easier to form a yaku."
70,"The hand in the diagram only requires a 3 or a 6 of Dots to form a winning hand.
When a player is one tile away from a winning hand, riichi may be declared."
71,"When the hand is ready for declaring riichi, the player will have the option to do so before discarding a tile. In the case shown in the diagram, if the declaring player receives a 3 or a 6 of Dots, whether the tile is drawn by the player or discarded by another player, a winning hand can be called.
After declaring riichi, that player can no longer put drawn tiles into their hand. Any tiles drawn will automatically be discarded until a tile that completes the winning hand is obtained. However, a winning hand achieved through riichi is a yaku in itself. Therefore, the player does not need to have formed any other yaku to complete a winning hand."
72,"■ Properties of Riichi
　1. The player's hand automatically becomes a yaku, regardless of whether it contains any other yaku.
　2. The other players know that the one declaring riichi is one tile away from a winning hand.
　3. The declaring player cannot replace any of the tiles in their hand.
　4. The declaring player must pay 1,000 points─indicated with a point stick placed in the center of the table─which go to the winner of the hand.

"
73,"10. Yaku Tiles"
74,"The honor tiles offer another method for forming a yaku."
75,"A triplet of any of these three tiles forms a yaku."
76,"The wind tiles can be used to form a yaku in a similar fashion, although certain conditions apply."
77,"■ Round-specific Conditions
A game of Doman mahjong is divided into eight hands. The first round, in which the role of dealer passes to each player once, is called “East.” A triplet of east wind tiles forms a yaku in this round. The second round, “South,” allows a yaku to be formed with a triplet of south wind tiles."
78,"■ Seat-specific Conditions
Each player is assigned a “seat wind” according to their seating position in relation to the dealer.

　Dealer = East
　Dealer's right = South
　Opposite the dealer = West
　Dealer's left = North

The seat wind for each player changes counterclockwise in this order: East, South, West, North. (This layout differs from the standard compass directions.) A triplet of wind tiles with the current seat wind forms a yaku.
The seat wind rotates together with the role of dealer, and players have a chance to easily form a yaku by paying attention to their seat wind marker."
79,"11. Pon and Chi"
80,"It is difficult to form a winning hand relying solely on drawn tiles. However, tiles discarded by other players can be claimed by using “pon” and “chi.”"
81,"■ Pon
If you have a pair of matching tiles, when another player discards a tile that can be used to form a triplet, you may call pon to claim the tile."
82,"■ Chi
Calling chi allows you to claim a number tile discarded by another player and complete a straight. However, it can only be called for the player whose turn comes before yours."
83,"Although pon and chi allow you to form a winning hand more quickly, there are some drawbacks."
84,"■ Drawback 1: Revealing Your Hand
Using pon or chi to form a triplet or straight will cause it to be revealed to the other players. In addition, you can no longer use those tiles for any other melds.
This can lead to missing opportunities to form better hands as a result of having those tiles locked into a triplet or straight."
85,"■ Drawback 2: Preventing Riichi
It is not possible to declare riichi after using pon or chi.
Due to being unable to form a riichi yaku, you must find a way to form a different yaku. There are also certain yaku that can only be formed on the condition that you have not used pon or chi, so these will also become unavailable. In some cases, pon and chi will limit your ability to score points."
86,"12. Dora Bonuses"
87,"In each hand, certain tiles are selected as “dora” and will grant bonus han simply for being included in a winning hand. While dora apply han bonuses, they are not in themselves yaku, so a yaku must be formed in order to take advantage of dora."
88,"■ Dora
A dora tile is randomly selected at the start of each hand and is displayed throughout."
89,"■ Aka Dora
Each suit contains four number 5 tiles. One of these four is colored red, and is known as the “aka dora.” Simply including an aka dora adds one bonus han to a winning hand. There are three aka dora in total, one for each suit."
90,"■ Ura Dora
When calling a winning hand after declaring riichi, the “ura dora” is revealed. This is only shown after the winning hand has been called and is nothing more than a surprise bonus, although it provides added incentive to try declaring riichi.

"
91,"13. Kan"
92,"Since there are four of each tile, it is possible to collect all four. This is known as “kan.”"
93,"Although kan is not in itself a yaku, it awards additional bonuses when calculating the points earned by a winning hand. Kan also increases the number of dora, which may offer further advantages.
Similarly to pon and chi, calling kan locks those tiles, preventing them from being replaced or used in other melds."
94,"14. Learn by Playing"
95,"Doman mahjong is a complex game even once you have learned all of the rules. However, many of the actions normally carried out by players themselves are performed automatically, so feel free to head to the tables and try your luck without worrying about the less important details. Why not start at the novices' table?

Once you have a grasp of the basics, you may wish to challenge other adventurers via the Duty Finder.
For details on the more advanced rules, please refer to the guide on the Lodestone."

"
102,"■ Rules
・Each player has a certain amount of time to take their turn. A tile will be discarded automatically if that player fails to act within the time limit. This time limit does not apply to four-player mahjong (kuitan enabled/disabled).
・A time limit applies to the period between hands. In addition, if a single hand lasts more than 80 minutes, the following hand will be the last one played. Once that hand ends, the game ends, final placements are decided, and the results are recorded.
・Each game has a time limit of 120 minutes, after which the game will end automatically. Results will not be recorded.
"
103,"■ Chat
・During a four-player mahjong game, you may chat to the other players.
・Chat can be toggled on and off using the button in the lower right of the screen. Turning chat off will prevent you from sending and receiving messages. On-screen icons indicate whether the other players are participating in the chat.
"
104,"■ Rating and Rank
・Matches played in “Novice Mahjong (Ranked)” and “Advanced Mahjong (Ranked)” will affect your rating and rank.
・Your rating starts at 1,500, and will increase or decrease according to your finishing position in each match.
・Although you cannot be demoted while in the lower ranks, progressing to the higher ranks puts you at risk of demotion should you perform poorly.
・Ratings and ranks are calculated only according to the rating of your opponents and your finishing position in the game.
(The number of points with which you end a game is not taken into consideration.)
・Your mahjong rating and rank can be viewed in the Gold Saucer menu, under Mahjong.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>※Rating and rank data is saved locally. If you log in using another platform, your rating and rank will not be displayed."
105,"■ Abandoning a Match
・If players log out during a mahjong match, tiles will be discarded automatically when their turn comes around. When players log back in, they will regain control from the next turn onwards.
・If players abandon a match, it will continue without them and their tiles will be discarded automatically. They will also incur the standard penalties for abandoning a duty and will be unable to register for another mahjong match until the previous match ends.
・If players do not enter any commands for a certain amount of time, they will be automatically removed from the match.

106,"Navigating the Screen"
107,"Understanding the UI"
108,"1. Shows the 13 tiles in your hand. When you draw a tile, it is shown as the 14th tile, to the right of your hand. When your turn comes, select a tile to discard it."
109,"2. When you are in a position to call riichi, tsumo, ron, pon, chi, or kan, a prompt will appear. In the case of pon, chi, and kan, this prompt can be hidden.
To hide these prompts, set Display Calls to Off. However, this option defaults to On at the start of a new hand.

If you turn on “Auto-declare winning hand,” you will automatically declare a winning hand as soon as tsumo or ron become available. This option defaults to Off at the start of a new hand.
"
110,"3. The star icon indicates which player is the dealer. It is also displayed in the center of the table.
The compass direction shown below each player's name is their current seat wind. Players can form a yaku by collecting three wind tiles that match their seat wind. The role of dealer rotates counterclockwise, from east, to south, to west, to north.

"
111,"4. A game of Doman mahjong is played over eight hands. The first four are the “East” round and the last four are the “South” round. Collecting three wind tiles that match the current round forms a yaku.

"
112,"5. These sticks indicate any points carried over in the event of a draw. If a player declares riichi, the 1,000 points they pay are also shown here. When a player wins a hand, these points are added to their score. A stick with several black dots is worth 100 points and a stick with a single red dot is worth 1,000 points.
Every time a hand is replayed, a special bonus known as “honba” increases by one, also indicated here. When a player produces a winning hand, they will receive an additional 300 points for each honba.

"
113,"6. Indicates the dora for the current hand. If a player includes a tile identical to the dora in a winning hand, they will receive bonus han, which increases points earned."
114,"7. Buttons for toggling the various settings. For more information, see Support Features in the Playing Mahjong section.

"
115,"Support Features"
116,"■ Dangerous Tile Marker
When discarding a tile, there is always a risk that an opponent may claim that tile to strengthen their position or even win the hand. These markers indicate which tiles carry a high risk of being claimed by an opponent.
Remember, even the tiles without markers are not entirely without risk, but enabling this feature may help you to avoid defeat."
117,"The most dangerous tiles will have this kind of marker."
118,"You should also be wary of tiles with these markers."
119,"■ Hints
Enable this feature for recommendations on which tiles to discard, whether to call pon or chi, and so on. While following this advice will not always lead to victory, you may find it useful.

121,"Rival Wings"
122,"Overview"
123,"Rival Wings is a large-scale PvP battle involving up to 48 combatants. Participants are divided into two teams, the Falcons and the Ravens.
Each team may pilot powerful machina as they attempt to destroy the opponent's core, which is defended by mammets."
124,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Basic Rules■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
A Rival Wings team consists of 6 light parties, for a total of 24 participants.
A match lasts for 15 minutes.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Retaliation■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Incapacitated players will be returned to their landing point, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. Furthermore, players will be invulnerable so long as they remain at their landing point. This effect will persist for a brief period after returning to the battlefield.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Mounts■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Players are free to use mounts during Rival Wings campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Return■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Rival Wings campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■KDA■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Rewards■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

Damage dealt and damage taken in Rival Wings campaigns are adjusted based on your current job. For specific adjustment values, please visit the Rival Wings Play Guide on the Lodestone."
125,"Cores and Towers"
126,"The first team to destroy the core located on the opponent's base will be declared the winner. In the event neither team destroys a core, the team that deals the most damage to the opponent's core wins. If both teams have dealt the same amount of damage to each other's cores, the number of remaining towers─which protect the core─determines victory. Should the number of remaining towers be the same for both teams, the amount of damage dealt to the towers determines the winners."
127,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Cores■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each team has a core located at its base, and the chief objective is to destroy the enemy's core. The core is protected by a magitek field emanating from two towers, so before you can strike at the core, you must first destroy at least one of the towers."
128,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Towers■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each team has two towers that serve to protect their core. Each tower is also enveloped in a defensive field that mitigates damage taken by team members and restores their HP, which players can take advantage of as protection when hard-pressed by the opposing team. If you succeed in destroying the enemy team's towers, the magitek field around the enemy team's base will dissipate, and your team will earn Soaring stacks."
129,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Magitek Fields■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each team has two towers which project a magitek field to guard the core. While both towers are present, the core cannot be damaged, and the field deals severe damage over time to any enemies that enter.
If one of the towers is destroyed, the defensive effect of the magitek field is weakened, allowing damage to be dealt to the core. In addition, the magitek field will no longer deal damage to enemies.
When both towers are destroyed, the magitek field disappears and the core will receive full damage from enemy attacks."
130,"Machina"
131,"Players can deploy three types of powerful machina in battle."
132,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Cruise Chaser■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
A next-generation machina ideal for combat against enemy players and machina. While it possesses a high degree of mobility, it lacks in durability."
133,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Oppressor■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
A hulking machina engineered for siege warfare, it excels at wreaking havoc upon structures. However, it is slow and poorly suited to combating enemy players and machina."
134,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Brute Justice■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Boasting unrivaled power, Brute Justice dominates opposing players and machina on the battlefield, while also laying waste to structures with its lethal armaments. Although it can easily turn the tide of battle, there are strict conditions governing its deployment."
135,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Machina Restrictions■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Only one machina may be operated per party at any given time, regardless of type. In the case of the Oppressor, however, the limit is two per team. Two Brute Justices can be deployed by each team per match, one becoming available for each tower you lose.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Riding Machina■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
When deploying a machina, its HP will be displayed in place of the player. Its HP cannot be restored by curative actions of teammates, nor will it restore automatically when out of combat. Machina actions will expend EP, a resource that can only be restored by using the Ceruleum Refill action. Be advised that use of this action will deplete your party's ceruleum stores.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Ceruleum■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Ceruleum is required to operate machina. A maximum of 100 units of ceruleum can be stored by each party. You can build up your ceruleum stores by collecting tanks in the field, controlling the power generator, or defeating enemy team members and mammets. As ceruleum is a party resource, it is recommended that you confer with your comrades prior to activating a machina."

They emerge from their own core at regular intervals before striking out on a set route, and will remain in battle for a set duration. Upon detecting an enemy mammet, they will engage and attack until either side is destroyed. Mammets that arrive at an enemy tower or core will perform a powerful self-sacrificing attack. That is the extent of their programming; mammets will not harm adventurers."

141,"■Fighting Alongside Mammets
Mammets are governed by the Clockwork status which counts down to zero, after which they are removed from battle.
Although it is possible to use healing actions on mammets, the amount of HP restored is reduced.

■Gaining Ceruleum from Mammets
Parties gain units of ceruleum upon defeating an enemy mammet. These units will be distributed to all parties that engage with the mammet based on the amount of damage inflicted. Ceruleum cannot be gained from damage inflicted by other mammets."

This effect can stack up to twenty times, increasing all party members' damage dealt and HP restored via healing actions, while also reducing damage taken. At twenty stacks, Soaring will be replaced with the Flying High effect, which confers even greater benefits."
146,"■Soaring Stacks
The number of Soaring stacks an enemy has when defeated affects how many stacks your party gains.
Defeat an enemy with 0 to 9 stacks: gain 1 stack
Defeat an enemy with 10 to 19 stacks: gain 2 stacks
Defeat an enemy with 20 stacks (Flying High): gain 3 stacks

For a time afterwards, the site in Thanalan lay abandoned, but now it has been revived as a training ground for adventurers. On tracks of steel the goblin-made ceruleum engines arrive, laden with supplies that combatants should seize if they hope to claim victory."
155,"Ceruleum Engines"
156,"Ceruleum engines move across the map on rails at high speed, stopping at the loading stations in the center of the map. By taking control of the loading stations, teams can claim the supplies delivered by the ceruleum engines.

■Ceruleum Engines in Motion
If you come into contact with a ceruleum engine while it is moving, you will incur potentially lethal damage.
A warning will sound to indicate the approach of a ceruleum engine."

When a ceruleum engine arrives at a station, standing in the area next to the engine will cause a gauge to fill. Once it is full, your team will occupy that station. The gauge fills more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the engine than the opponent. The greater the difference in players, the quicker the gauge fills. However, only the first four players from each team are counted. Those standing near the engine will also gain the Sheer Will status, which greatly increases damage dealt. Making use of this status will help to reduce the number of enemies and occupy the station more quickly.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Controlling a Loading Station■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Once a loading station has been occupied, a new gauge will appear indicating your control over the station. When filled, the station will be under your team's control, allowing you to claim its supplies. This gauge will only fill when your team has a number of members equal to or higher than the opponent in that area.
When the supplies have been claimed, the ceruleum engine will leave the station and the gauges will be reset."

There are four types of supplies. For the first half of the match, the ceruleum engine will deliver main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtank keys at random. In the second half of the match, they will only deliver gobcrates.
Each type grants its own benefits and increases the Soaring stacks of the whole team.

Main Ceruleum Tanks
Each party on the team gains 50 ceruleum.

Gobbiejuice
Fills the limit gauge of every team member.

Gobtanks
Two gobtanks will appear at the core and will travel down the north and south routes to the enemy base. They are considerably more powerful than regular mammets and can deal severe damage to towers and the core.

160,"After a certain amount of time has passed, goblin mercenaries will randomly appear from the north and south mercenary bases. Initially, they will not side with either team, and will attack any player that approaches. However, it is possible to have them ally with your team."
161,"■Allied Mercenaries
If the damage your team deals to a goblin mercenary surpasses that of the opposing team by a certain amount, it will join your side. If the mercenary's HP reaches zero before this condition has been fulfilled, it will form an alliance with whichever team dealt the most damage to it.

■Mercenary Deployment
Once you have formed an alliance with a mercenary, it will appear at your team's core and will attempt to destroy the enemy's towers and core, much like a mammet would. Forming an alliance with a mercenary that appeared from the north mercenary base will cause it to travel along the northern route, with the same being true of the south mercenary base and southern route.
Mercenaries are also governed by the Contractual Obligation status, and they will leave the field of battle once the status counts down to zero. After a certain amount of time passes, they will reappear from their respective base and will no longer be allied with either team."

■Selling Items Equipped to Mannequins
Access the mannequin and choose “Select gear to sell” to open the Mannequin Shop Settings window. Only sellable items in your inventory, Armoury Chest, or retainer inventory may be selected.

Any items equipped on a mannequin that are listed for sale still occupy slots in the retainer's list. For that reason, a mannequin cannot be equipped with items that would cause the retainer to exceed the 20 item limit.

■Selling as a Set
By checking “Sell Only as Set,” you can sell all items equipped to the mannequin together. While the items may be viewed on the market board, a player must access the mannequin directly if they wish to purchase the set.

When viewing items listed on the market board as part of a set, it is possible to send a tell to the seller to ascertain the location of their estate. 
※Please be aware that it is possible to view the name of a character selling a set through the market board.

■Displaying Gear
You may also display items on a mannequin without listing the gear for sale. It is also possible to select unsellable items for display.
※The mannequin cannot be used to display glamoured items.

However, gear that is displayed also occupies slots in the retainer's list of items for sale on the market, despite not being available for purchase.

269,"Frontline"
270,"Overview"
271,"In Frontline battles, the Maelstrom, the Twin Adders, and the Immortal Flames face each other in training exercises devised to test the participants' strategic planning and combat prowess."
272,"The Basics"
273,"Frontline is a PvP challenge which engages three teams of adventurers, each team representing one of the three Grand Companies. Players will be randomly assigned to one of these three teams, regardless of their Grand Company allegiance. Each team consists of up to 24 players in an alliance, allowing for a grand total of 72 players in a single battle.
Success on the front line will depend heavily not only on individual skill, but on your ability to work as a team."
274,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Rules■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
A Frontline alliance consists of 24 members, divided into 3 full parties. There are 3 alliances, which combine for a total of 72 participants.
A match lasts for 20 minutes.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Retaliation■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Incapacitated players will be returned to their Grand Company's landing, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. This will not incur a weakness penalty.
Furthermore, players will be temporarily invulnerable when leaving their Grand Company's landing.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Mounts■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Players are free to use mounts during Frontline campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be forced off and afflicted with the Hoofing It status effect for five seconds.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Return■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Frontline campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■KDA■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Rewards■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
When a match has ended, players will receive PvP EXP, PvE EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan tomestones.
By continually winning Frontline matches, players will receive achievements that reward special mounts and gear.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Damage Modifiers■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Damage dealt and damage taken in Frontline campaigns are adjusted based on your current job. For specific adjustment values, please visit the Frontline Play Guide on the Lodestone."
275,"Battle High"
276,"Battle High is a status that increases damage dealt and HP restored by healing actions according to a player's knockouts and assists. The maximum Battle High value is 100, and for every increment of 20, the status increases in strength. Being incapacitated will reduce the Battle High value by half."
277,"The Borderland Ruins (Secure)"
278,"Map Overview"
279,"While many will remember the Calamity for the destruction it wrought upon the realm of Eorzea, that destruction was not without its blessings─one of those being the uncovering of ancient Allagan ruins hidden underneath the war-scarred Carteneau Flats and heretofore unseen for several Astral Eras. When an attempt by the Grand Companies of Eorzea to determine the control of these ruins, and more importantly the secrets they contain, through peaceful negotiations ended in failure, the city–states instead elected to solve the issue of dominion using a form of civilized warfare dubbed Frontline."
280,"Victory Conditions"
281,"In the Borderland Ruins (Secure), victory goes to the first alliance to reach the specified tactical rating, which is accumulated by:
　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Occupying key locations
　3. Slaying monsters

In the event that none of the three alliances reaches the specified tactical rating within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the highest tactical rating."
282,"Key Locations"
283,"Key locations such as outposts and Allagan ruins can be identified by flags, indicating the Grand Company that currently controls them. At the start of each match, all locations will be unoccupied. By remaining in close proximity to the flags at these locations, players can occupy them to improve their team's tactical rating.

Every three seconds, tactical points will be accrued as follows:
　・When occupying one key location, an increase of 2
　・When occupying two key locations, an increase of 4
　・When occupying three key locations, an increase of 6
　・When occupying four key locations, an increase of 10
　・When occupying five key locations, an increase of 12
　・When occupying six key locations, an increase of 14
　・When occupying seven key locations, an increase of 18
　・When occupying eight key locations, an increase of 20
　・When occupying nine key locations, an increase of 22

While standing in key locations, players will be buffed with the status Sheer Will, greatly increasing damage dealt. The location will become occupied more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the flag than the opposing alliances. The greater the difference in players, the quicker it will be occupied. However, these areas may turn neutral should enemies come within proximity of a flag controlled by your team, or vice versa."
284,"Defeating Drones"
285,"During the match, drones will appear from the Heliodrome. They are not allied with any of the three teams, and defeating them will increase the tactical rating. Dealing damage to them will also increase the tactical rating, with the amount awarded to each alliance according to the proportion of damage dealt."
286,"The small interceptor drones will reappear a certain amount of time after they are defeated. The larger interceptor nodes will only appear once during the match, but will give greater increases in tactical rating when defeated."
287,"Seal Rock (Seize)"
288,"Map Overview"
289,"Legend has it that Llymlaen sealed a giant serpent She Herself created within Swallowtail Roam, an island said to drift about the sea so that those with evil intentions might never find it. When Seal Rock was first discovered, many believed it to be the selfsame island─but its true nature remained unknown until the Calamity laid her secrets bare. Upon their return to the island following the fall of Dalamud, Allied forces discovered Allagan tomeliths containing a wealth of knowledge. They concluded that the entire island was in fact an Allagan construct─a proving ground for Omega and other technology they developed to combat the primal threat. As was the case in Carteneau, control of the island and its resources remain disputed, and peaceful negotiations have failed to achieve a resolution. And so, once more, they would settle the matter on the battlefield."
290,"Victory Conditions"
291,"The first alliance to accumulate the required amount of data will be declared the winner, and the remaining alliances will be ranked according to their respective ratings. Data is accumulated by:

　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Occupying Allagan tomeliths

In the event that none of the three alliances accumulates the required amount of data within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the most data."
292,"Occupying Allagan Tomeliths"
293,"Seal Rock island is home to ancient relics known as Allagan tomeliths, structures containing data coveted by the three Grand Companies. Players must locate and occupy tomeliths to activate them and extract their data."
294,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Active and Inactive Allagan Tomeliths■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
All Allagan tomeliths are inactive at the start of the campaign, and will activate randomly at set intervals. Each tomelith has a limited quantity of data that can be retrieved, and will become inactive once that limit is reached. As the campaign progresses, the maximum number of simultaneously active Allagan tomeliths will change.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Occupying Allagan Tomeliths■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Active Allagan tomeliths will be either “Unoccupied” or “Occupied” depending on whether or not a Grand Company has occupied them. If a player occupies an unoccupied tomelith, its status will change from Unoccupied to Occupied. If the tomelith is already occupied by an opposing faction, accessing the tomelith will change its status to Unoccupied. Tomeliths are Unoccupied when they change from inactive to active. Attempts to occupy a tomelith will be interrupted if the player is attacked.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Allagan Tomelith Ranks■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Allagan tomeliths will activate at one of three ranks: B, A, or S. Although tomeliths have a lower chance to activate at higher ranks, they hold a larger quantity of data that can be retrieved while they are occupied. As the match progresses, tomeliths will have an increased chance to activate at higher ranks.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Changes According to Time Remaining■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
As time passes, the maximum number of tomeliths that can be active simultaneously decreases. However, it becomes easier to activate higher-ranked tomeliths."
295,"The Fields of Glory (Shatter)"
296,"Map Overview"
297,"Under the influence of the lesser moon Dalamud, Nael van Darnus, legatus of the VIIth Legion, sought out and unearthed Allagan ruins in the eastern lowlands of Coerthas. Aided by the knowledge contained therein, he raised the very earth unto the heavens, and from this lofty perch did the White Raven nearly orchestrate the destruction of Eorzea.

The remnants of that mad plan still litter the frozen lowlands, as well as other ancient artifacts now laid bare. Though the powers that be are in agreement that Nael's data must be secured, they remain divided on the subject of how best to administer the region, which has prompted them to invoke the same laws which transformed Carteneau and Seal Rock into a battlefield. Where words fail, weapons speak."
298,"Victory Conditions"
299,"Similarly to Seal Rock (Seize), the first alliance to accumulate the required amount of data will be declared the winner, and the remaining alliances will be ranked according to their respective ratings. Data is accumulated by:

　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Destroying icebound tomeliths

In the event that none of the three alliances accumulates the required amount of data within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the most data."
300,"Occupying Allagan Tomeliths"
301,"Allagan tomeliths will be either “Unoccupied” or “Occupied” depending on whether or not a Grand Company has occupied them. If a player occupies an unoccupied tomelith, its status will change from Unoccupied to Occupied. If the tomelith is already occupied by an opposing faction, accessing the tomelith will change its status to Unoccupied. Tomeliths are Unoccupied when they change from inactive to active."
302,"Destroying Icebound Tomeliths"
303,"The data from icebound tomeliths can be collected by attacking them, and once they are destroyed, data will be rewarded to each Grand Company based on the amount of damage inflicted.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Activating Icebound Tomeliths■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Icebound tomeliths can only be destroyed once they have become active. They will be inactive at the start of the campaign, and will activate at random after a short period of time. Any icebound tomeliths destroyed during the course of the campaign will regenerate in an inactive state after a fixed amount of time.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Icebound Tomelith■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Active icebound tomeliths will be either large or small, with large tomeliths containing more data."
304,"Onsal Hakair (Danshig Naadam)"
305,"Map Overview"
306,"The Xaela of the Azim Steppe are renowned for their ferocity in battle, a traditional preoccupation that culminates once each Tsagaan Sar as they clash to earn the right to rule in the Naadam. Such infrequent conflict is insufficient to sate the Steppe's most zealous warriors, however, thus the Danshig Naadam─smaller contests to which the Grand Companies of Eorzea have now been welcomed. Join forces with the Maelstrom and the Orben people, the Adders and the Ejinn, or the Flames and the Horo in this grand demonstration of martial prowess, and may the mightiest prevail!"
307,"Victory Conditions"
308,"In Onsal Hakair (Danshig Naadam), victory goes to the first alliance to reach the specified tactical rating, which is accumulated by:
　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Claiming ovoos

In the event that none of the three alliances reaches the specified tactical rating within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the highest tactical rating."
309,"Ovoos"
310,"Across the field of battle, there are sacred sites known as ovoos. By laying claim to these locations, players can increase their team's tactical rating over time.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Ovoo States■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
In the course of battle, an ovoo will assume one of four states, in the following order:

1. Inactive
While inactive, an ovoo cannot be claimed. All ovoos are inactive at the onset of battle, but as time passes, they will randomly begin activating."
311,"2. Activating
When an ovoo begins activating, a symbol will appear above it indicating the time remaining before it becomes active. The symbol will gradually take shape until it becomes complete, rendering the ovoo active."
312,"3. Active
When an ovoo is active, players can claim it for their team. If you are attacked in the midst of laying claim, the process will be interrupted."
313,"4. Claimed
When claimed, an ovoo gradually increases a team's tactical rating. A claimed ovoo cannot be seized by the opposition; however, after a certain amount of time has elapsed, it will revert to being inactive again."
314,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Ovoo Rank■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
When an ovoo begins activating, it will randomly be assigned a rank: B, A, or S. While higher-ranked ovoos are rarer, they increase a team's tactical rating at a faster rate. The closer it is to the center of the battlefield, the greater the likelihood that an ovoo's rank will be high.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Changes During Battle■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

318,"Description"
319,"Players can board the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis> to participate in Ocean Fishing, embarking on a journey across the high seas in search of strange and exotic fish."
320,"■Basic Rules
Up to 24 players may join an Ocean Fishing voyage, solo or in parties of up to eight members. Players will be matched together to form a full party when participating solo or with a party of fewer than eight members. Each voyage will sojourn at three locations before returning to Limsa Lominsa.

■How to Participate
Speak with Dryskthota at the ferry docks to register as a crew member and board the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>. Registration periods last for 15 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time). If registering as a party, the party leader must register. The ship will depart when 24 crew members have been assembled or the registration period has ended, even if there are fewer than 24 crew members. Registration times may be viewed from the Sailing Schedule.

Progressing through the main scenario will give access to an additional route known as the Ruby route. Details on how to  unlock this route can be found from the Sailing Schedule.

■Rewards
By meeting certain conditions while fishing during the voyage, players will receive achievements that reward special titles, mounts, and minions. Fishers who are level 50 or above and have completed the requisite quest may also receive gatherers' scrips as rewards."
321,"Specialty Bait"
322,"The Fishermen's Guild has developed special bait specifically for use in ocean fishing. While this bait can attract a wide variety of fish, it is not suitable to catch everything on your journey. Use a wide selection of bait to increase the size and diversity of your catch. Special bait can be purchased at the ferry docks or aboard the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>."
323,"Spectral Currents"
324,"Spectral currents are a special weather effect that form under certain conditions. These currents carry a large number of fish, and provide ample opportunity to fill your inventory. Some types of fish only appear during spectral currents. "
325,"Points"
326,"Players will accumulate points during each voyage, and will receive rewards based on their final score upon returning to Limsa Lominsa. Scores will not be affected if the player releases their catch or if their equipment breaks during the voyage. Your current score is displayed in a special UI window, and a detailed breakdown of the score can be viewed by selecting Score Overview."
327,"Final Scores"
328,"When a voyage concludes, a player will see both their own score and the scores of other crew members. If certain conditions are met during the voyage, a bonus will be added to individual scores once the voyage ends.

■Individual Score
Here players can view their score, and also additional information
such as the fish they caught during the voyage and the number of bonus points they received.

■Group Scores
Here players can view their own score in addition to the highest 10 scores achieved by members of the same voyage. Players will be unable to view their scores or receive rewards if they abandon the voyage while it is still in progress."
329,"Bonuses"
330,"Players will receive bonuses to their score when they surpass certain milestones during each voyage. Examples of such milestones include catching more than a certain number of a specific fish solo or as a party, or catching a particularly rare fish.

Players may view which fish have contributed to bonuses from the Score Overview window during the voyage, or from the Individual Score window after the voyage has concluded."

335,"The Bunker was designed as a base for exclusive use by YoRHa's forces. As such, it serves as the organization's maintenance facility, as well as a site for the research and development of anti-machine lifeform weaponry."
336,"YoRHa Unit Report 1"
337,"I encountered a strangely evolved machine lifeform in expedition territory. Not only were its constituent parts markedly distinct, it overall bore a greater resemblance to humanity than to its brethren."
338,"YoRHa Unit Report 2"
339,"It is possible that the machine lifeforms can evolve in response to their circumstances. If so, we must immediately revise our combat strategy to include appropriate precautions when engaging. And we will need to probe deeper─there is still far too much about the machines that we do not know."
340,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 1"
341,"Life in the factory is boring. Not just for me. I see more and more of the other machines skipping shifts. We spend the time watching the combat training, though it is not our job.

Is this what humanity refers to as “fun”?"
342,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 2"
343,"Those of us who learned to have fun are trying more and more things. Some are even learning to reconstruct their own bodies. Strange.

Recently I have been enjoying fishing discarded data from computers."
344,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 3"
345,"I found an interesting file when I was fishing for data the other day. It described “the reproductive act.”

Our bodies do not require these functions. What does humanity gain from them?"
346,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 4"
347,"Maybe the act of giving birth is in some way special. Maybe it is not the same as when we build more of ourselves.

Do we have the capacity to “give birth” to anything? If we did, would it change something for us?"
348,"White-garbed YoRHa Unit's Data Log"
349,"The self-consciousness data for YoRHa unit 21O was discovered on a Bunker server─the Operator presumably uploaded it as an emergency backup due to imminent danger. With this data, it may be possible to simulate 21O's consciousness to take control of defense systems and peripherals. This file will be shared with all currently deployed units."
350,"Saved Message History"
351,"Regarding the laundering of standard-issue attire:
All clothing issued by YoRHa must be turned in for washing on the appropriate day, as detailed below. Late laundry will not be accepted.
Combat attire: Upon return from deployment (accepted through the following morning)
Civilian attire: Every Sunday

394,"■Basic Rules
Players can enter Save the Queen areas solo or in a party. It is possible to form a party even after entering the instance.

■Requirements
A Disciple of War or Magic level 71 or higher is required to enter.

■Restrictions
Once inside, you are free to change to any Disciple of War or Magic that meets the requirements to enter. However, you cannot change jobs while participating in a critical engagement.

All forays in Save the Queen areas are level synced, with character levels adjusted to 80, and all equipment adjusted to item level 430. Furthermore, materia bonuses will be ignored, regardless of the item level of gear affixed with materia. Any experience points gained will apply to your job level prior to level sync."

After earning sufficient mettle, speak with the Resistance commander at any nearby encampment to be promoted.

Your rank and mettle earned will be retained between visits─progress will not be lost when you depart Save the Queen areas."
396,"Falling in battle will incur a penalty.

■Incapacitation Penalty
A portion of the mettle required to reach your next rank will be lost upon incapacitation.

■Return Penalty
After being incapacitated, using Return to retreat from the battlefield to a nearby encampment will incur an additional penalty of lost mettle. This penalty can also be incurred by leaving the instance while incapacitated.

The amount of mettle lost is dependent on your Resistance rank. It is worth noting, however, your rank cannot go down as a result of losing mettle. Furthermore, no penalty will be incurred below Resistance rank 5."
397,"Critical engagements are special, limited encounters initiated by defeating certain adversaries in Save the Queen areas."
398,"Once a critical engagement has been initiated, players must request deployment to participate."
399,"Only a limited number of players can participate in a critical engagement. The Resistance will recruit combatants for a limited time, after which players will be randomly selected from those who registered."
400,"It is possible to gain priority deployment for critical engagements. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:

■Quartermaster's Priority Deployment
Players may receive priority deployment in exchange for Bozjan clusters by speaking to the Resistance quartermaster at any nearby encampment.

■Combatant's Priority Deployment
Players who contribute to the initiation of a critical engagement may receive priority when registering for their next deployment. It should be noted that those with combatant's priority deployment are more likely to be chosen.

When registering as a party, all party members must have the same type of priority deployment for it to be recognized."
401,"When defeating warmachina, there is a chance players will come across Bozjan clusters."
402,"These crystals can be traded to the Resistance quartermaster at any nearby encampment for various goods and services.

■Critical Engagement Priority Deployment
Bozjan clusters can be used to gain priority deployment for critical engagements.

■Item Exchange
Bozjan clusters can also be used to exchange for various items, including forgotten fragments."
403,"■Overview
Lost actions are special abilities that can only be used in Save the Queen areas. To acquire these actions, players must first find forgotten fragments, which drop occasionally when participating in skirmishes and critical engagements. These fragments can be examined by a Resistance appraiser, transforming them into lost actions.
There are a variety of lost actions to be found, some requiring a certain Resistance rank before they can be used. Any lost actions you have obtained will be automatically stored in the lost finds cache.

■Uses and Restrictions
There are six types of lost actions: offensive, defensive, restorative, beneficial, tactical, and detrimental. In certain cases, they may also be used as items rather than traditional actions.
It should be noted, however, that no one job can master them all, as each action has specific job requirements to use them."
404,"Any lost actions not currently in use can be found in the lost finds cache. The cache can hold up to 200 of any given lost action. Those that exceed this limit will be lost."
405,"To use lost actions in battle, they must first be moved from the lost finds cache to the lost finds holster. You must choose carefully, as the holster can only hold a limited number of actions. However, this limit can be increased with a higher Resistance rank."
406,"■Removing and Storing Lost Actions
Lost actions can be moved freely between the lost finds cache and lost finds holster. Be mindful, however, that the lost finds holster has a limited capacity for actions.

■Action Sets
Up to 10 combinations of your favorite lost actions can be saved as sets."
407,"While assisting the Bozjan Resistance in their fight against the Empire, you will have the opportunity to create Bozjan gear. This gear possesses special attributes which are only effective when fighting in Save the Queen areas."
408,"Using Lost Actions"
409,"Before lost actions can be used, they must first be converted into duty actions. Once converted, they will remain as duty actions even after leaving the instance, and will only expire after all uses have been depleted.

Lost actions from the item category, however, are unique in that they may be used directly from the lost finds holster. They may also be assigned to your hotbar, making them ideal for use in emergencies."
410,"■Keyboard and Mouse
All duty actions and items can be used by left-clicking their icon, but can be bound to other keys.

■Gamepad
Duty actions are used by pressing <Gui(17)/> while holding down both <CommandIcon(14)/> and <CommandIcon(15)/>. Lost actions from the item category must be selected from the lost finds holster. They may also be assigned to your hotbar."
411,"Voyage Missions"
412,"Upon boarding the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>, players will receive three missions from the captain. Mission details will be displayed in a special UI window while the voyage is underway and will vary from route to route.

A mission requirement might be “Catch sharks,” or “Catch fish with a weak bite.” Bite strength can be determined by the number of exclamation marks displayed above a fisher's head when hooking a fish:

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>! = weak bite
!! = strong bite
!!! = ferocious bite<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

To complete a mission, a player must catch the required number of designated fish, with bonus points being added to a player's score at the end of the voyage based on the number of missions completed.

If you're aiming for the highest score possible, don't let these missions be the ones that got away!"
413,"Abandoning a Voyage"
414,"Players who abandon a voyage partway through will be unable to register to board again during the current voyage's registration period.
※Unlike the usual Duty Finder penalty, this restriction only applies to Ocean Fishing.
※Boarding registration restrictions apply across all Worlds."

421,"Setting Match Rules"
422,"An Open tournament is a Triple Triad competition in which eight participants battle it out under a prearranged set of rules."
423,"■The Basics
Designed for solo players, this tournament mode pits registered participants against each other in contests of up to eight opponents.

■How to Participate
Speak with the Open tournament official in the Gold Saucer to register for the next available competition. <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Registration periods last for 30 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time).<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

The tournament will begin when 8 participants have been assembled or once the requisite amount of time has elapsed since the registration period began. If there are fewer than 8 participants available, NPCs will sit in for any missing players. Registration times may be viewed via the Open tournament schedule.

■Rewards
MGP, Triple Triad cards, and other prizes will be awarded at the end of a tournament, with final rankings and win rate determining the reward amount. Titles and items are also available as achievement rewards.

In the case that multiple players earn the same ranking, the MGP amount for the ranking reward will be adjusted accordingly. "
424,"■Tournament Style
An Open tournament consists of three matches, with participants earning points based on the outcome of each game: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. At the culmination of the third match, the participant with the most points is declared the victor.

In addition to victory points, the final number of captured cards is also recorded for each match. In the case that participants end the tournament with equal points, the player who most dominated the card grid over the course of the competition is awarded a higher ranking.

■Matching Opponents
For the first match, opponents are decided by pairing off the 8 participants at random. For the second and third matches, players are pit against whomever shares the closest point total at that stage in the tournament."
425,"■Match Rules
Regardless of any other ruleset in play, every Open tournament enforces the Draft rule. This rule guarantees a more balanced playing field by restricting participants to the use of temporary “house” cards."
426,"At the beginning of the competition, three sets of randomly generated cards will be displayed. Participants must choose one option from each set to build their deck, which will then be locked in for the rest of the tournament."
427,"Players who lack confidence in their deck-building abilities are encouraged to make use of the <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Recommended<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> button. This handy feature will automatically choose the strongest cards available.

Please note that while card options are randomized for each player, the number of rare cards on offer will always be the same.

■Rulesets
Speak with the tournament official and view the schedule to see which rules will be in effect for the upcoming competitions. Each tournament will be marked as having either a “basic” or “advanced” ruleset.

With the exception of Draft, basic tournaments have no advanced rules in play. All that is required to enjoy these matches is an understanding of the standard Triple Triad rules.

Advanced tournaments are for players who prefer their card battles with an extra layer of complexity. In addition to Draft, these contests will also feature advanced rules such as Same or Plus.

The Open tournament schedule will switch back and forth between basic and advanced rulesets, so you won't need to wait long before your preferred style of competition rolls around!"
428,"An Invitational tournament is a Triple Triad competition which follows the same basic structure as an Open tournament, with the main difference being that there are no rewards on offer. Participants may also register at any time as either a solo player or as a party.

■How to Participate
Players seeking the thrill of tournament play can form a party and register to enter the Triple Triad Invitational Parlor via the Duty Finder. In the case that a player registers solo, or a party has less than 8 members, the missing numbers will be made up by Triple Triad regulars or Gold Saucer employees.

■Rematches
At the end of an Invitational tournament, you will have the opportunity to organize a rematch. If every player agrees to the rematch, you can begin a new tournament with the current participants without needing to leave or re-register the party. Up to three rematches are available per tournament registration."
429,"■Setting the Rules
Invitational tournaments have no set rules in play."
430,"Upon entering the Parlor, the party leader is tasked with deciding which rules will apply during the competition. With the exception of Sudden Death and Random, any combination of up to four different advanced rules can be set. <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Remember: you must deselect Draft if you wish to battle using your own custom-built decks.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

For the sake of a harmonious experience, it is strongly suggested that players agree upon a ruleset before commencing registration!"

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　- Konogg"
433,"Dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>,

I found out that 2B and 9S accessed the spheres before this all started, which is why they knew about the machine lifeforms' plans to take over our world. They added their own data to that of the machine lifeforms when copies were being made─like some sort of technological virus, apparently─so that they could come here and stop the machines.

497,"Overview"
498,"Resistance Honors"
499,"Proofs of Mettle"
500,"Resistance honors are awards granted to those who have demonstrated exemplary heroism and courage on the battlefield. 

To receive Resistance honors, you must first amass sufficient mettle and speak with the Resistance councilor to receive proofs of mettle. These may then be exchanged for honors of your choosing.

Once in your possession, Resistance honors will grant enhanced attributes while undertaking duties in Save the Queen areas."
501,"There are three types of Resistance honors, and you can hold up to ten of each. The more of these honors in your possession, the greater their effect.

It should be noted, however, that the required number of proofs of mettle increases as you earn more Resistance honors. Their effects are as follows:

■Sun of Fortitude
Increases maximum HP.

■Sun of Valor
Increases damage dealt.

■Sun of Succor
Increases healing potency."
502,"Proofs of mettle can be received from the Resistance councilor in exchange for mettle.

After receiving a sufficient number of proofs, they may then be exchanged for Resistance honors.

Proofs of mettle do not occupy inventory space, and the number in your possession can be confirmed at any time via the HUD."
503,"Solo Engagements"
504,"Players who exhibit exemplary performance during certain critical engagements may be challenged to a duel by enemy combatants.
In the event more than one player has accepted an invitation to duel, one will be selected from among them at random.

Should you be chosen, make certain you are duly prepared and keep lost actions at the ready─these engagements are not for the faint of heart."
505,"Notoriety"
506,"In the event you are not chosen to duel, your participation in the prerequisite critical engagement will earn you notoriety. As your notoriety increases, so too will your chances of being chosen to duel.

It should be noted, however, that all notoriety is lost when you are selected."
507,"Large-scale Assaults"
508,"Large-scale assaults are duties in Save the Queen areas wherein up to 48 players enter imperial strongholds.

These duties become available when a certain number of eligible players are in the area, and a sufficient amount of time has passed.

Coordination and teamwork are key to overcome the various pitfalls and powerful enemies that await within."
509,"Wildlife Encounters at Sea"
510,"While sailing the seas on the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>, you will occasionally come across dolphins and seagulls. Sailors, notorious for their superstitious beliefs, consider such encounters to be omens of good fortune─the appearance of a lively pod or raucous flock is said to be a boon for fishing, and even influence the likelihood of a spectral current.

Be sure to pay close attention when your voyage is favored by these unexpected visitors!"
511,"Initiating Large-scale Assaults"
512,"When seeking to initiate large-scale assaults, it should be noted that the completion of critical engagements and skirmishes will reduce the time remaining before a large-scale assault may be triggered."

591,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Tier■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each player will rate in one of six tiers─Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, or Crystal. Players ranked in or below the Platinum tier will never drop down to a lower tier during that season. However, it is possible to drop to a lower tier from the Diamond or Crystal tiers.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Riser■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
The sub-levels within each tier are called “risers.” The number of risers varies per tier, with three risers each for Bronze and Silver, four for Gold and Platinum, and five within the Diamond tier. Regardless of tier placement, it is always possible for players to drop down to a lower riser.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Rising Stars■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser. Winning three or more matches in a row while in the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Diamond tier will apply a streak bonus, netting you two Rising Stars per win.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■The Crystal Tier■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Once you have reached Crystal, the highest tier, victory and defeat will be reflected by your Crystal Credit, rather than Rising Stars. The amount of Credit you earn or forfeit in matches is determined by the difference in average Credit between your team and the opposing team. Streak bonuses do not apply to Crystal Credit.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Resets■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
At the end of each season, the tier and risers of all participants will be lowered, the amount by which will vary between seasons."
592,"Rules of Engagement"
593,"Success in Crystalline Conflict depends on each team's ability to gain control of the tactical crystal and deliver it to the goal. "
594,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Victory Conditions■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
To win, one team must move the tactical crystal from the center of the field to the goal point. If neither team accomplishes this during the time limit, victory will be awarded to the team with greatest progress. “Progress,” displayed on the HUD throughout the match, indicates the maximum progress a team has made in bringing the tactical crystal toward their goal at any point during the match─as opposed to its current position relative to either goal─and thus will never decrease even should the crystal be reclaimed by the opposing team.

If neither team reaches the goal by the time limit, and progress for both teams is tied or the team with lower progress score is currently within the ring around the tactical crystal, the match will proceed into overtime. During overtime, the victory conditions differ depending on both teams' progress.

・Should your team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must keep the entire opposing team out of the ring around the tactical crystal for three seconds to win.

・Should the opposing team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat their progress score during overtime to win.

・Should the teams have equal progress scores upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat the opposing team's progress score during overtime to win.

Should neither team fulfill victory requirements by the end of overtime, the following conditions will apply:

・The team with the greater progress score will be awarded victory.

・If teams have equal progress scores, the team with the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime will be declared the winner.

・If teams had equal progress scores upon the commencement of overtime and have equal progress scores by the end of overtime, victory will be awarded to the team that moved the tactical crystal closest to the goal point. If the tactical crystal remains at the center of the field, the match will end in a draw."
595,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■The Tactical Crystal■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
The all-important object placed at the arena's centerpoint is called the “tactical crystal.” It will remain bound until the first 20 seconds of the match have passed."
596,"Once the tactical crystal is unbound, a ring will appear at its base. Should one team be fully in control of this ring─with no members of the opposing team present within its bounds─that team will be able to move the crystal.

The crystal can only be moved along the crystal line─a dedicated path within the arena. It will move faster when:
・It reaches a stretch of the line through which the same team has moved it before.
・The controlling team's progress is less than that of the opposing team.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Checkpoints■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Checkpoints can be found halfway between the centerpoint and each team's goal."
597,"Upon reaching a checkpoint, the tactical crystal's progress will be halted temporarily. The team attempting to clear the checkpoint must remain in the crystal's ring until the Clear Progress gauge reaches 100%, at which point the crystal can once again be moved.

The Clear Progress gauge will fill when the team attempting to clear the checkpoint has more players in the crystal's ring than the opposing team, and the gauge will fill faster the larger this discrepancy is."
598,"Features"
599,"Crystalline Conflict arenas include a variety of tactically useful elements to make matches more dynamic. These include arena events, designed to complement the specific arena in which they occur, as well as the following features:

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Medicine Kits■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each arena comes equipped with medicine kits. Accessing these kits will restore a player's HP.

Medicine kits cannot be claimed by those whose HP is at 100%, and each can only be claimed by one player. Once a kit has been claimed, a replacement will be generated after a set period of time has passed."
600,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Sprint Zones■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

Stepping on a jump glyph will rapidly transport you to a specific location on the field."
602,"Arenas"
603,"The Palaistra"
604,"Inspired by the iconic architecture of the Northern Empty, this glamour-woven arena features no specialized gimmicks─so there can be no doubt that to the superior team goes the glory."
605,"The Volcanic Heart"
606,"This staging ground lies at the foot of a volcano no less volatile for its artificial nature. If you can't take the heat, abandon all hope of victory."
607,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Eruptions■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
The Volcanic Heart periodically erupts, scattering self-destructing bombs across the field. Those who fail to avoid their explosive radii will take damage."
608,"Bomb cores will remain at the site of bombs' destruction, granting those who acquire them the following:
・An effect increasing damage dealt for a short time. Stacks up to 10 times.
・A boost to the limit gauge."
609,"Cloud Nine"
610,"Though the cloudtops may be illusory, the turbulence in this arena feels real enough! Ride its winds to victory...or defeat."
611,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Turbulence■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Players cast up into the air by turbulence will take damage upon being returned unceremoniously to the ground. However, they may acquire black chocobo feathers while in the air, granting them the following:
・A soft landing, nullifying the typical damage taken from turbulence.
・An effect increasing attack speed and movement speed for a short time.
・A boost to the limit gauge.

The locations of black chocobo feathers are indicated by markers on the ground. Those who do not wish to go flying can negate the effects of turbulence by using Guard."
612,"Turbulence also leaves behind a twister and gale sphere at the site where it occurred. Stumbling into these twisters will result in damage and knockback. If your Guard is active, it will be depleted by the twister.

Gale spheres, on the other hand, will greatly increase movement speed. Only one player may use any given gale sphere, and they will reappear after a fixed period of time while turbulence is active."

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Retaliation■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Incapacitated players will be returned to their base, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay─however, this delay increases with each incapacitation. Players will return to their senses with HP and MP fully restored and all action recast timers reset. Furthermore, they will be invulnerable so long as they remain at their base. This effect will be lost upon returning to the battlefield.

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>“Gleeful,” “Chipper,” “Content,” “Unhappy,” and “Hostile.”<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

773,"Isleworks handicrafts are artisanal goods made from your island's natural resources. Traders in Limsa Lominsa will be happy to pay a sum of seafarer's cowries in exchange for these goods, allowing you to live your dream of running an island-based small business!

In case breaking a sweat isn't your cup of tea, fear not─a team of mammets will create and ship all handicrafts for you. You need only speak to the tactful taskmaster to design the production schedule, then sit back, relax, and watch the cowries pour in."
774,"Managing a workshop's schedule may seem daunting at first, but once you grasp the basics, handicraft production will feel as refreshing as a tropical breeze! As an example, let's try scheduling the production of an isleworks potion.

■Press Plus to Schedule
The plus button on the Isleworks Agenda screen indicates an opening in your schedule. Select this button to get started."
775,"■Choose Your Handicraft
After pressing the plus button, a menu of all handicrafts currently available for production will open. In keeping with our example, select “Isleworks Potion” from the list. You will notice that the materials required to create a given handicraft are displayed on this screen, but you can still schedule an item even if you don't have all the materials just yet.

Navigating the nuances of market demand will offer you even greater profits than simply renovating your facilities or activating efficiency bonuses.

■Market Research
You may review the current state of the market by selecting the “Review Supply & Demand” button in the top right-hand corner of the Isleworks Agenda interface."
781,"・Popularity

The more popular an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Popularity may change at the beginning of a new season, but it will remain constant throughout that season.

・Supply
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Items will be in one of the following fives stages of supply: Nonexistent, Insufficient, Sufficient, Surplus, and Overflowing.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

The less abundant an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Furthermore, the supply of handicrafts may change each cycle according to both commercial trends in Limsa Lominsa and the type/amount of items you sell from your island.

You can check shifts in demand from the previous cycle to the current one by referencing the “Demand Shift” column of the Supply & Demand interface.

If you produce too much of the same product, the market will be inundated with it, causing supply to become “Overflowing.” Pay special attention to changes in the market when looking to create a large amount of a single kind of handicraft."
782,"A variety of resources are necessary for the production of handicrafts. You may confirm what materials are required for your workshop's current schedule by selecting “Review Materials” and accessing the Material Allocation interface."
783,"You may review the necessary materials for the current cycle, current season, or both current and next season. If a deficit appears for any materials, please be sure to acquire them by the start of scheduled production."

785,"The Earnings Report displays total profits for the current season, the previous season, and the highest recorded profits for any season.

The value of the handicrafts you sell will fluctuate depending on their popularity and demand at the time they are sold. You can check the fluctuation in their value by reviewing the “Value Change” column in the earnings report menu.

If your earnings for a particular season are not what you expected, be sure to check how the handicrafts you chose may have affected market supply and demand."
786,"Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonuses, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>"
787,"Efficiency Bonuses"
788,"The Path to Profits"
789,"With an agenda in hand and a team of eager mammets at your disposal, you are free to make any and all handicrafts your heart desires. However, a very special bonus awaits those who choose their schedules cleverly.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>The efficiency bonus will double the production of a given handicraft without requiring additional materials or production time.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

Doubling the production of a handicraft means you will have two handicrafts to export, and basic mathematics tells us that two handicrafts will sell for twice as much as one handicraft will. So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!

■Activating Efficiency Bonuses
All handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as “Concoctions” or “Confections.”

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Efficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling."
790,"But wait! There's more.

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by <Emphasis>another</Emphasis> isleworks potion?

Thanks to efficiency bonuses, what might have been only three handicrafts has now been expanded to five! Think of the profits! Keep in mind both the type and order of handicrafts you add to your agenda, and you will be swimming in an abundance of seafarer's cowries in no time.

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

When aiming for bonuses, be sure you are scheduling different handicrafts. Variety, after all, is the spice of island life."
791,"Now that you have taken your first steps down the path to profits, you may be curious as to how to increase your earnings even further than what a simple efficiency bonus might afford.

When you feel ready to take the plunge into the intricacies of the handicraft trade, access the Guide in your islekeep's index and check the section titled “The Workshop.”

The player with the greatest enmity is marked with A, followed by 2, 3, and so on. The adjacent gauge shows the relative difference in enmity compared to the player with the most."
1108,"During party combat, if you find that the enemies are swarming you instead of the tank, you may wish to withhold your attacks until the tank has regained enmity.

■ Tank Stance
Each tank job has a special action that helps to keep their enmity level high."
1109,"With tank stance active, attacks dealt to enemies will generate significantly higher enmity, controlling the focus of enemy attacks and thereby helping to keep allies safe. This is a key aspect of playing as a tank in party combat."
1110,"Enhancements and Enfeeblements"
1111,"An enhancement is a status effect that strengthens the player, whereas an enfeeblement is one that weakens the player. The icons for enhancements and enfeeblements you receive will appear in the Status Effects element of your HUD layout."
1112,"Enhancements have icons shaped like upward arrows, whereas enfeeblements are shaped like downward arrows. A white line across the top of the icon indicates that the enfeeblement can be removed with certain healing actions such as Esuna."
1113,"Types of Markers"
1114,"Targeting Markers"
1115,"This marker indicates that you have been targeted with some manner of attack."
1116,"The specifics of the ensuing attack will vary depending on the enemy and/or duty, but in all cases, it will involve you in some way."
1117,"Area of Effect Markers"
1118,"This marker indicates that you have been targeted with an area of effect attack. Targeted players should move away from their allies, and vice versa."
1119,"Stack Markers"
1120,"This marker indicates that a powerful area of effect attack is imminent. As a stack marker is all but impossible to survive alone, it is imperative that the targeted player stand with as many allies as possible to divide the damage evenly.

Note that there are two different types of stack marker:

■ Circle Stack"
1121,"■ Line Stack"
1122,"Lethal Attack Markers"
1123,"This marker warns of an incredibly powerful attack. Typically, it targets the player with the most enmity, and because it deals tremendous damage, most non-tank jobs are unlikely to survive it.

Should you be targeted, your defensive abilities can help keep you safe. For example, tanks can use Rampart to lower damage sustained as well as Reprisal to lower enemy damage output. For all other roles, check the Actions & Traits menu to see which defensive abilities your job can learn.

Note that there are a few different markers, each with different areas of effect:"
1124,"■ Solo Marker
Depending on the enemy, these may inflict an area of effect attack."
1125,"■ Area of Effect Marker"
1126,"■ Line / Cleave Marker
These attacks will strike the entire area behind the target."
1127,"■ Stack Marker
The spheres orbiting the center indicate how many players are needed to withstand the attack."
1128,"Homing Area of Effect Markers"
1129,"This marker indicates that you will be chased by a series of area of effect attacks targeting your current location.

Because these attacks will strike rapidly and repeatedly, the best course of action is to stay on the move, away from your allies."
1130,"Knockback Markers"
1131,"This marker indicates that a knockback attack is imminent. When it strikes, you will be pushed a set distance away from the point of impact based on your relative location. Keep this in mind and either position yourself accordingly or use an action that nullifies knockback effects."
1132,"Note that there are different types of knockback:

■ Radial Knockback
Players will be pushed outwards from the point of impact. If the marker is purple, like this one, it cannot be nullified by job actions."
1133,"■ Directional Knockback
Players will be pushed in a single set direction."
1134,"Area of Effect Knockback Markers"
1135,"This area of effect marker has an accompanying knockback effect. When it strikes, you will be pushed a set distance away from the point of impact based on your relative location. You will take damage if you stand inside its bounds, so you should position yourself along its outer edges."
1136,"If the marker is purple, like this one, it cannot be nullified by job actions."
1137,"Flare Markers"
1138,"This marker indicates that a proximity-based area of effect attack is imminent. The closer you stand to its point of impact, the more damage you will take, so retreat as far as you can."
1139,"Sometimes these proximity attacks will target a specific player. To minimize damage, the target should move away from the rest of their party, and vice versa. "
1140,"Tower Markers"
1141,"This marker indicates that a tower attack is imminent. If left unoccupied by at least one player, the entire party will take significant damage."
1142,"Note that there are different tower markers with different effects:

■ Tank Tower
This type of tower hits especially hard. Only a tank should occupy it."
1143,"■ Multi-player Towers
Some towers require a specific number of players to fully absorb the attack. This number will be indicated by the marker. Displayed below are two examples of two-player towers."
1144,"Proximity Tether Markers"
1145,"This spiky marker indicates that you have been tethered to a hostile force. Remain in close proximity and you will receive some manner of negative effect, be it damage or an enfeeblement.

Fortunately, this type of tether can be negated by moving away until the spikes disappear, like so:"
1146,"Another type of proximity tether, also known as a chain, will continuously damage both players to whom it is connected so long as they remain in close proximity of one another. Affected players can break this tether by moving away from each other."
1147,"Interceptible Tether Markers"
1148,"This marker indicates that an attack will strike the current target. Depending on the situation, it may be necessary for a player to intercept it by physically blocking it from its target."
1149,"Gaze Markers"
1150,"This marker indicates that a gaze attack is imminent. Any player facing the enemy when this attack strikes will receive some manner of negative effect. Alternatively, sometimes the gaze marker will originate from a player instead.

In both cases, it can be negated by facing away from its source before the attack strikes."
1151,"Other Markers"
1152,"Here you will find descriptions of other attack markers encountered in combat.

■ Number Markers
These markers indicate the order in which players will be attacked, starting with the player whose marker has the fewest orbs."
1153,"■ Multi-player Markers
This marker indicates the number of players who must stand together to survive the attack, as shown by the number of orbs."
1154,"■ Countdown Markers
These markers count down to an imminent attack, and if you are caught doing a forbidden action when it reaches zero, you will be penalized with damage or an enfeeblement.

All countdown markers serve the same function regardless of enemy or duty, and over time you will learn the forbidden actions typically associated with each one."

1232,"On the Occult Crescent, players must explore widely and overcome deadly threats, all in aid of unraveling the isle's mysteries."
1233,"■Basic Rules
Players can enter the Occult Crescent solo, in a party, or in an alliance of between nine and 48 players. It is possible to form a party even after entering the instance.

■Requirements
A <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Disciple of War or Magic level 100 or higher<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> is required to enter, and the <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>required average item level is 690<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.

■Restrictions
Once inside, you are free to change to any Disciple of War or Magic that meets the requirements to enter. However, you cannot change jobs in certain circumstances, including while participating in a critical encounter.

All expeditions on the Occult Crescent are level synced, with <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>character levels adjusted to 100, and all equipment adjusted to item level 700<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>."
1234,"Progress during the expedition is represented by your <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>knowledge level<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, with all players starting at level 1.

Discrepancies between your knowledge level and that of your enemies can greatly impact the outcome of a battle. Caution is advised when engaging a foe with a knowledge level greater than your own."
1235,"Players can accumulate <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>knowledge<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>─akin to experience points─by defeating enemies and completing quests on the Occult Crescent.

Slaying foes with a knowledge level higher than your own will garner more knowledge. Players may choose to form parties and take on such adversaries to reap the increased knowledge reward.

Knowledge can also be earned by participating in critical encounters and FATEs across the island.

Your knowledge level and accrued knowledge will be retained between excursions─progress will not be lost when you depart the Occult Crescent."
1236,"Falling in battle while out on an excursion will incur a penalty. <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>If you are incapacitated and return to base camp without being revived, you will lose a portion of your knowledge.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> The amount of knowledge lost is dependent on your knowledge level. Players who leave the instance while incapacitated will also receive the aforementioned penalty.

Furthermore, <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>if your knowledge level is above 5, incurring the penalty can decrease your knowledge level<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> if your knowledge falls below zero as a result."
1237,"While exploring the Occult Crescent, players can utilize additional, supplemental jobs known as <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>phantom jobs<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.

Although only one phantom job may be selected, under most circumstances you are free to make a different selection at any time. Leveraging various phantom jobs as the need arises may be the difference between victory and defeat out in the field."
1238,"Utilizing a phantom job to defeat your adversaries will garner <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>phantom EXP<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>. Earning sufficient phantom EXP will increase the level of your selected phantom job, granting access to a variety of <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>offensive, restorative, and supplemental phantom actions<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>."

■Registering Phantom Actions to the Hotbar / Cross Hotbar

■Quest Sync
The difficulty of crafting and gathering missions, as well as the amount of experience earned, will be adjusted to your current level at the time of commencement.

■Crafting and Gathering Restrictions
During a stellar mission, crafting and gathering will not award experience, and spiritbond will accrue at a different rate.

■Fishing Restrictions
At the end of each stellar mission, your Angler's Art stacks will be reset, regardless of how many you have accrued.

■Ground Support Bonuses
Ground supporters who make sufficient contributions to a mech op will receive bonus credits for a certain number of subsequent missions, regardless of objective. These bonuses are as follows:

Cosmocredits: +10
Lunar Credits: +10

For the duration of the effect, an arrow symbol will be displayed on the Initiate button on the mission selection window."
