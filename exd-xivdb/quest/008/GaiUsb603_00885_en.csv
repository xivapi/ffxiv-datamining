Idristan has given you a chunk of fetid dodo flesh to be used to draw out the beasts. Find a suitable place to set down the meat, and slay the jackals that appear."

The Calamity has left Coerthas nigh uninhabitable, and the local wildlife have become more dangerous as a result. If you plan on heading northwest, the Quiverman warns you to be prepared."
