2,"TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_SEQ_02","While Miounne appreciates the button's exquisite craftsmanship, she is unfamiliar with its sigil. She suggests you show it to Bernadette, the keen-eyed sentry who stands guard at the Aetheryte Plaza."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_SEQ_03","Unfortunately, Bernadette does not recognize the lily sigil. In her turn, she suggests that you have it examined by Wood Wailer Ceinguled, who stands before the Lancers' Guild."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_SEQ_04","Ceinguled recalls having seen a man named Ursandel wearing an identical button upon the breast of his jacket. You will find him by the entrance to the Gentry's Ward, northwest of the Lancers' Guild."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_SEQ_05","Ursandel instantly recognizes the sigil as that of the old and proud Dartancours family. With a sigh of resignation, he agrees to reveal the truth behind the mysterious murders...on the condition that you promise to help him with what will most certainly be an unsavory task."
