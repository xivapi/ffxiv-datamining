1,"TEXT_GAIUSB602_00884_SEQ_01","According to Vortefaurt, the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enterprise\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 disappeared over the mountains of Coerthas to the northwest. Presuming it was not destroyed during the Calamity, he recommends that you elicit the cooperation of the astrologians at the Observatorium, who were doubtless monitoring the skies that night and possess information that may be valuable to the search. However, as Ishgardians are wont to turn away outsiders, Vortefaurt advises you to first offer your services to the soldiers who guard the Observatorium, as a gesture of goodwill."
