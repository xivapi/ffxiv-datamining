Should you wish to learn more, Imme advises you to search for an Immortal Flames representative outside the gates to the Goblet in western Thanalan."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS804_01213_SEQ_02","Momoraji explains that only adventurers will be permitted to settle in the Goblet, as part of an initiative to encourage their immigration to Ul'dah. Though it would require substantial funds to build and maintain an estate, he assures you that it would be well worth the expense, and encourages you to visit the Goblet so that you may see the lands for yourself."

4,"TEXT_SUBCTS804_01213_SEQ_04","Alas, the recruit confirms that Ul'dahn citizens are prohibited from purchasing plots in the Goblet. Doubtless many adventurers will flock to the region\xe2\x94\x80and many Ul'dahns like Imme will envy them deeply. Perhaps it would be best if you were the one to deliver the bad news to her."

Should you share her dream of home ownership, it would behoove you to speak with the resident caretaker in the Goblet to learn more."
