Subdue the Flamefang ravagers you encounter in the south of Zanr'ak, and douse them with water from the heavy glass flasks at the moment of your victory."

50,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_NARUJIBOH_000_002","Among the Amalj'aa, any who drinks water in excess is considered a fool. And, in the same vein, dousing an opponent with the substance constitutes the gravest form of humiliation. Have you perhaps divined my intent?"
