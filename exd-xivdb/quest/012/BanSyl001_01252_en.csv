1,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_SEQ_01","Serpent Commander Heuloix is concerned about troubling movements among the sylph tribes, fearing that the typically benign beastmen are hatching a bodeful plot. With the scholar dispatched to investigate the matter having gone missing, the commander bids you go in search. Travel to Little Solace and speak to the sylph Olmxio."

This hardly matches Commander Heuloix's description of the scholar Voyce, but it should suffice as a starting point for your search. Seek out the sylph elder, Frixio, and see what light he might shed on the matter."

He also expresses considerable doubt as to the likelihood of the scholar returning alive. Return to Olmxio and see if there is anything you might do to rescue the man from harm."
4,"TEXT_BANSYL001_01252_SEQ_04","Though failing to understand your preoccupation with Voyce's well-being, Olmxio does not dissuade you from your stated aim. He gives you fair warning that the Sylphlands are fraught with many dangers for walking ones such as yourself, and encourages you to prepare thoroughly for the journey ahead."
