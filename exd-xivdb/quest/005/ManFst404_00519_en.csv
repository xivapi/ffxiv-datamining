But what if he had company? Wielding the power of the Echo, you guide him through a series of forgotten memories, detailing the path that led the once loyal engineer to turn his back on Garlemald and flee to Eorzea. When you finally awake from the visions, Cid triumphantly declares that he remembers everything\xe2\x94\x80his name, his people, and his purpose. Shortly thereafter, he guides the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enterprise\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 through Garuda's wall of wind without incident, delivering you to the Howling Eye at long last.

Yet the beastmen's prayers come to naught when Garuda's attempt to temper you fails, prompting a mysterious force to tear a Crystal of Light from her breast. It is at this moment that Gaius van Baelsar enters the fray, seemingly bent on goading the defeated primal into one final act of defiance. Garuda duly obliges, slaughtering her captive kobolds and Amalj'aa, whose cries of agony serve to summon their own patron deities. As Garuda prepares to consume the aether of her lesser brethren, the Black Wolf calls forth an unknown imperial weapon which summarily dispatches and seemingly \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03absorbs\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 all three primals.
