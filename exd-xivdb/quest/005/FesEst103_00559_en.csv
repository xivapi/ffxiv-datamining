Unbeknownst to you or the Dreamers, the enormous eggs from Jihli's vision were actually Allagan doomsday devices, relics of the ancient empire that would have reduced Eorzea to ruins had they been left unattended. Realizing with some discomfort that it was luck alone that led to the weapons' discovery and deactivation, Baderon bids you never to speak of this knowledge to anyone, lest they live their lives in fear of what other unholy menaces sleep unnoticed beneath the soil."
