Claiming that hunters have no business slaying bothersome pests, he instead plans to bestow a purse of gil to any adventurer willing to do his work for him\xe2\x94\x80and you eagerly accept the offer. Head to the highlands near the southeast camp and rid the forest of three chocobo legtraps."

His chief decides to give him the benefit of the doubt, assigning him a series of new tasks that include everything besides hunting. Hervoix reluctantly accepts this new work and sulks back to his post at Tailfeather. Now that he is out of earshot from his chief, try asking him once again for your promised reward."
