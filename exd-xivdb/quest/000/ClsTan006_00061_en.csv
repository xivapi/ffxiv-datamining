1,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_SEQ_01","Displaying what could be misconstrued as guilt, Geva asks you to speak with a client whom she had forcibly removed from the guild prior to your arrival. Search Old Gridania for the poor fellow and obtain more information about his request."

In desperation, the hapless fellow turned to the Leatherworkers' Guild and begged them to complete his commission before his son's enlistment ceremony. Sadly, however, he found the guildmaster less than eager to listen to his tale. Speak with Geva and see what she has to say."

51,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_GEVA_000_4","Mere moments ago, we received an older gentleman who demanded that we give his commission priority.

52,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_GEVA_000_5","Could you, perhaps, speak with this client on my behalf? I am told he was last seen heading east, in the direction of the market stalls. Of course, he may have gone further than that, but being an energetic adventurer, I'm sure you'll find him eventually."
53,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_CAMILLAIN_000_10","You...you are a leatherworker? Thank you for coming to see me... I know that my behavior at the guild was inexcusable."
54,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_CAMILLAIN_000_11","Permit me to start from the beginning. I heard tell of a new brand of leather goods that was cheaper than Fen\x02\x1f\x01\x03Yll but just as well made. Not being a wealthy man, I saw no reason to spend the extra gil, and purchased some of this Angrbotha-branded leather armor for my boy...only to be disappointed."
55,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_CAMILLAIN_000_12","To an untrained eye it may seem fit for purpose, but I served as a Wood Wailer for many years and could tell at a glance that it was no match for Ixali weapons."
56,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_CAMILLAIN_000_13","Aye, they made it fast and cheap as advertised, but had I known the quality would be so bloody awful, I would have found the extra gil and gone to Fen\x02\x1f\x01\x03Yll Fineries in the first place."
57,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_CAMILLAIN_000_14","I know what I ask is unreasonable, but my boy is about to enlist in the Wailers, and I wanted to give him something that would last a lifetime\xe2\x94\x80something that his son could wear when the time came.

83,"TEXT_CLSTAN006_00061_GEVA_000_63","I wonder if they'll even consider participating in the exhibition... On the one hand, there is no better way to publicize your brand, while on the other, they must surely know that they're in no position to compete with real leatherworkers."
