Her premise thus established, Fufucha tells you that an order has arrived from Ul'dah for no fewer than two thousand sprigs of chamomile. The herb is known to grow around Oakwood in upper La Noscea. Harvest fifteen high-quality sprigs by way of your contribution to the group effort, and deliver them to Sandre."
