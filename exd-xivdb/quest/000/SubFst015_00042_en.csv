49,"TEXT_SUBFST015_00042_ESTAINE_000_2","I am Estaine, caretaker of this fine centerpiece of Gridanian culture, and I fear I must needs trouble you for your assistance."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST015_00042_ESTAINE_000_3","You see, it is not only well-meaning \x02\x08\x0f\xe9\x05\xff\x06women\xff\x04men\x03 like yourself who are drawn to this place. The sylphs often visit in the dead of night, long after our citizens have gone to bed."
51,"TEXT_SUBFST015_00042_ESTAINE_000_4","We have no particular objection to their presence, and they seem grateful for the accommodation. So much so, in fact, that last night they left us a token of their appreciation...in the form of vegetables. A \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03lot\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 of vegetables."
52,"TEXT_SUBFST015_00042_ESTAINE_000_5","Their generosity is more than welcome, of course...but the sheer quantity of the things makes gathering them all something of a chore. And it's not as if I don't have enough to do already. In short, I'd be most grateful for any help you could give me."
53,"TEXT_SUBFST015_00042_ESTAINE_000_10","Well done, friend. Mih Khetto herself would sing you praise."
54,"TEXT_SUBFST015_00042_ESTAINE_000_11","She knew well the power of art, how it could strengthen the soul of a nation and preserve its history for future generations. This amphitheatre was her greatest gift to Gridania, and it was her wish that all folk use it freely\xe2\x94\x80not only for performances and festivals, but as a place to share memories and make new ones."
55,"TEXT_SUBFST015_00042_ESTAINE_000_12","I wonder if the sylphs come here to do just that... That said, I \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03do\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 wish they would find other ways to express their gratitude. We have no need of vegetables here, but mayhap the Carline Canopy can make use of them. Anyway, thanks be to the elementals for bringing you here today."
