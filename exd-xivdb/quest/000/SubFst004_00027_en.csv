3,"TEXT_SUBFST004_00027_SEQ_03","Annoyed at first, Artor's demeanor quickly changes when you hand him his toolbox. Embarrassed, he then explains that it was his love of the amphitheatre and respect for those who saved it that first inspired him to become a carpenter. Supposing you a fellow carpenter, he thanks you and resolves to work harder, while encouraging you to do the same."
