However, your reunion with the Garlean spy must wait, for another matter requires your immediate attention. An imperial squadron has set forth from Castrum Oriens on a mission to destroy an Alliance communications-jamming device in the South Shroud. If they succeed, Eline Roaille may well abort her secret rendezvous, thus depriving you of the chance to secure damning evidence of her treachery. Make haste to the South Shroud, and seek out the shinobi at Quarrymill who will brief you on the situation."

59,"TEXT_GAIUSE412_00080_ILBERD_000_019","An explanation is in order. You may be aware that the Garleans have their own method of communicating over great distances."
60,"TEXT_GAIUSE412_00080_ILBERD_000_020","Well, our ingenious friends at Garlond Ironworks have provided us with devices which disrupt these communications, and we have installed them around the city\x02\x1f\x01\x03states.
