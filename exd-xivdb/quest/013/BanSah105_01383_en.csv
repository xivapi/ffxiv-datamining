1,"TEXT_BANSAH105_01383_SEQ_01","According to one of Fyuu's skulking spawnbrothers, the Coral Tridents have captured a number of Maelstrom soldiers. With naught but death or \xe2\x80\x9cdrowning\xe2\x80\x9d awaiting such prisoners, the young Sahagin expects the soldiers' comrades to mount a retaliatory expedition. In order to prevent a violent disruption to the spawning grounds, Fyuu asks that you free the captured troops yourself. Approach the Sahagin sentries guarding the area, and obtain their keys\xe2\x94\x80by peaceful means if possible, forceful means if necessary."

4,"TEXT_BANSAH105_01383_SEQ_04","Though certain that the Coral Tridents curse the lone shorewalker who freed their captives, Fyuu is relieved that your actions have forestalled any retaliation by the Maelstrom. The young Sahagin, echoing the teachings of his clutchfather, appears determined to end the pointless cycle where vengeance begets only further vengeance."
