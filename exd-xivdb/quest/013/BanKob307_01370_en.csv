In the latest effort to that end, he has employed diggers fashioned for him under duress by the accomplished metalworkers of the 86th Order.

5,"TEXT_BANKOB307_01370_SEQ_05","Bo Bu is overjoyed to hear of your success, relishing the knowledge that the 789th will be competing on even terms with Zo Ga's favored ones, at least for the day. Though the young dustman at times suffers from overzealousness, you would not be averse to seeing his ambition rub off on his peers..."
