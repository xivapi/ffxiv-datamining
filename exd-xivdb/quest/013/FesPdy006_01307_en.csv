The doll may yet be saved, but due to its unique architecture, Serendipity requires peach tree oil before any repairs can be attempted. Gather petals from the peach trees in Ul'dah, that Serendipity may extract the oil needed to save the doll."

5,"TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_05","Just when it seemed that all repair efforts were for naught, the doll's eyes lit up again upon hearing Serendipity offer it to you. It would seem the doll feigned a malfunction in order to realize its one true desire: to remain in the company of the adventurer of whom it had grown so fond. The guildmaster then muses that this behavior is not unlike Princess Edvya's own ruse so many years ago. Though the contest has long since been lost, Serendipity is comforted by the knowledge that you, she, and the doll have celebrated the true spirit of Little Ladies' Day in a way that few do these days. She implores you to take the doll as your own, and grant its holiday wish."
