Posing as a courier in possession of crystals, Y'shtola will act as bait, while you and Thancred observe from a distance. Should the thieves appear, you are to subdue them by any means necessary."

This observation appears to prompt a revelation in Y'shtola, who immediately takes her leave to make inquiries. Having been placed in charge of matters in Thanalan, Thancred invites you to return with him to Horizon and report to Fufulupa."

Though he assures you that his comrades will soon hunt down the fugitive, you wonder if the task might better be entrusted to one more capable. Before you can volunteer, however, Thancred is informed via linkpearl that your services are needed elsewhere."
