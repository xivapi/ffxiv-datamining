As he ponders how you came to learn the Manderville, he and Hildibrand lock eyes momentarily, causing the inspector to inexplicably flee the scene. All is explained after Godbert catches up to Hildibrand, though, as the goldsmith proceeds to berate his son in front of all present. Brushing aside his father's legitimate complaints, Hildibrand convinces Godbert to reconstruct the shattered vase. Though the results are less than ideal, perhaps Lady Durilda will be satisfied. Return to Vesper Bay so that Maria can present the vase to her mother."

This fact, coupled with the knowledge that he, a member of the Syndicate, is also Hildibrand's father, is enough to convince the noblewoman to grant the inspector permission to assist with Briardien's investigation. Not only is Inspector Hildibrand unaware of his father's recent rise to power, he is also completely oblivious to how he personally benefited from it, as he simply states that you all must review the facts of the case with Inspector Briardien."
