To test his theory, he would \xe2\x80\x9cborrow\xe2\x80\x9d some crystalline saltpeter from the 13th Order's stores in U'Ghamaro, and deliver it to the 789th's own Ba Go, to see what destructive wonders the acolyte might fashion from such prime material. Or rather, he would have \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03you\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 do this\xe2\x94\x80there is a limit to the dustman's courage, after all."

Break the news to Bo Bu, and try to be gentle about it."
