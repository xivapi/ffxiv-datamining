1,"TEXT_BANSAH110_01388_SEQ_01","Fyuu informs you that several Sahagin warriors have slipped past the tidegates and now lurk in the shadows of the shorewalker encampments. Conduct a search of the area around Camp Skull Valley, and neutralize the infiltrators before they can endanger Novv's cause with their impatiently planned assault."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH110_01388_SEQ_02","After a series of spectacularly unsuccessful negotiations, you have removed the threat of the Sahagin infiltrators by force. Return to Novv's Nursery and report to Fyuu."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH110_01388_SEQ_03","Fyuu appears saddened but unsurprised by the bloody conclusion to your encounter beyond the tidegates. Though the thick-scaled Tridents seem immune to the barbs of reason, the young Sahagin hopes that the continued failure of their operations will one day help them to see the futility of their course."
