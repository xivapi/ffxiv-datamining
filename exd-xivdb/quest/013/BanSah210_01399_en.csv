1,"TEXT_BANSAH210_01399_SEQ_01","The Coral Tridents have seized a merchant vessel, bent on mastering the dubious art of sending shorewalker ships to their watery doom. Your task is to board the merchantman and dispatch four surfspine Sahagin. The open water being a cruel mistress to tender-skinned shorewalkers such as yourself, ask Pahh the seabeast tamer to provide you with an elbst for the journey. "

You are unmoved, having chosen your own job far more wisely than these Sahagin did. An adventurer goes everywhere, meets everyone, does anything\xe2\x94\x80then returns to clients to report the jo's success."
