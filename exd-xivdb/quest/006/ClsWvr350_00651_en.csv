1,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_SEQ_01","Wawarukka has requested your services as a weaver once more. Speak with him on Onyx Lane to learn more about the commission."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_SEQ_02","The miner explains that his previous attempt to woo Kokomo ended in failure. However, he refuses to give up, and intends to approach her wearing a new ensemble. He bids you prepare a high-quality linen shirt for this purpose. Craft the item as requested and deliver it to Redolent Rose."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_SEQ_03","To compensate for his ignorance of Ul'dahn fashion, Wawarukka enlisted the help of his friends when preparing his new outfit. Alas, the end result is a veritable hodgepodge of conflicting designs, and your linen shirt is no exception. Unable to stop the miner yet again, Redolent Rose falls to his knees and cries out in despair, only to rise to his feet moments later and excuse himself. Though it is likely a futile effort, you can only assume he wishes to pretend that the preceding events simply never occurred...\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 40."

Well, it wasn't \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03that\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 bad, but Kokomo's pa did run me off, callin' me a disgustin' pervert an' whatnot."

53,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_WAWARUKKA_012","See, one day I was makin' a delivery to Babawai's shop, when these two boys walk in an' start hasslin' the customers an' staff. So I confront the youngin's, and it gets a little heated. Long story short, I have to make 'em leave."
54,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_WAWARUKKA_013","I'm a little roughed up at this point, as you might expect. Then here comes Kokomo, all grace an' splendor, thankin' me for what I done. An' when our eyes meet, I suddenly realize that I can't hear a word she's sayin', 'cause my heart's poundin' harder an' fiercer than the Hammers."
55,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_WAWARUKKA_014","Till then, she was just a nice young girl helpin' her father.

56,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_WAWARUKKA_015","After talkin' with me mates in the bar, I'm thinkin' a more conservative approach is in order. If I wore, say, a quality linen shirt, it would show that I'm a responsible, respectable man. I'll meet you at the guild for the fittin' as usual, alright?"
57,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_REDOLENTROSE_020","Have you made your client's shirt yet? He seems quite eager to try it on."

59,"TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_REDOLENTROSE_030","Well, I think we can all agree this is far more appropriate than a leather harness!"
