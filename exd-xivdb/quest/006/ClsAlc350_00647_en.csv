Speak with Deitrich, the guild's receptionist, and arrange for the guildmaster's official duties to be channeled elsewhere."
2,"TEXT_CLSALC350_00647_SEQ_02","You learn from Deitrich that Severian's obsessive research began after the Calamity took the life of his one true love. Considering the growing disapproval surrounding the guildmaster's actions and concerned for the man's well-being, the receptionist is initially reluctant to grant your request. He eventually suggests, however, that providing one of the guild's valued patrons with a fine-quality vial of hi-ether will generate the goodwill necessary to avoid further obligations for a time. Return to Severian and tell him the good news."
3,"TEXT_CLSALC350_00647_SEQ_03","After relaying Deitrich's suggestion, you find yourself assigned the task of creating an uncommonly potent vial of hi-ether. Deliver the completed concoction to Severian."
4,"TEXT_CLSALC350_00647_SEQ_04","You have delivered to Severian your remarkably efficacious hi-ether and earned the enthusiastic alchemist's glowing praise.

66,"TEXT_CLSALC350_00647_SEVERIAN_000_033","You would, I suspect, need to purchase coffers that they might overflow with coin. Even among alchemy's more incredible inventions, the manufacture of ether stands out as a singularly profitable venture."
