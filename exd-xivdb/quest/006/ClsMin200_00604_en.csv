Though they do not see eye to eye on many things, Adalberta concurs with Deep Canyon's advice on the matter of equipment, and proposes materia as a means to augment your gear. With this in mind, she bids you obtain ninety-nine fragments of grade 1 carbonized matter, a catalyst used in the materia melding process. Dig for the substance around the De Nevelle Checkpoint in middle La Noscea, and deliver the required amount to Adalberta."

49,"TEXT_CLSMIN200_00604_ADALBERTA_000_1","...I see. In case you're wondering, the vice foreman used to be a miner himself. But more than that, he used to be my mentor."
