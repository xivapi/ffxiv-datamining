2,"TEXT_CLSGLD400_00656_SEQ_02","Gigi and Serendipity both agree that your growth as a goldsmith is undeniable. Since you have not spoken with Roroton in some time, Serendipity suggests that you deliver the staff in person. Seek out the merchant at the Ruby Road Exchange in the Steps of Nald."

Your conversation soon turns to the topic of the Jade Fox, a legendary thief and master of disguise rumored to have come to Ul'dah. Roroton urges you and your guildmates to be careful, as the Jade Fox is known to have a penchant for fine jewelry. Report to Serendipity at the Goldsmiths' Guild and inform her that the commission is complete."
4,"TEXT_CLSGLD400_00656_SEQ_04","Serendipity congratulates you on another successful assignment, and echoes Roroton's warning about the Jade Fox. However, she states that you need not worry about any commissions made through the Goldsmiths' Guild, as she will personally scrutinize each and every customer. Whether or not her confidence is justified remains to be seen...\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 45."

64,"TEXT_CLSGLD400_00656_ROROTON_000_024","And in times like these, ignorance can be a fatal failing\xe2\x94\x80especially if the rumors sweeping the markets are to be given credence."

67,"TEXT_CLSGLD400_00656_ROROTON_000_027","So you must understand why a merchant like me would feel ill at ease. There is no greater enemy to the industrious businessman than a dastardly thief who would steal his wares without compunction."
