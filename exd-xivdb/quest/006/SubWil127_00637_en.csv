To prevent the unique plants from succumbing to the desert heat, Jospaire bids you bring him some muddy water from the pond to the west."

49,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_JOSPAIRE_000_2","Ahem, you must forgive me. I was just admiring the plants taking root about this goobbue carcass, and...well, I suppose I forgot myself in the moment."
