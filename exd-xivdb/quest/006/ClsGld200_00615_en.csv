52,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_5","What do you know about materia? Wait, don't answer that. Even if you're familiar with it, 'tis my duty as guildmaster to instruct you in its applications to our craft."

65,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_19","Perhaps you're wondering who would prefer a staff with a headpiece of bone over one studded with jewels. Well, the thaumaturges favor such equipment."
