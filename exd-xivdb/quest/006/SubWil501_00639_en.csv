49,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_001","Mayhap you're interested in learning how to meld materia to gear? If so, it'd be my pleasure to teach you."
50,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_010","Ready to begin? Good! Now then, there are two important things to keep in mind when melding materia."
51,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_011","The first of these is carbonized matter, a catalyst required in the melding process. The substance is found throughout nature. If you want to know how to go about gathering it, Kokosamu there can tell you."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_012","Next, you need to be aware of materia slots. Arms and armor each have a certain number of these slots, and this determines how many pieces of materia they can host."
53,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_013","Normally, an item cannot host more pieces of materia than it has slots. However, as with most other things in life, there are certain...exceptions."
54,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_014","But this sort of knowledge is for later down the road. After you've become more experienced, you may want to broach the subject matter with Master Mutamix."
55,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_015","Now, off you go, and happy melding!"
