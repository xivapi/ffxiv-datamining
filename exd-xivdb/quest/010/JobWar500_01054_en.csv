Though you make short work of the crazed beasts, you are given little time to celebrate, as you hear further sounds of trouble within Wineport. Heading in, you are unexpectedly challenged by Curious Gorge, whom you are then forced to defeat. Thankfully, your blows knocked the sense back into him, and he has realized the folly of his ways. With the fighting at an end, speak with the militia captain before taking your leave."

His soul crystal shining once more, he vows to never again allow anger or thirst for power to cause him to lose sight of who he is. Recognizing you as the worthy successor of his ancestors and a truer warrior than he could ever be, he entrusts to you the final piece of his ancestors' armor, urging you to go forth and do his people proud."
