1,"TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_SEQ_01","Ever the dedicated academic, Alka Zolka has deciphered a significant portion of the Nymian treatise, much of which pertains to scholars. He notes that the Soul of the Scholar should have imparted to you a far more diverse repertoire of spells, and concludes that the cause may be your faerie's fifteen-hundred-year slumber. Surmising that exposure to familiar sights may kindle lost memories, he suggests that you visit the ruins of ancient Nym in outer La Noscea."
2,"TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_SEQ_02","The faerie reacts to a number of locations, seemingly straining to hear inaudible whispers. Perhaps taking in a view of the distant ruins from the western cliff will prove more effective."

53,"TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_ALKAZOLKA_000_005","The treatise indicates that Nymian scholars wielded a far more diverse repertoire of spells than you currently possess. Precisely why you lack these spells, I cannot say."
54,"TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_ALKAZOLKA_000_006","However, the fault may lie with your faerie. One could surmise that the knowledge contained within the Soul of the Scholar is essentially hers.

55,"TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_ALKAZOLKA_000_007","Hm. A thought occurs to me. If it is indeed the case that the faerie, having been sealed for fifteen hundred years, has yet to fully regain her senses, mayhap visiting a familiar location would hasten the process."
56,"TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_ALKAZOLKA_000_008","And I can think of no more familiar place than the city of Nym\xe2\x94\x80rather, what remains of it in outer La Noscea..."
