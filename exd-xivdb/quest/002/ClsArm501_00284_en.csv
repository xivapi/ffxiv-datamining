1,"TEXT_CLSARM501_00284_SEQ_01","The final round in your contest against Blanstyr is to be judged by none other than the Admiral herself. To suffer defeat before the representatives of the Maelstrom would cause untold damage to the guild's reputation, not to mention your own. You cannot afford to lose! Affix a grade three heavens' eye materia to a high-quality cobalt haubergeon, and deliver it to Sergeant Zwynberk at Hawkers' Round."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM501_00284_SEQ_02","After a rather unorthodox turn of events, Admiral Merlwyb has appraised the strength of your armor and found it superior to Blanstyr's. H'naanza, wishing to know if defeat has finally humbled the veteran artisan, bids you follow the stunned Roegadyn back to the Armorers' Guild to hear his thoughts."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM501_00284_SEQ_03","Acknowledging his loss, Blanstyr has decided to spend some time away from the forge to rethink his narrow perspective. Return to the forgemaster, and pass on the beaten craftsman's message."
4,"TEXT_CLSARM501_00284_SEQ_04","H'naanza, after hearing of your conversation with Blanstyr, explains that the Roegadyn's self-imposed isolation was to blame for his eventual downfall. The forgemaster believes that it is mutual respect and an atmosphere of friendly rivalry that truly allows an artisan to advance \x02\x08\r\xe9\x05\xff\x04her\xff\x04his\x03 craft. Though undeniably skilled, Blanstyr's hostility ultimately limited his improvement, allowing you to seize victory with superior techniques."

53,"TEXT_CLSARM501_00284_HNAANZA_000_006","Success in this third and final challenge hinges on your ability to forge what might need to be the most exquisite cobalt haubergeon in the realm.
