1,"TEXT_CLSCUL201_00259_SEQ_01","One of your guildmates, a woman named Diving Dove, has been looking strangely tense of late, but is too engrossed in her work to take the time to relax. Concerned for her well-being, Lyngsath bids you prepare her some dried prunes, in the hope that they might help to lighten her burden. The pixie plums required to make them can be obtained in the wilderness, or purchased via the market board in Hawkers' Alley."

She soon sees through your ruse, however, and takes umbrage at Lyngsath's interference. Thankfully, her mortification swiftly passes, and she admits to feeling moved by your gift, before promising to take better care of herself in future.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 25."
