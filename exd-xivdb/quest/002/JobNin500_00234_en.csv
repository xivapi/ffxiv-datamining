No longer willing or able to repress his true self, he has chosen to forsake obligation in favor of following his own heart's desire, which urges him to seek out the truth behind the traitor he hunted for so long. Prepared to face the answer he fears the most, he has resolved to undertake this final mission alone, insisting that Tsubame and you have sacrificed enough on his behalf.

Confronted by his former pupil, Gekkai shows no remorse, coolly explaining how he made a simple decision to seek out a stronger master, while at the same time guaranteeing the safety of his village over that of countless Doman commonfolk that were of no import to him. Incensed by his one-time master's callous disdain for the nation he called home, Oboro draws his blade and swears vengeance, and together you, he, and Tsubame defeat the shinobi master. After the battle, Karasu returns from his self-staged death to bequeath to you the final piece of your ninja garb, and to Oboro the soul stone that will allow him to go home to a hero's welcome, before walking off to parts unknown. His long mission finally at an end, Oboro returns to the dock storehouse. Meet him there to say your farewells."

From your experiences traveling with Oboro and Tsubame and fighting at their side, it would seem that the future of the village is in good hands."
