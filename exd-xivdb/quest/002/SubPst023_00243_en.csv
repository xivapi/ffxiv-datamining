Chagrined to find the undeliverable letter must be returned to sender, yet quick to spot opportunity in adversity, he awards the awkward assignment to his trusted trainee, that you might gain valuable experience in dealing with the wrath of a disappointed customer.

The collector speculates that Jijiroon may have gone north to buy protection from the Mamool Ja, but is unwilling to follow the trader into beastman territory without a significant increase to his fee.

The dejected Qiqirn offers his trading post in payment for his brother's assistance, but Memeroon refuses, despite the boost to his fortunes that such a transaction would entail. For despite their differences, it is only his respect for Jijiroon's business brain that drives him to succeed. Henceforth do they pledge to compete against each other not as hated foes, but as respected rivals, and to usher in a new age of prosperity for their businesses both."
