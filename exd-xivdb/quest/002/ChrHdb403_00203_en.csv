Your conversation is interrupted by Inspector Briardien, who has returned from his own investigation and demands a moment of your time."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB403_00203_SEQ_03","Piecing together your findings with the fruits of his own investigation, Briardien deduces that the Ala Mhigan gladiatrix Avila is conspiring with Ultros to claim the prize and share the victor's spoils, but remains unsure of the means by which the two intend to secure her victory. Hearing that the eight-legged receptionist hastily discarded several crates of rubbish from his office, he bids you go to Pearl Lane to recover any potential evidence."

Suspecting a possible connection between this merchant and the scheming Ultros, Briardien suggests that the two of you travel to the markets and confront the man with the evidence."
6,"TEXT_CHRHDB403_00203_SEQ_06","As Syntgoht tells it, Ultros has purchased from him multiple sacks of gold truffles, a costly foodstuff with a distinctive aroma that is appreciated by only the most discerning epicures. One such man appears when Hildibrand rushes to the scene and, after expressing displeasure at Briardien not including him in his investigation, quickly launches into a paean to his mother's recipe for roasted truffles, as Syntgoht listens intently. Convinced that no further clues are to be found here, Inspector Briardien proposes a return to the Coliseum, where the Mythril Cup is set to get underway."
