1,"TEXT_CLSBSM201_00296_SEQ_01","It appears Faezahr has made progress towards securing new contracts for the guild, largely thanks to the samples you supplied. After congratulating himself on a job well done, Brithael assigns you your next task. Not only must you craft him an iron cross-pein hammer, but you must also attach a single materia to it. Should your knowledge of materia be lacking, he suggests you consult the goblin Mutamix in central Thanalan. Prepare the requested item and deliver it to the forgemaster."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM201_00296_SEQ_02","Brithael has nothing but the highest praise for your hammer, confessing that he covets the tool for his own use. He goes on to suggest that your talents might prove key to promoting the guild's services to a wider audience\xe2\x94\x80though what that would entail remains a subject for another day.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 25."

53,"TEXT_CLSBSM201_00296_BRITHAEL_000_6","So ye'll have to get the iron on yer own, be it by minin' or buyin'. I'd sooner go to Hawkers' Alley, meself, but then it ain't my coin."

56,"TEXT_CLSBSM201_00296_BRITHAEL_000_9","Well, that essence can be turned into stuff called \xe2\x80\x9cmateria,\xe2\x80\x9d which is like a sort o' crystal that ye can attach to gear to make it stronger an' so on.
