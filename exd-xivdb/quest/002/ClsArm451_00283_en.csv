Make haste and forge the necessary high-quality items: a pair of mythril-plated caligae, a reinforced mythril elmo, and a pair of mythril sollerets. When finished, deliver the finished pieces to the waiting forgemaster for appraisal."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM451_00283_SEQ_02","Once again, H'naanza credits you for your fine work. Rather than declare you the victor, however, she has instead requested that you relinquish your armor to the guild to serve as a replacement order for the Maelstrom. Go to Blanstyr, and explain the delay in your submission."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM451_00283_SEQ_03","Although your selfless deed has guaranteed victory for Blanstyr in the second round, you have made a vital contribution to the guild's continuing survival and prosperity.
