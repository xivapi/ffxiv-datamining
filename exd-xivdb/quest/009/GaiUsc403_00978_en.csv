2,"TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_SEQ_02","Lord Portelaine confirms that four prisoners matching the descriptions of Minfilia, Urianger, Papalymo, and Tataru were observed being led into Castrum Centri. Furthermore, he informs you that two men\xe2\x94\x80likely Biggs and Wedge\xe2\x94\x80escaped from a downed imperial airship not long ago. After a brief discussion, Y'shtola decrees that the Scions will immediately begin searching for the missing engineers, conscious that the Garleans are not like to spare their lives a second time."
