1,"TEXT_GAIUSB902_00925_SEQ_01","Ser Benedict has pointed out that it would be reckless for Lord Drillemont to accept your claims without question. The knight believes that, at the very least, you should perform a few menial tasks on behalf of House Durendaire, like slaying feral crocs. A simple gesture like that will likely earn you the favor of Ser Clotairion, he adds. Take Ser Benedict's advice to heart and do as he suggests."

That they gave you a memorable challenge, one that you would proudly share with comrades over a tankard of ale. But Eorzea is no faerie-tale world, and life is not a song. Sometimes you slay a primal, sometimes not. But perhaps Ser Clotairion will have a greater appreciation for your accomplishments."
