2,"TEXT_GAIUSC301_00968_SEQ_02","According to Hedyn, ascertaining the precise location of the crystal at any given moment is difficult, due to the fact that it has been devoured by a notorious spriggan named Giggity. The creature has grown so fearsome that other spriggans, fearing for their safety, have begun to petition the kinder inhabitants of the Twelveswood for aid. One such spriggan recently visited Little Solace, and Hedyn suggests that you journey there and attempt to track down the wayward creature."
