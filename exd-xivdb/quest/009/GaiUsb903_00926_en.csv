Unfortunately, it was blown from her hands by a sudden gust of wind during a fearsome blizzard. Afraid to venture outside, she has asked that you recover the missive and deliver it to Lord Drillemont in her stead."

3,"TEXT_GAIUSB903_00926_SEQ_03","Lord Drillemont scoffs at the missive from houses Fortemps and Haillenarte, which calls for the increased reliance on foreign sellswords. He rejects the proposal without hesitation, shouting that Ishgard need not rely on outside help to win its war against Dravania. Though Nivie will doubtless not welcome the news, you should probably share with her Lord Drillemont's response."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB903_00926_SEQ_04","Nivie admits that Lord Drillemont's disdain is not unwarranted, as House Durendaire has been charged with reclaiming an outpost that House Haillenarte lost. Despite it being her duty to convey Lord Drillemont's exact words to Lord Francel, she is understandably reluctant to do so."
