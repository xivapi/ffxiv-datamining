1,"TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_SEQ_01","According to a roving chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, the Adventurers' Guild is looking for members willing to help with the festivities. As a proud \x02\x08\x1b\xe9\x05\xff\x0cguildswoman\xff\nguildsman\x03 and something of a sartorial adventurer, it would behoove you to slip on a \x02\x08*\xe9\x05\xff\x12red lady's yukata\xff\x13blue lord's yukata\x03 and take yourself to the Aftcastle. If the chief chaperone, Haermaga, is all that he is promised to be, this transaction would prove to be in your favor.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbPlease note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

In return for participating in three events, you will receive prizes, plus a special costume. Your summer wardrobe is a little lacking, and it would be well for the commonfolk to see what an adventurer is made of. And if that should prove insufficient motivation, do it for the children."
