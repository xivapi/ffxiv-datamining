If you would see what the officer is so excited about, a visit to the Hall of Flames is in order. You may present yourself to the Hunt billmaster to learn more."

He is also the man to go to should you require more information on the subject, or if you have hard-earned Allied Seals to turn in. For now, do your part to preserve the peace, and you will be richly rewarded."
