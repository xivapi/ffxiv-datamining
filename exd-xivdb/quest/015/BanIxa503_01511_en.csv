Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA503_01511_SEQ_02","Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. The forgewife believes that fifteen clear water shards and five clear water clusters should suffice. Why the Adventurers' Guild would need something obviously more suited for use in, say, a forge, is probably best left unspoken."
