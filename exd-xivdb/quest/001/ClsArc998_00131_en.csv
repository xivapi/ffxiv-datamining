57,"TEXT_CLSARC998_00131_LUCIANE_000_13","The bow's greatest advantage is its range. Unlike those arms used in other disciplines of war, it allows one to strike at the enemy from afar."
58,"TEXT_CLSARC998_00131_LUCIANE_000_14","Though the bow may not boast the destructive force of a sword or spear, its myriad strategic applications more than compensate for this shortcoming. An experienced archer can immobilize an enemy by striking a leg, or sap its strength with a poisoned arrow."
