57,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_20","Excellent! Ah, wait a moment... Would I be right in thinking you're rather new to adventuring? You are, aren't you... Oh, don't ask me how I know\xe2\x94\x80it's something that comes with experience. Anyway, I regret that you do not yet qualify for membership."
58,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_21","To be considered for a place in the guild, you must first prove that you take your work seriously. In your case, that means devoting a little more time to your present pursuit."
59,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_22","Once you have done so, I invite you to visit us again. Rest assured that there will still be minerals to mine when that day comes."

65,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_34","Never before had the sultanate seen such an influx of migrants. Endless throngs came from lands near and far, spurred on by the dream of discovering the mother lode. Alas, a harsh reality awaited them."
66,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_35","You see, the vast majority of these poor souls were miners in name alone, and they possessed neither the proper equipment nor the training to realize their dreams. To make matters worse, the mining concerns, who in those days held absolute power, did not scruple to exploit them."
67,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_36","Presented with a glut of unskilled labor, they proceeded to fill every tunnel to bursting, and atrocious working conditions soon became the norm. Miners were paid a pittance for backbreaking labor, and saw naught of the riches they unearthed."
68,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_37","Pushed to breaking point, the workers banded together to form the Miners' Guild, with the aim of improving conditions while protecting the integrity of the trade."
69,"TEXT_CLSMIN001_00192_LINETTE_000_38","Since then, we have sought to educate folk in correct mining practices, both to prevent accidents and to curb the impact that our trade has upon the environment."
