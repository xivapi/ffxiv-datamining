49,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_001","Though I hesitate to define alchemy in such narrow terms, our main field of expertise is the concoction of various potions and elixirs. There are salves to treat all manner of afflictions, not to mention miraculous libations that enhance the imbiber beyond \x02\x08\r\xe9\x05\xff\x04her\xff\x04his\x03 natural physical limits."

60,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_031","Though alchemists are presently known as the quintessential brewers of potions, the profession itself arose from the desire to achieve an as-yet-unrealized ambition."
61,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_032","The original driving purpose behind our art was\xe2\x94\x80and perhaps still is\xe2\x94\x80the discovery of a process that can transform base metals into gold or silver. And the mystical medium thought necessary to effect such a transformation is the Philosopher's Stone\xe2\x94\x80which is itself believed to have panacean properties and be capable of bestowing eternal life."
62,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_033","Though success yet eludes us, years of endless experimentation towards this golden goal had the initially unintentional consequence of unearthing a wealth of knowledge in the field of alchemical medicine."
63,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_034","Regretfully, alchemy's potential to enrich the lives of the masses was first met with a wave of distrust. As if our ability to create helpful compounds was akin to dabbling in back-alley witchcraft!"
64,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_035","The profession eventually gained credibility in Ul'dah through its integration into traditional medicine by Frondale's Phrontistery, an institution known for producing respected physicians."
65,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_036","Once the city's shift in perception became known, budding alchemists wishing to study without fear of persecution journeyed to Ul'dah from every corner of the realm. It was not long before this gathering of inquisitive minds banded together to form the Alchemists' Guild."
66,"TEXT_CLSALC001_00190_DEITRICH_037","Thus, while our organization is intensely focused on perfecting and sharing the fruits of our research, it is also of paramount importance that we uphold the reputation of alchemy itself as a legitimate discipline."
