82,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_51","Any axe worth swingin' needs two hands on the haft, an' has a blade what can make short work of a galley's mast. That's the kind o' weapon our members train to use with deceptive swiftness an' all too predictable force."

84,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_53","It all started with ships, ye see. What've ships got to do with axes, ye ask? Well, buildin' 'em would be pretty bloody difficult without a sturdy tool to lop down trees for timber."
85,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_54","An' since only the Navigator Herself knows when a ship'll run afoul of a storm or worse, it makes sense for the crew's carpenter to carry an axe on board. Aye, it all started with shipbuildin' an' ship repair. What? Am I borin' ye?"
86,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_55","Hmph. As I was sayin', any tool on a ship can become a weapon, an' the axe was perfect for hookin' yerself over the rail of an enemy vessel, lettin' loose in a whirl o' steel, an' generally layin' waste to all about ye."
