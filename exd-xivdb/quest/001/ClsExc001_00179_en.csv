49,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_1","Any axe worth wieldin' needs two hands on the haft an' has a blade what can chop clean through a galley's mast. That's the kind o' weapon our members train to use with deceptive swiftness an' brutal force."

Well, buildin' 'em would be pretty bloody difficult without a sturdy tool to lop down trees for timber."
57,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_12","An' since only the Navigator Herself knows when a ship'll run afoul of a storm or worse, it makes sense for the crew's carpenter to carry an axe on board.
