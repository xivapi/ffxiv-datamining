Though the aldgoat leather and cotton cloth you require are common in Thanalan, you need not travel to the sultanate to procure them. However, such a trip may be warranted if you know nothing of materia, as a goblin scholar living in central Thanalan is said to be an authority on the subject. Prepare the requested item and deliver it to the guildmaster."

54,"TEXT_CLSTAN004_00137_GEVA_000_6","And it goes without saying that you must make the leggings as well. To do so, you'll need cotton cloth and aldgoat leather."
55,"TEXT_CLSTAN004_00137_GEVA_000_7","Most cotton cloth is produced by the weavers of Ul'dah's Sunsilk Tapestries, while aldgoat leather is, of course, obtained from aldgoats, which roam the deserts of Thanalan."

63,"TEXT_CLSTAN004_00137_GEVA_000_32","Nowadays, of course, designs which extend to the thigh are far more popular. Soft, lightweight leggings like these provide the balance of protection and flexibility demanded by the Wood Wailers, the Gods' Quiver, and adventurers like your good self."
