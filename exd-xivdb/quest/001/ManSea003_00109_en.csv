84,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_53","The roots of arcanima can be traced back to the esoteric calculations practiced by the people of the south sea isles. It was these island folk that first discovered a method to express natural phenomena in mathematical terms."
85,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_54","Building on this process, the existing mathematical formulae were further developed into arcane geometries\xe2\x94\x80precise patterns that allowed a practitioner to weave aether into specific magical effects. The mages who invoked this new form of magic became known as \xe2\x80\x9carcanists,\xe2\x80\x9d and the school of arcanima was born."
86,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_55","Many such mages, wishing to expand their understanding of the world, took to the seas aboard trading vessels. Upon their arrival in Limsa Lominsa, arcanists found themselves welcomed into the academic elite, and soon secured positions in the realms of governance and counsel."
