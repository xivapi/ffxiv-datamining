She warns, however, that the beings will need to be presented with aether that is akin to that of your missing comrade if they are to identify her. For a blessing, it would seem that a sister of Y'shtola's has taken up residence in Gridania. Ask Tataru for more information on the woman."

A short while later, the Seedseers begin communing with the elementals, and with the ethereal beings' aid, they succeed in plucking Y'shtola from the Lifestream, insensible but alive. Kan-E-Senna duly orders her guards to bear your unconscious friend to the Roost to receive proper ministration. Make your own way there and rejoin Tataru."
