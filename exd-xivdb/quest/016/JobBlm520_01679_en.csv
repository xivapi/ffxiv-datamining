She speculates that the individual may have attempted to make contact with other black mages, namely your three beastman friends. Proceed to Burgundy Falls in eastern Thanalan and ask Kazagg Chah whether he has had any unusual guests of late."

Introducing himself as Zhai'a Nelhah, a Hearer of Gridania, he informs you that the Seedseer Council has sent him to find a certain black mage. Upon hearing of the Book of Thal, Zhai'a Nelhah believes that he may learn something useful from Lalai, and decides to pay her a visit. Return to Milvaneth Sacrarium in Ul'dah and be present for the meeting."

Waldeve was once a conjurer of Stillglade Fane, but he forsook the art of healing in order to sate his hunger for power. It seems clear that he is the thief who stole the Book of Thal, and with it seeks to unleash unspeakable destruction. Though their ideologies are completely at odds, in order to avert disaster, Zhai'a Nelhah and Lalai resign themselves to working with one another. After the Hearer takes his leave, Lalai teaches you a new spell\xe2\x94\x80Ley Lines\xe2\x94\x80which she deciphered from the Book of Nald.
