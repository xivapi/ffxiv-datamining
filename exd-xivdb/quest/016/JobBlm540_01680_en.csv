1,"TEXT_JOBBLM540_01680_SEQ_01","Lalai has received a letter from 269th Order Mendicant Da Za. Though somewhat scarce of detail, the letter requests that you meet him at Bronze Lake. The timing of this unsolicited correspondence strongly suggests that Waldeve may be involved. Travel to Bronze Lake and ask Da Za what prompted this sudden communication while Lalai reluctantly informs Zhai'a Nelhah of this development."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM540_01680_SEQ_02","You find Da Za at Bronze Lake. He explains that he was indeed approached by Waldeve. The man spoke of the Defiant and asked Da Za to share his knowledge of black magic. The wily kobold asked for time to reconsider, arranging another meeting and an opportunity to ambush the dangerous man with your assistance. Travel to the meeting point at the northeast of Bronze Lake and lie in hiding nearby while Da Za waits for Waldeve."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM540_01680_SEQ_03","Before long, the leader of the Defiant, Waldeve, arrives. He seems to have recently come into ownership of an ancient tome left by Ququruka\xe2\x94\x80no doubt the Book of Thal. Unfortunately, Da Za's cunning plan for capturing the renegade black mage failed to account for the possibility of the man simply walking away. Waldeve may be gone, but his cultists remain. They know of the secrets passed down to Da Za from his ancestor, and Ququruka's friend, Da Gu, and they plan to extract these secrets from him...by any means necessary. Intervene before the outnumbered kobold is overpowered."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM540_01680_SEQ_04","The battle with the Defiant mages is vicious and short. There are no survivors. Assist Da Za and confirm that he is unharmed."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM540_01680_SEQ_05","Da Za thanks you for your help, expressing his awe at the raw destructive power you brought to bear on his assailants. Zhai'a Nelhah, having heard of Da Za's letter from Lalai, arrives in time to witness only the aftermath of your fight. He is utterly incensed that you have left not a single cultist alive. Furious that this promising opportunity to question Waldeve's men has been squandered, he storms away to speak with Lalai. Return to Milvaneth Sacrarium and attempt to spare her from the Miqo'te's fury."
6,"TEXT_JOBBLM540_01680_SEQ_06","Zhai'a Nelhah confronts Lalai with the chilling parallels between your battle with the Defiant and the War of the Magi so many years ago. Though Lalai sympathizes with his concerns, she points out that it was not just black magic that brought about the Sixth Umbral Calamity\xe2\x94\x80white magic, too, was involved. In any case, she doubts Zhai'a's claims that you were not in full control of your powers, and proves as much by entrusting you with even more powerful magicks that she gleaned from the Book of Nald in your absence.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 56."
