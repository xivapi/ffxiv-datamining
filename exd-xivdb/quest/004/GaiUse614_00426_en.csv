2,"TEXT_GAIUSE614_00426_SEQ_02","By way of Momodi, Alianne of the 4th has requested a private meeting so that she might show you something of importance.

5,"TEXT_GAIUSE614_00426_SEQ_05","As you puzzle over the significance of the vial, a familiar voice reaches your ears. Laurentius, another man you personally recruited to the Crystal Braves, is surprised to see you out in the field so soon before the royal banquet. He tells you that he has seen no sign of Alianne on his patrol, but reassures you that if he does happen to meet with her, he will tell her that you waited. Time is growing short, yet something about the vial troubles you. Perhaps Momodi will know what to make of it."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE614_00426_SEQ_06","Momodi can offer little insight into the vial, save that it resembles those used by alchemists. Like Laurentius, she implores you not to worry about Alianne, and to turn your thoughts to more pressing matters."
