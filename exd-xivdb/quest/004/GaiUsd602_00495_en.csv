It seems he has a mind to seal the gates with himself inside. He reveals that the survivors of the Fourth Umbral Calamity prayed the tower would become a beacon of hope in the future. To make that a reality, Princess Salina\xe2\x94\x80the only remaining royal Allagan\xe2\x94\x80gave her blood and memories to her most trusted advisor. That man was G'raha's ancestor. Now, to ensure the wish of the ancients comes true, the historian has decided to put the Crystal Tower once again into a long slumber. He leaves you with a task: build a bright future. His farewells fade with the closing of the Crystal Tower. It would be best to return to Rammbroes and discuss all that has transpired."
