She has proven herself in the eyes of many spectators, and become a crowd favorite. However, now that she will face the final eight challengers, he fears his mistress needs every advantage. He bids you forge a high-quality adamantite winglet, of the same size and shape as the original Integrity. Do so, that the steward might present a truly fearsome weapon to the baroness."

Taken aback, the baroness refuses the gift\xe2\x94\x80until a few heartfelt words from her loyal steward cause her to change her mind. Yet she will not simply have it for free, and gives you the last remaining valuable of House Jervaint, the cygnine rosary, with the understanding that you will return it in exchange for her winnings in the tournament. Suddenly nervous, Baroness Laurisse leaves to find either great glory or abject failure in the final round.
