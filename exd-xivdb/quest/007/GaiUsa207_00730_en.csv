2,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_SEQ_02","The unsuspecting victims of a swarm of chigoes, Irielle and her colleague had until recently been locked in a battle for their own survival. Though thankfully none the worse for the ordeal, Irielle asks that you discourage any further such attacks by summarily slaying five of the brood."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_SEQ_03","You have exterminated the meddling chigoes and sent the rest of the brood scuttling back into the shadowy depths. Inform Irielle at Issom\x02\x1f\x01\x03Har of your deeds."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_SEQ_04","Irielle and her colleague can now continue their survey, free of the insect menace. Report your success to Yoenne at Buscarron's Druthers."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_SEQ_05","Yoenne is relieved to hear of her customers' safety, though at the same time disavowing all knowledge of Irielle's brother, or why she would be concerned with his safety."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_YOENNE_000_001","To be precise, I'm looking for an expedition team poking around in the ruins of Issom\x02\x1f\x01\x03Har, due south of here. They usually turn up at the Druthers every few days, covered in dust and hungering for a hot meal, but they've not been in for nigh on a week."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_YOENNE_000_002","Could well be that they're simply occupied with scholarly business, but they'd be running low on supplies by now, and that concerns me. Please, pay them a visit at the ruins and see if aught's amiss. You're looking for one by the name of \xe2\x80\x9cIrielle,\xe2\x80\x9d by the way. I...ah...forget the other one's name."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_IRIELLE_000_010","Yes, may I help you with something? Ah, Yoenne was concerned for our well-being? How positively sweet of her, but as you can see, we are both quite hale and decidedly not deceased."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_IRIELLE_000_011","We did, however, encounter certain practical difficulties when a veritable legion of chigoes burst forth from the depths of the pit. Your timing is impeccable, as we have only just succeeded in clambering out."
53,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_IRIELLE_000_012","In fact, since you are here, perhaps you might prevent a similar situation by slaughtering a number of the pests. Say, five or so? That should be sufficient to frighten the rest of the brood back to the shadows below."

56,"TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_IRIELLE_000_021","For Duskwight Elezen such as ourselves, it represents a valuable and unexpected opportunity to learn more about the settlement where our ancestors once dwelled."
