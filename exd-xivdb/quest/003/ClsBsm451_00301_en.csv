The forgemaster even managed to enjoy the company of Faezahr for a change, who over drinks with Brithael spoke of his latest obsession: a young female gladiator, whom he has a mind to lavish with gifts. Precisely what those gifts are to be remains to be seen, but what is clear is that Faezahr means to ask you to craft them."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM451_00301_SEQ_02","Faezahr bids you craft a pair of cobalt knuckles, a buccaneer's bardiche, and a cobalt shamshir worthy of his gladiator muse, Muriel. Naturally, it will be necessary for him to first inspect and approve of the weapons prior to delivery. Craft the items to the best of your ability and present them to Faezahr when finished."

In any case, the commission is complete; should Faezahr be unsatisfied with the result, the fault will not lie with you.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 50."
