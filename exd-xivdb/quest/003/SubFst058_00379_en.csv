2,"TEXT_SUBFST058_00379_SEQ_02","Roseline saw something similar, but believes it to be nothing significant. However, should you find anything unusual, she asks you to show it to her. Search the woods to the north for any signs of the shadowy figure."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST058_00379_SEQ_03","Next to the still-warm remnants of an old campfire, you discover a worn leather bag. Deliver the bag to Roseline and see what she has to say."
4,"TEXT_SUBFST058_00379_SEQ_04","At first, Roseline judges the bag to be nothing more than a traveler's forgotten pouch. However, after deeper consideration, she finds it highly suspicious for a traveler to make camp in woods filled with dangerous beasts when Bentbranch Meadows would provide safe shelter. She thanks you for your diligence and resolves to be more vigilant."
