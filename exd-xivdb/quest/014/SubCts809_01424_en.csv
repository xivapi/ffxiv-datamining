2,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_SEQ_02","It turns out the sacks contained soil and seeds that will aid Nanalai in becoming a farmer. As wild as the scheme seems, the soon-to-be former fisher struck you as no fool. Now, hurry back to Vesper Bay, for Tatafu is owed payment for the merchandise."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_SEQ_03","Tatafu is dubious of the fisherman's chances, but admits to knowing little of the farming trade. While the same could be said of you, you cannot help but find your thoughts wandering back to the extra seeds you were given, and the idea of a small garden all your own..."
