To that end, he asks you to seek them out in the caves south of Lost Hope and challenge their leaders, twin sellswords, to combat and defeat them as all watch."

Return to the Hall of Flames in Ul'dah and share your findings with Commander Swift."

That joy soon gives way to anger as you share the revelation that a single merchant has influenced recent events so greatly. The high flame commander declares that the merchant must be apprehended at once; doubtless he desires your help in this endeavor."
