You return to Gridania and hand the parcel to Kipih Jakkya, at which point Lightning once more appears at your side. The lady\x02\x1f\x01\x03knight speaks of her desire to remain in Eorzea, but your bravery has rekindled her own sense of determination. Drawn away by inexorable forces, Lightning returns to a world besieged by chaos and destruction. In whatever distant land she calls home, you are certain that her struggles continue."
