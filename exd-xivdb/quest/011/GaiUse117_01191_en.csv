2,"TEXT_GAIUSE117_01191_SEQ_02","Your eloquent description of the events in Thornmarch serves to confirm the worst fears of the Elder Seedseer and your fellow Scions: like the primals of the beast tribes, Good King Moggle Mog XII was called forth by means of a rite imparted to the Mogglesguard by the Ascians. Papalymo bids you return to the Waking Sands and report these troubling findings to Minfilia while he and Yda discuss the matter of the Scions' compensation with the Elder Seedseer."

After listening to your account, she too is forced to conclude that Ascians were behind both of Good King Moggle Mog XII's recent appearances. Though unquestionably unfortunate, Minfilia reflects that this latest incident did at least provide an opportunity to remind the Elder Seedseer of the Scions' unique role in Eorzea\xe2\x94\x80persuading her to proffer much-needed additional support."
