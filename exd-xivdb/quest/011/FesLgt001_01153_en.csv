At the reporter's insistence, you both tear open the strange parcel to reveal gloves of highly unusual design. Petyr, more than pleased with your contribution to his article, gladly places the handwear into your keeping. You are left wondering, however, who Lightning truly is, and whence the warrior has come."

49,"TEXT_FESLGT001_01153_PETYRWINSOME_000_001","It is nothing scandalous or unseemly, I assure you. I simply wish to interview an adventurer about \x02\x08\r\xe9\x05\xff\x04her\xff\x04his\x03 firsthand experiences dealing with the recent and inexplicable profusion of monstrous wildlife beyond the city gates."
50,"TEXT_FESLGT001_01153_PETYRWINSOME_000_002","I am especially curious about the spawning megalocrabs out at Three-malm Bend, and a particularly ravenous dodo dubbed Gertrude running rampant at Quarterstone. Should you encounter any of these creatures, I would greatly appreciate aught you might share with me!\x02\x10\x01\x03...And though I doubt not your integrity, would you mind returning with some physical evidence of your efforts? I have a reputation as a seeker of truth to maintain, you understand!"
51,"TEXT_FESLGT001_01153_PETYRWINSOME_000_020","A delight to speak with you again, adventurer.

Any tales to mesmerize\xe2\x94\x80and inform, of course\xe2\x94\x80the masses? Hm?"
52,"TEXT_FESLGT001_01153_PETYRWINSOME_000_021","A lady warrior, you say? And she left behind this parcel?"
53,"TEXT_FESLGT001_01153_PETYRWINSOME_000_022","Allow me to confirm the facts. A puissant and powerful woman in exotic raiment appears, introducing herself as \xe2\x80\x9cLightning.\xe2\x80\x9d And after the battle is won, she vanishes like a bolt of the very stuff for which she was named."
54,"TEXT_FESLGT001_01153_PETYRWINSOME_000_023","Finally, left in her blinding wake, you find what can be described as naught else but an \xe2\x80\x9cotherworldly\xe2\x80\x9d package. \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Incredible\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03!
