Unfortunately, the creatures are notoriously elusive, and will need to be lured out of hiding. Journey to Bronze Lake and slay three mud pugils for use as bait."

You can only hope that the gurangatch will regard them more favorably. Place the bait at the water's edge in gurangatch territory and find out if your quarry's tastes truly are so different from your own."

During their tearful reunion, Minfilia explains that her father was once a member of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, and that following his death in a tragic accident, F'lhaminn raised her as her own. After praising Minfilia for her victories over the Empire, F'lhaminn states that the Scions must leave Ul'dah behind if they are to continue their work. Agreeing at last to Alphinaud's proposal, a reinvigorated Minfilia declares that the order will quit Vesper Bay and establish a new headquarters in Revenant's Toll."
