2,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_SEQ_02","According to Alphinaud, the Antecedent's blind refusal to contemplate leaving Ul'dah stems from the empty hope that her late mother F'lhaminn still lives. For whatever reason, rumors have recently begun to circulate that the famed songstress did not perish in the fires of the Calamity. Convinced that Minfilia will not see sense until these rumors have been proven false, Alphinaud has resolved to determine their origin, and asks that you assist him. Speak with Father Iliud at the Church of Saint Adama Landama to learn the source of one such rumor."

It may be prudent to ask Father Iliud whether he believes this man's tale should be taken seriously."
