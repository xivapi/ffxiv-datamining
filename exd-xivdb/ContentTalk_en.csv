20,"Well met! I've been dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild to recruit volunteers for special small-scale operations known as guildhests. You look to be of sound mind and body. Might you consider joining?",4
21,"Wait... Might this be your first time participating in a guildhest? I remember my first hest. It was the night of my twentieth nameday. My fellow guildmates invited me to join them in the slaying of a family of peistes who were stealing chocobo eggs from Bentbranch Meadows.",4
22,"The moment we arrived, one of the terrible beasts immediately turned to me and charged. The thing was thrice my size and had already maimed several chocobokeeps.",4
23,"There was no way I could win, so I simply froze and waited for the end. But that's when I remembered that I was not alone. My friends rallied around me, and together we defeated the peistes! That, my friend, is what a guildhest is truly about.",4
24,"Well met! I've been dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild to recruit volunteers for special small-scale operations known as guildhests.",4
25,"These operations will pit those volunteers against deadly foes, and the odds won't always be in their favor. This is why we require all participants to be of sound mind and body\xe2\x94\x80something that you do not yet appear to be.",4
26,"Time is of the essence. If you have something to ask, make it quick.",4
27,"The operation was a success! Here's your reward, and don't let anyone tell you that you didn't earn it.",4
28,"The operation was a success! Here's your payment, and for your efforts, I've thrown in a little extra, so that you may consider returning to aid us once again.",4
29,"Well, well. It looks like you have a full bag.",4
30,"Can't you see I'm busy attending to your allies? I don't have time to chat.",4
31,"Fall in and make ready!",4

41,"As this appears to be your first time joining us, allow me a moment to explain in detail just what exactly a guildhest entails.",4
42,"More than a simple levequest, but not quite as realm-shaking as a Grand Company outing, guildhests will test your ability to work together with a small party of battle companions to overcome not-so-small obstacles.",4
43,"The duty is taxing, but the coin is decent, and you will be helping maintain the safety of Eorzea and the well-being of her citizens. So, what say you?",4

45,"I can tell by your garb and gait that the tasks I offer are far beyond a \x02\x08\x0f\xe9\x05\xff\x06woman\xff\x04man\x03 of your means. Might I suggest you return once you have honed your skills in the martial or magical arts?",4
46,"Quickly, adventurer. Every moment spent chatting with me is a moment squandered.",4
47,"Excellent work! Ah, but I suppose you will be wanting your reward now. Very good, then. You have more than earned it.",4
48,"A solid performance. You seem to know your way around the battlefield. Here is to hoping that I may work with you again at a later time.",4
49,"Your bag appears to be quite full. You should consider hiring a retainer.",4

When a certain task brought to the attention of the guild is a little too grand for a leve, but not grand enough for Grand Company involvement, they're deemed guildhests and sent to yours truly.",4
62,"But don't let the lack of grandeur fool you. The tasks are anythin' but simple. Most take place in tight quarters, and \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03all\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 require precision teamwork 'twixt you and your battlemates.",4
63,"And so what do you get in return for placing your neck on the loppin' block? Besides a beamin' grin from battlewarden Tiroro Tiro? Fame, fortune, the usual.",4

66,"I can't think of a single reason why you should be over \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03here\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 when the things what need guttin' sit over \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03there\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03. Unless that is, you're fixin' to bolt.",4
67,"Bloody hells, that was brilliant! I never tire of watchin' me a good broil, especially when it's down and dirty. Here's your coin, just as promised.",4
68,"Hah hah hah! A fine display for a first-timer. Here's your well-earned coin. I've tossed in a little somethin' extra to sweeten the deal, so's that you might consider comin' back.",4
69,"I cannot well fit your reward into that pack. She's burstin' at the seams!",4
70,"Wait the queue with the rest o' your battlemates, \x02\x08\x0e\xe9\x05\xff\x05lass\xff\x04lad\x03. There's only one of me, despite the demand.",4

101,"As it is your first time to participate in a guildhest, allow me a moment to explain the particulars.",4
102,"I suppose you are wondering what exactly a guildhest is. The answer to that is simple. A guildhest is a task assigned to small parties of able adventurers, usually to rid the realm of some imminent threat.",4
103,"The tasks, however, are anything but simple. They will require not only battle prowess, but the ability to work with others, conceive and execute complex strategies, and finally adapt those strategies when conditions change...and they always do.",4
104,"My name is Sidonia. I am a battlewarden with the Adventurers' Guild tasked with the distribution and evaluation of guildhests originating here in Coerthas.",4
105,"It is clear that you have journeyed far to come here, and for that I commend you. However, the Adventurers' Guild is in need of someone with experience...something it is also clear you lack.",4
106,"Why is it you stand here speaking with me while the enemy beyond lurks still?",4
107,"I conclude that hest objectives have been completed to the satisfaction of the guild, and therefore hereby present you with your reward.",4
108,"Your performance is deserving of a reward beyond that which was promised in the original accord.",4
109,"You carry quite the burden with you, adventurer. I do not believe the reward I have prepared will fit in that bag of yours.",4
110,"Might I ask you to wait until I have finished serving your companions?",4
111,"Patience, adventurer. There will be time for killing soon enough.",4

122,"Now, here I am. Twenty and five summers since I first picked up a blade, guiding a new generation into the jaws of battle.",4
123,"If it is blood and glory you seek; if it is fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with trusted companions to overcome impossible odds that gives your life meaning; and if you wish to do all this and line your pockets with gil while you're at it, then you need look no further!",4

129,"Ah, a bag bursting with the spoils of war. When I was an adventurer, I, too, would constantly find myself pressed into the difficult decision of what to discard so that I might claim my reward.",4
130,"Eager to collect your reward and move on to the next battle? I understand. That fire once burned hot in me, as well. But for the meantime, I must ask you to wait your turn.",4
