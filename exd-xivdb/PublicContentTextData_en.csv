1033,"Therefore, this binding of two souls, which is commended to be honorable amongst all, must not be entered into lightly, but with sincerity and reverence."
1034,"While none may deny the spiritual bond twixt hearts intertwined, the gods do ask that a symbol be offered\xe2\x94\x80a token to serve as a tangible reminder of the promise made."
1035,"Let us raise up these tokens of our couple's commitment, that the Twelve might pass judgment upon them."

1042,"\x02,\r\xff\x07\x02\n\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03. The Navigator guides us all unto that which we seek. Thus did you happen upon this ring."
1043,"\x02,\r\xff\x07\x02\n\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03. As the Spinner weaves our fates, so too does She weave the fates of all creation. The ring you have brought for your partner was meant for this day from the first."
1044,"Though fraught with peril, the journey our couple embarked upon to see their rings blessed has brought them closer than they could e'er imagine."
1045,"Never will they forget the trials they overcame together. Never will they forget the bonds they forged."
1046,"By the power vested in me by the gods on high..."
1047,"I now pronounce you bonded for eternity!"
1048,"Now, dear friends, let us give the happy couple a warm round of applause!"
1049,"Please use your remaining time in the Ivory Chapel as you wish."
1050,"Plead as we might, the Keeper stalls the hands of time for no soul."
1051,"And so with this we must bring today's ceremony to a close."
1052,"A journey that will see \x02,\r\xff\x07\x02\n\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 and \x02,\r\xff\x07\x02\n\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 to places that they never imagined."
1053,"Greetings friends. Your presence at this joyous occasion is much appreciated."

1055,"Enter, \x02\n\x03\xe8\x02\x03, \x02\n\x03\xe8\x03\x03."
1056,"Those gathered here today shall serve as witnesses to this sacred bond."
1057,"So that none may ever deny it."
1058,"And what tokens of loyalty and companionship do these two offer each other?"
1059,"What symbols of affection will they carry with them always in their hearts and on their hands?"
1060,"\x02,\r\xff\x07\x02\n\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has toiled long to craft this flawless band."

1095,"If there is any person here present who might show just cause as to why this couple should not be so joined, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. If there is none, then allow our couple to read aloud their prepared vows."

1098,"As there are none here present who might show just cause as to why the two of you should not be bound unto one another, you may proceed to read aloud your prepared vows."
