Closer inspection reveals them to be man-made machines. Ashcrown Consortium technologist accompanying party believes them to be of Garlean design. Labels them \xe2\x80\x9cmagitek photocells.\xe2\x80\x9d Collect for further study."

Dispatched two lancers to Gridania with orders to deliver the photocells to Stillglade Fane. Soon after their departure, received linkpearl transmission from pair reporting marked reduction in photocell glow as distance from Maws increased. Recalled lancers."

No choice but to look for it. Divided party into four teams to expedite search. Whisperings of discontent? No. Just my imagination."

Barrier terminal unresponsive until technologist suggests applying set of four photocells. How does he know these things? Watch him. Lancer suggests locating missing team. Decide to press on."

Rock face looks treacherous but descent should be possible with ropes. Return climb may be troublesome\xe2\x94\x80especially with the technologist slowing us down. Lancers seem uncertain. After consulting with second officer, have decided to proceed. Will send scouts to find alternate route back to entrance."

Have lost linkpearl contact with the two scouts sent to find alternate route out. Presumed lost or deserted. Will continue expedition for now, but must consider retreat if situation worsens."

Another two disappeared into the darkness, screaming. Technologist believes cause to be extreme levels of aetheric energy detected ahead. Lies. He has done something to us! The elementals warned me about him. Should have listened. Technologist suggests turning back. I see him for what he is now. Garlean worm is dead. Feel better. Pressing on."

12,"I finally mustered the courage to speak with your hero, my love. \x02,\r\xff\x07\x02)\x03\xeb\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 is as kind and wise as \x02\x08\x0c\xe9\x05\xff\x04she\xff\x03he\x03 is brave and strong. \x02\x08\x0c\xe9\x05\xff\x04She\xff\x03He\x03 listened attentively as I told \x02\x08\r\xe9\x05\xff\x04her\xff\x04him\x03 all about you\xe2\x94\x80about us.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03Though \x02\x08\x0c\xe9\x05\xff\x04she\xff\x03he\x03 is a \x02\x08\x0f\xe9\x05\xff\x06woman\xff\x04man\x03 of few words, or perhaps because \x02\x08\x0c\xe9\x05\xff\x04she\xff\x03he\x03 is, everything \x02\x08\x0c\xe9\x05\xff\x04she\xff\x03he\x03 said seemed to inspire me.

13,"Scarcely a week has passed since we returned to the village, and already I cannot help thinking it was a mistake. There was a time when this place seemed just large enough. But having seen the wider world, it all feels so insufferably confined that I often find myself struggling for breath. I know that it is the same for you, my love.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03The only time I feel truly alive is when I am adventuring with you. We are as caged birds in this backwater. So long as we remain here, we will never spread our wings and soar. So let us take to the road, and create a lifetime of wonderful memories together."
14,"I could not have hoped for a more romantic first visit to Mor Dhona. The crystals that pierce the landscape glowed in all their majesty, as if to celebrate our future together. And as we lazed by Silvertear Lake, watching the waves lapping at the shore, the sun took its leave behind the horizon, that we might enjoy a moment of intimacy.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\x9cI want us to be together forever.\xe2\x80\x9d You first said these words to me years ago, and you said them to me again tonight. I am so happy to be with you."
15,"You have been looking deathly pale of late. The scorching heat of Thanalan does not agree with you. You were never fond of hot climes, and it was a mistake to come here. Let us make for Coerthas, where the bracing air will put roses on your cheeks."
16,"I know, I know\xe2\x94\x80it is not easy being without a body. I promise to find one for you, but you must have patience. You are my husband\x02\x1f\x01\x03to\x02\x1f\x01\x03be, and there is nothing I would not do for you, so please, have faith in me. Give me time, my love, and I shall make you whole again, as you make me."
17,"I am sorry to keep you waiting, my love, but we cannot afford to compromise\xe2\x94\x80not where your new body is concerned. Ordinary adventurers die often enough, leaving their ordinary corpses, but if you are to be like \x02,\r\xff\x07\x02)\x03\xeb\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03, we cannot settle for anything less than extraordinary.\x02\x10\x01\x03But a strong body requires an equally strong soul\xe2\x94\x80as I recently discovered. Now, you are probably worried that strong souls are rare, and so they are\xe2\x94\x80but never fear, for we can create one ourselves! All we need is a plentiful supply of the weaker kind, and they are common indeed. Be patient just a little longer, my love, and all will be as you desire."
18,"With the nigh endless supply of bodies here, I will make you well again, my love. Then we shall be wed as man and wife, and forever be joined as the gods intended. Of course, it is only fitting that a proper ceremony be held, with guests in attendance. I will send out invitations to all our friends. They will be so happy for us, I have no doubt they will jump at the chance to part with their souls."
19,"To whoever reads this\xe2\x94\x80if there is anyone left to read it\xe2\x94\x80let it be known that I, Ser Pascaleret Neurtaille, bore witness to Dalamud's fall. The lesser moon's descent, the black doom which emerged from within, the flames which spread across the horizon, turning night to day\xe2\x94\x80it shall haunt me for the rest of my days.\x02\x10\x01\x03It is the dawn of the \xe2\x80\x9cSeventh Umbral Era,\xe2\x80\x9d according to some of the men. I told them to put no stock in the ravings of the prophetess, but even I do not know what to believe anymore."
20,"The engineers are still surveying the damage, but anyone with eyes can tell that the Dusk Vigil is beyond repair. Some walls are hardly fit to be called as such, piles of crumbling masonry as they are.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03The officers have been pleading with Ser Yuhelmeric, asking him to order a withdrawal. He knows our position is untenable, yet he refuses. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will hold it to the last, for we are the shields on the wall\xe2\x94\x80the defenders of the Holy See,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. He is a brave, pious man. Less so, we who serve under him."
21,"The men we rescued from the collapsed wing have not fared well. Given our dwindling supplies and this seemingly endless blizzard, we may be forced to make difficult decisions soon.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03This unseasonable weather grows worse with every passing day, and the toll it has taken on morale is plain. We have yet to receive reinforcements from the Holy See, and I fear none shall come. Nevertheless, Ser Yuhelmeric remains steadfast in his decision and will suffer no talk of withdrawal.\x02\x10\x01\x03Ser Yuhelmeric's steward tells me he passes hours in the chapel, praying to the Fury for guidance... But I chanced to see him once, as he knelt before the statue. His eyes were transfixed upon the jewel in her helm, and he was whispering things I dare not write."
22,"Ser Yuhelmeric has taken me into his confidence. He says I am an honest man. I wish I were a braver one.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03The mutiny has been quelled. Among the starving, half-mad knights were Ser Yuhelmeric's most trusted officers. He wielded the axe himself.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03Ser Yuhelmeric received me in the chapel afterwards. I told him we will not last a fortnight without food. He smiled and told me that the Fury has blessed us with a bounty of fresh meat, then returned to his prayers. I joined him."
23,"O Halone, pray forgive Your humble servant. For too long have I let fear rule my heart, and in my cowardice have I been party to unspeakable acts.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03I know now I shall never see my children again\xe2\x94\x80nor would I want them to look upon their father's face...and what it has become.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03I am outside Her grace."
24,"Exhibit I: Technology in Daily Life\x02\x10\x01\x03This exhibit showcases the various scientific advances that allow Allagans to live lives of heretofore unheard-of ease and efficiency."
25,"Exhibit II: Technology in War\x02\x10\x01\x03See the myriad marvels of Allagan military technology that have replaced flesh-and-blood soldiers, ensuring that no Allagan citizen need ever again lay down their life in battle."
26,"Exhibit III: The Phantom Ray\x02\x10\x01\x03Feast your eyes on this massive-yet-elegant automaton, designed to monitor\xe2\x94\x80and if necessary, dispatch\xe2\x94\x80potentially violent chimerical constructs."
27,"Exhibit IV: The Mirrorknight\x02\x10\x01\x03A second-generation construct boasting the strength of a bear and the acute vision of an owl. As with many early efforts at synthesis, lack of intelligence and a proclivity for violence limited its practical use."
28,"Exhibit V: The Shabti\x02\x10\x01\x03A fourth-generation construct, and one of the first to effectively employ cloning technology. With high intelligence and regenerative capacity, its development was hailed as a major breakthrough."
29,"Exhibit VI: The Naga\x02\x10\x01\x03Among the first successful efforts in synthesizing a voidsent. Void research remains an emerging field, with future developments holding great promise."
30,"Exhibit VII: The Iksalion\x02\x10\x01\x03A highly intelligent construct employed by Allagan engineers to perform maintenance tasks. Notable flaws include a weakness against the elements and certain genetic instabilities."
31,"The rise of the Garlean Empire in the Year 1522 of the Sixth Astral Era led to significant changes in the structure of Garlean society. This is most evident in the adoption of titles which serve to indicate an individual's place within the social hierarchy.\x02\x10\x01\x03The following information was compiled with the aid of informants within the empire and has yet to be verified:\x02\x10\x01\x03Royalty: Zos - The emperor; Yae - Member of the royal family in the line of succession; Wir - Member of the royal family with no claim to the throne.\x02\x10\x01\x03Military: Van - Legatus; Tol - Tribunus laticlavius or Tribunus militum; Sas - Tribunus angusticlavius or Praefectus castrorum; Rem - Primus pilus or Pilus prior; Quo - Primi ordines or Centurion; Pyr - Optio, Tesserarius, or Decurion; Oen - Duplicarius or Legionarius.\x02\x10\x01\x03Specialists: Nan - Chief engineer or engineer; Mal - Primus medicus or senior magitek technician; Lux - Chief medicus or magitek technician; Kir - Senior medicus or senior technician; Jen - Medicus or technician."
32,"Public Officials: Iyl - Dictator or Princeps senatus; Het - Consul, Praetor, Tribunus plebis, Aedilis, or Quaestor; Goe - Censor; Fae - Unknown; Eir - Unknown; Dus - Lictor.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03This hierarchy extends to the general populace as well, though it is far less complex. The majority of citizens bear the \xe2\x80\x9cBan\xe2\x80\x9d title, and there is a smaller group which appears to be comprised of respected artisans who have adopted the \xe2\x80\x9cCen\xe2\x80\x9d title.\x02\x10\x01\x03The \xe2\x80\x9cAan\xe2\x80\x9d title is bestowed upon the peoples of annexed territories and indicates that they lack even the most basic rights afforded to a citizen.\x02\x10\x01\x03However, many Garleans view this as an opportunity rather than a condemnation, as citizenship may be granted to those who have demonstrated exceptional skills, as well as those who have contributed twenty or more years of military service."
33,"Chapter I\xe2\x94\x80The Six Nativities & Myriad Creation.\x02\x10\x01\x03The spark of Lightning ignites when it strikes, and thus Fire is born.\x02\x10\x01\x03The heat of Fire renders to ash all that it touches, and thus Earth is born.\x02\x10\x01\x03The density of Earth shuns sun and harbors cold, and thus Ice is born.\x02\x10\x01\x03The armor of Ice melts away, and thus Water is born.\x02\x10\x01\x03The moistness of Water mists and rises, and thus Wind is born.\x02\x10\x01\x03The gusts and sighs of Wind gather the clouds, and thus Lightning is born.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03Chapter II\xe2\x94\x80The Three Conquests, Boundless and Unwavering.\x02\x10\x01\x03Earth grounds Lightning.\x02\x10\x01\x03Water erodes Earth.\x02\x10\x01\x03Lightning boils Water.\x02\x10\x01\x03Chapter III\xe2\x94\x80The Three Submissions, Timeless and Unending.\x02\x10\x01\x03Fire is extinguished by Wind.\x02\x10\x01\x03Ice is melted by Fire.\x02\x10\x01\x03Wind is obstructed by Ice."
34,"Though there is some debate as to whether or not Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn and her League of Lost Bastards were the first Eorzeans to discover the western continent, there is no denying that their navigational charts were instrumental in establishing the major trade routes of today.\x02\x10\x01\x03Moreover, the accounts from their expedition are widely regarded as both informative and entertaining. Of particular note is their first encounter with the Mamool Ja, as well as other indigenous peoples and creatures which seemed curiously intent on their demise.\x02\x10\x01\x03These travel journals have since inspired a legion of explorers and treasure hunters to retrace the League's journey. Yet in spite of their numbers, the existence of \xe2\x80\x9ca bleedin' city o' gold\xe2\x80\x9d remains unconfirmed..."
35,"Beauty is ephemeral, but it needn't be. My lady Amandine knows this well, lovely creature that she is. Would that I could have the genuine article in my keeping...but alas, I shall have to settle for a pale imitation.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03The vessel is not quite up to my usual standards, but beggars can't be choosers, as they say. I washed and anointed it per the instructions, then secured it to the bed with chains\xe2\x94\x80wouldn't want her to get ideas above her station, oh no!\x02\x10\x01\x03Gods, just the thought of it is enough to get my blood pumping! I can hardly wait to welcome my beloved succubus into this world!"
36,"The tentacles...so many tentacles! And the sound of it writhing on the bed! Gods, just listening to it is agony!\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03I've made a terrible mistake."
